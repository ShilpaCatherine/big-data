"0||From Alice Springs to Buckingham Palace: the fight for Albert Namatjira's legacy\u201cThis big girl\u2019s got a nice place,\u201d says artist Lenie Namatjira, looking up at Buckingham Palace. It\u2019s 2013, and she and her cousin, Kevin Namatjira, are about to meet Queen Elizabeth and present her with a set of their watercolour paintings. They are following in the footsteps of their grandfather, Albert Namatjira \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s most famous painters, and the first Indigenous man recognised by the colonial government as an Australian citizen \u2013 who did the same almost 60 years earlier. Their journey is being filmed for a documentary feature \u2013 the final element of the Namatjira Project, a sprawling, long-term social justice and cultural development project led by arts organisation Big hArt. In the space of eight years, the Namatjira Project has spawned an award-winning theatre production, internationally touring sell-out exhibitions, painting masterclasses, workshops, and the development of a charitable trust to support Namatjira\u2019s artistic legacy in his own community. But there is a deep irony to this moment: Kevin, who lives in government housing in Alice Springs, is about to be kicked out of his home. While the Namatjira name is intimately associated with Indigenous Australian art and internationally resonant \u2013 last week, for example, Google recognised Albert Namatjira\u2019s 115th birthday with a Google doodle of a painting by another of his granddaughters, Gloria Pannka \u2013 the Namatjira family have been left with very little by way of a material legacy. In 1957, Namatjira gave Legend Press the exclusive licence to reproduce his works for sale, for which he (and after his death, his family) would receive a 12% royalty. But when that agreement expired in 1983, the public trustee managing his estate sold the copyright to Legend Press, and the family\u2019s income stream was cut off. Albert Namatjira learnt to paint through his relationship with Rex Battarbee, a landscape painter from Warrnambool who had retreated into central Australia after the first world war, ending up at the Hermannsburg Lutheran mission. There, he met the young Namatjira, who was working as a cameleer. Namatjira expressed an interest in painting after seeing Battarbee\u2019s works, and with the support of the local pastor, an informal six-week apprenticeship followed \u2013 the sum total of his formal training. Namatjira\u2019s works were incredibly popular when they first came to public attention. His first exhibition \u2013 at Melbourne\u2019s Athenaeum in 1938 \u2013 resulted in the sale of every single exhibited painting. A follow-up show in 1939 also sold out. Over the following decade his profile grew, leading eventually to the artist receiving an audience with a young Queen Elizabeth in Canberra in 1954. But it wasn\u2019t just the upper crust who saw something special in Namatjira\u2019s work. The ordinary public were drawn to it, too. \u201cThere was something romantic about the fact that he was an Aboriginal man who was painting in a way that [audiences at the time] perceived as similar to the way that European Australians painted the landscape \u2013 using watercolours,\u201d says Judith Ryan, senior curator of Indigenous art at the National Gallery of Victoria. While his work was informed by European styles, Namatjira wasn\u2019t painting with a European eye. \u201cHe was painting sites from inside the land,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cThese were sites that were in his country, to which he belonged. He was painting his own being. He was painting himself. This was his identity, in the land.\u201d \u201cHe was a very knowledgeable, very soft man, very powerful,\u201d says actor Trevor Jamieson, who played Namatjira in the Big hArt theatre production about the artist\u2019s life. \u201cThese paintings gave an insight \u2013 they were certain little windows he shared [with] the rest of the world.\u201d But Namatjira\u2019s art was also an entrepreneurial project through which he could provide for his family. At a time when Indigenous people were not even recognised as citizens of their own country, it was unheard of for an Indigenous man to be independently wealthy. Yet the money he made from selling one painting would have taken him more than six months to earn through cameleer work. Namatjira was the first Indigenous Australian to be offered citizenship rights, but these rights did not include the right to purchase property. He was, however, allowed to purchase alcohol, and Indigenous custom meant that his family and friends expected him to share any that he bought. In 1958, he was charged with supplying alcohol to wards of the state after rum was stolen out of his truck. The prison sentence that followed effectively broke him, and he died shortly after his release in 1959. Arts organisation Big hART became involved with the Namatjira family after creative director Scott Rankin and actor Trevor Jamieson met a young painter and Namatjira descendant, Elton Wirri, through another of their projects, Ngapartji Ngapartji. A performer in that project\u2019s touring production, when Wirri was introduced to city audiences as a kinship grandson of Namatjira, the audience interest was palpable. For Rankin, that audience response was significant: \u201cWe wondered \u2026 what was the meaning behind this? Was it just affection? So we looked back through the story and began to talk to the family.\u201d For Big hArt, telling Namatjira\u2019s story involved a long, intimate community consultation process \u2013 firstly to gain the trust of the community, then to work with them to tell the Namatjira story respectfully and appropriately. \u201cThere\u2019s so many variations of the story at play,\u201d says Rankin. \u201cIt\u2019s easy, when you start the research to go, this is so rich, but then you\u2019re going down one line which is only one third of the truth.\u201d But the project wasn\u2019t just about storytelling: there were practical objectives, too. \u201cAt the time, the whole family were living out of one house in Alice Springs, so we were thinking, far out, what can we do to help change this?\u201d says Jamieson. \u201cThey did not trust anybody.\u201d Namatjira Project producer Sophie Marinos says: \u201cThe older Namatjira family members and artists really were desperate to connect with younger generations and to pass on knowledge and skills and the art tradition. That really shaped the community development process.\u201d The importance of the story, for Rankin, lay in how the Namatjira family\u2019s experience could be seen as emblematic of the broader Indigenous experience. \u201cHere\u2019s a family struggling, here\u2019s a family living in poverty and the copyright is owned by somebody else. Although that\u2019s not a huge dollar value necessarily, it\u2019s an incredibly powerful iconic injustice that could speak in much bigger terms if we got it right,\u201d he says. The kind of long-lead, deep engagement that characterises a Big hART project \u2013 never less than 150 weeks, spanning up to a decade, exclusively for the development of new work \u2013 stands in stark contrast to the standard 5-week rehearsal periods for performance production in Australia, and Rankin is scathing of what he calls \u201cnauseating calico-costumed victim narratives\u201d \u2013 he name-checks The Secret River, a novel by a white author, adapted for the stage by a white man \u2013 that dominate theatrical representation of Indigenous cultures. \u201cSomething like Namatjira is actually an experiment in an intercultural exchange,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s neither an Indigenous work nor a non-Indigenous work.\u201d Rather, he says, it is a kind of reconciliation in action \u2013 a community telling a story together and using that story to bring about social justice. The Namatjira Project happened with very little support from Australian government cultural funding bodies. A large proportion of the funding actually came from the UK, because, Rankin says, people over there could see \u201cthe decay at the heart of the Australian narrative\u201d \u2013 the deep contradiction at the core of a story about an Indigenous man whose artistic legacy is so great and yet whose family and community are living in poverty. Jamieson, too, sees the collaboration between himself and Rankin as a kind of continuation of the artistic collaboration of Battarbee and Namatjira, who remained firm friends throughout their lives: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to remind the rest of Australia about the injustices that were made through governmental decisions, and the way white people deceive us to this day.\u201d Producer Sophie Marinos says the feature film, which premieres this week at Melbourne International Film Festival, was developed as part of Big hART\u2019s commitment to creating permanent change, and leaving a material legacy for the communities with whom they work. It tells not simply the story of Albert Namatjira, but the story of a community seeking self-determination against enormous structural obstacles. \u201cThe ideal outcome is that the copyright comes back to the family via the Namatjira Legacy Trust,\u201d says Marinos. \u201cThe trust would be able to support a continuing intergenerational transfer of knowledge that is happening, which is not just about the art movement; it\u2019s actually about health and wellbeing for the community. Because there\u2019s so much that happens in those moments of transfer \u2013 a connection to country, culture, language.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re needing to remake the way in which people think about the Namatjira story, so it\u2019s not biscuit tins and tea towels,\u201d says Rankin. \u201cThis is a story that can change the way in which the country thinks about itself.\u201d \u2022 The Namatjira Project premieres at Melbourne International Film festival on 5 August and is showing in cinemas nationally from 7 September \u2022 This article was amended on 8 August to correctly identify the war Rex Battarbee fought in"
"1||Mo Farah hails 10,000m gold as the greatest performance of his careerMo Farah produced the greatest performance of his career to capture his 10th world championship gold medal \u2013 and send a packed crowd at the London Stadium into rapture. But he had to dig deeper than he has ever done before to hold off the brilliant young Ugandan Joshua Cheptegei and retain his 10,000m title. \u201cYeah, it was my greatest performance ever,\u201d he conceded. \u201cAnd one of the toughest races of my life. The guys gave it to me \u2013 it was about, \u2018How do we beat Mo?\u2019 \u201cYou had the Kenyans, you had the Ethiopians, you had the Ugandans, everybody worked as a team against me,\u201d he added. \u201cBut fair play to them. They worked their hardest and they chucked everything at me. I just had to stay strong, believe in myself and think, \u2018I didn\u2019t work for nothing. I\u2019m losing in my home town. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t.\u2019\u201d At some point, halfway through the race, Farah admitted he was clinging on. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking I was going to lose, but I thought, \u2018This is tough. This is tough.\u2019\u201d The race was also wild and stormy, and several times Farah was spiked by his opponents\u2019 shoes and nearly stumbled on the last lap. \u201cThat trip caught me a little bit on my leg and I got a few cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I just had to be strong. I didn\u2019t want to go down and I had to fight and be strong. \u201cI knew at 12 laps to go when they went hard from there it was going to be tough. It was about believing in my sprint finish and knowing that I have been in that position before. It helped a lot having that experience. \u201cTo have my family on the track is very special.\u201d Afterwards he was sporting a bandage on his left leg but insisted he would be fit to defend his 5,000m crown next week. \u201cI am hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cI just had to be strong now and two doctors are going to look at me. I\u2019ve got a few cuts and bruises but just recover and get ready for the 5,000m. I\u2019ve got enough days.\u201d Farah also paid tribute to the capacity crowd, who urged him on to victory just like they had done on Super Saturday, exactly five years ago. \u201cThe environment\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place like London. There\u2019s no place like home. I love London. I love the people. \u201cI get emotional talking about it but I owe it to the people of London, I owe it to the people of Great Britain and to have the nation behind you, to have so many people to support you, to encourage you, to keep you going, we take it for granted but was really the difference.\u201d Farah, who now has several days off before the heats of the 5,000m, added: \u201cIt was different. Every championships is different. But this was much harder. The guys came up with a lot more of a plan. It felt like they were in a training camp together, how they were working together.\u201d \u201cIt was amazing tonight. I had to get my head round it. I got a little bit emotional at the start and had to get in the zone. It\u2019s been amazing. I had to play with the guys\u2019 heads and get the crowd going. But it wasn\u2019t an easy race, though. \u201cI do work on everything. It\u2019s been a long journey but I try to cover everything in training. Long. Speed. Everything. But what a way to end my career in London. This was special because the guys put it out there. Afterwards Cheptegei also paid tribute to Farah but said he would try again to beat him in the 5,000m. \u201cFor me he\u2019s been an inspiration,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss racing him in the future because his days are already going.\u201d"
"2||Brexit could leave Britain with a bare larder, farmers warnBritain must increase home-grown food production and build stronger supply chains to face Brexit uncertainties, the National Farmers Union has said. In an annual calculation to draw attention to the UK\u2019s decline in food self-sufficiency, the NFU said the national larder would be bare this Sunday if Britain opted for a cliff-edge departure from Europe and imports became unavailable. Such is the reliance on imported food that Britain does not even produce enough of staples including potatoes, beef, milk and cheese to feed the nation for an entire year, it found. \u201cFood self-sufficiency statistics have always been an important measure of the nation\u2019s ability to feed itself. But since the UK voted to leave the EU, and with trade negotiations starting, the supply of British food is now seen in a very different light. Government recognition of farming\u2019s enormous contribution to this country will be vital in the coming weeks and months,\u201d said Meurig Raymond, NFU president. The NFU has called on the government to grasp Brexit as an opportunity to reverse a steady decline in self-sufficiency over the past 30 years. The farming union said that with the right support it would be easy to replace the salad mountain imported from east Africa, pork from countries such as Denmark and New Zealand, and beef and dairy from other EU countries such as Ireland. \u201cWe\u2019re not advocating a fully self-sufficient nation \u2013 we recognise the need for importing food which can only be produced in different climates. But what we should be doing is maximising on the food production we are good at,\u201d said Raymond. The NFU said 30 years ago the country produced 80% of its own food, but now it was 60%. \u201cIf we carry on at that rate of decline we could easily be down to 50% in 10 years, and that is a pretty insecure place to be,\u201d said Raymond. \u201cThe two main responsibilities of any government are to defend its people and feed its people. We are already among the least self-sufficient countries in Europe and dropping to below 50% would be a very insecure position to be in,\u201d he added. With unseasonally cold snaps in places like Spain causing vegetable shortages this year and the threat of drought in big exporting nations like the US, over-reliance on other countries for food is a national security risk. Raymond said he believed the public appetite was there for British food and \u201cnot ready for hormone-treated beef\u201d, which is banned by the EU but could find its way on to UK supermarket shelves after Brexit under a trade deal with the US. The NFU said farming was such an important contributor to the economy \u2013 generating 3.9m jobs and revenues of \u00a3109bn a year \u2013 that the government needed to recognise the sector\u2019s needs. The NFU said it wanted a clear transition period after Brexit, during which the UK will remain in the customs union, that the UK remained within the external tariff area, which would guard against the country being flooded by cheap imports of questionable quality. Raymond said the environment secretary, Michael Gove, was beginning to recognise the importance of a transition period in behind-the-scenes talks with farmers, although \u201cthere is no commitment\u201d. The NFU plea came as 14 farming organisations, including the British Poultry Council, the Soil Association and the Country Land and Business Association, set out a list of Brexit demands. They too want the government to manage the risk of Brexit and stay within the customs union during a transition period. They also want \u201ca fully functioning immigration system\u201d that recognises the reliance food producers have on EU workforces beyond the harvest season. Raymond said the NFU also wanted the government to stop viewing these workers as unskilled but rather as highly competent workers on whom the food growing and packing industry relied."

"4||We underestimated Corbyn, says Theresa May's ex-chief of staffNick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former chief of staff, has insisted the prime minister is not on a path to a softer Brexit, as he revealed he was still in contact with the prime minister since resigning in the wake of her disastrous election result. Timothy, who was May\u2019s right-hand man for six years, claimed he was not still advising her but expressed a view that she was not giving into demands from some colleagues for compromises on her Brexit red lines of leaving the single market and jurisdiction of the European court of justice. \u201cThe fundamental things that the country voted for, that we will leave the EU, control immigration, that the court of justice should have no jurisdiction in this country, that we should stop paying membership fees \u2013 I\u2019m confident that those things will end,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all the talk from some people that we must seek some sort of partial membership of the European Economic Area or something like that, the intention of the government has been clear from the beginning \u2013 that if you seek a partial relationship the danger is that you will be in the worst of all worlds, where you will be a rule-taker with none of the advantages of being in, but you will also sacrifice some of the advantages of being out.\u201d He argued that May was still prepared to walk away with no deal with the EU, despite her not repeating the claim that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d in recent weeks. \u201cIt would be a bad thing if we got into a situation where there was no deal for all concerned, but there are circumstances where Britain would have to be prepared to walk away. \u2018No deal is better than a bad deal\u2019 isn\u2019t just a slogan, it means something,\u201d Timothy said. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph in his first interview since the Conservatives lost their majority, Timothy partially accepted responsibility for the failures of the campaign, saying they underestimated the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. But Timothy went on to make the case for the Conservatives to maintain the spirit of the manifesto he co-authored, which contained policies such as lifting the ban on grammar schools and an unpopular social care shakeup that was branded a dementia tax. He said: \u201cOverall the lesson of the election for the party and for the government cannot be: \u2018Oh well, we tried that and we didn\u2019t win the election we were hoping for so let\u2019s not try it any more\u2019. \u201cIf the party retreats to a much more orthodox Conservative proposition then I worry that won\u2019t be sufficient to tackle the big problems that the country has, and in five years\u2019 time we do risk the election of a dangerous leftwing alternative.\u201d Asked if he was still in touch with the prime minister, Timothy said: \u201cI have spoken to Theresa a few times since the election. But I haven\u2019t seen her and I\u2019m not advising her on policy. They are private conversations \u2013 people catching up.\u201d He claimed May was a victim of sexism from those who claimed he was the brains behind her premiership. He said: \u201cShe has done a very good job of stabilising things since the election which disproves that theory anyway, but I do think there\u2019s more than a hint of sexism, to be honest \u2013 there\u2019s a sort of implication that even having become prime minister she somehow doesn\u2019t have a set of beliefs and a programme of her own, and she obviously does. Suggesting I\u2019m the creator of those ideas is absurd and insulting to her.\u201d Timothy is expected to write columns for two newspapers after maintaining silence since he resigned the day after the election. A number of Tory MPs called for him and Fiona Hill, the other co-chief of staff, to go after the election, accusing them of controlling behaviour. Katie Perrior, May\u2019s former communications chief, branded the pair \u201crude, abusive and childish\u201d and there were reports of rows with Philip Hammond, the chancellor. In the Daily Telegraph interview, Timothy downplayed those accusations, saying: \u201cWe probably didn\u2019t communicate as well as we could have done, directly with the public and the media, and probably to a certain extent around Whitehall.\u201d He claimed reports that May had intended to sack Hammond after the election were wrong and maintained there has been \u201cno rift\u201d between the pair, just a \u201cbusinesslike\u201d relationship. Timothy did not explicitly blame anyone else for the presentation of May at the front and centre of the campaign but hinted this was the influence of outside adviser Sir Lynton Crosby, rather than the internal Downing Street team. \u201cOur early instinct when we were thinking about the election was to have a more traditional campaign: daily press conferences, more policy content \u2013 certainly not make it a semi-presidential campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t do those things because the advice was about playing to strengths, and to be perfectly honest I didn\u2019t really challenge that. I was in a position to change this and I didn\u2019t. With hindsight obviously we would have done it differently. The \u2018strong and stable\u2019 slogan wasn\u2019t necessarily a problem, but looking back we would have been much better off with a message showing we understood the need for change, and we were the people capable of delivering it.\u201d"
"5||Extreme weather deaths in Europe 'could increase 50-fold by next century'Deaths from weather disasters could increase 50-fold in Europe by the start of the next century if no action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or protect citizens, researchers have warned. A new study estimates a toll of 152,000 deaths a year between 2071 and 2100 as a direct result of hazards relating to extreme weather, with those living in southern Europe likely to be the hardest hit. \u201cGovernments and policies should be focused more on designing suitable adaptation measures,\u201d said Giovanni Forzieri, a co-author of the study from the European Commission Joint Research Centre in Italy. \u201cIf no adaptation measures [are] taken, these estimates are really alarming.\u201d Writing in the journal Lancet Planetary Health, Forzieri and colleagues describe how they used state-of-the art predictions to explore how often and where seven types of weather disasters \u2013 including heatwaves, wildfires and floods \u2013 are likely to occur across Europe in the coming years if no action on global warming is taken. The analysis also used large datasets from disasters in recent years to calculate a fixed value of human vulnerability for different weather events, and incorporated projections on how populations were likely to change. Looking at the impact on Europeans over 30-year intervals, the team found that two in three people in Europe could be affected by weather-related disasters annually by the period 2071-2100 \u2013 an estimated 351 million people. By contrast, between 1981 and 2010, 25 million people were exposed \u2013 just 5% of Europe\u2019s population. What\u2019s more, the number of deaths is expected to increase 50-fold by 2100, reaching an estimated 152,000 deaths a year \u2013 up from 3,000 a year between 1981 and 2010. Those living in southern Europe, including Italy, Spain and the south of France, are predicted to be the hardest hit with about a 64-fold increase in deaths. This rise, say researchers, is largely down to heatwaves, with the phenomenon expected to account for 99% of the additional deaths. Overall, more than 90% of the increased risk to Europeans, the authors say, is down to an increase in the frequency and severity of weather events as a result of climate change. The remaining 10% is a result of population growth and migration; for example, increased numbers living in coastal regions likely to flood \u2013 a problem particularly in Slovenia, Ireland and Norway. \u201cPopulation change will play only a marginal role compared to climate change [in increasing risk],\u201d said Forzieri, adding that historically the reverse was true. But, Forzieri notes, the analysis does not take into account indirect effects on public health, warning that problems ranging from cardiovascular disease to mental health disorders could become more prevalent, while pressures on health services and other resources could also take their toll. Weather-related disasters, the authors add, are also likely to disproportionately affect the sick, poor and elderly \u2013 a factor they say is a concern given the ageing population across Europe. Indeed, Forzieri says, the reality could be even more dire. \u201cOur scenario is not the worst one we could choose \u2013 it is the medium scenario of greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d he said. The authors stress that the research highlights the importance of the Paris climate agreement, adding that improved city planning and public awareness are crucial. But David Alexander, professor of risk and disaster reduction at University College, London, said the study took too simplistic a view. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are in any way capable of predicting what death tolls as a result of weather-related hazards will be by the end of the century, because there are so many other factors, which in this study are not taken into account, that will have a direct bearing on the figures,\u201d he said. In particular, Alexander pointed out the study assumed a straightforward relationship between the number of people exposed to a disaster and the number of deaths, to calculate vulnerability. \u201cWhether you are in the way or not doesn\u2019t actually determine whether [an event] kills you or not,\u201d said Alexander. \u201c[Vulnerability] is dependant on a whole mass of things.\u201d Paul Wilkinson, professor of environmental epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described the study as a \u201cthought experiment\u201d but welcomed the research. \u201cWhile the analysis only considered extreme events, and assumed no reduction in human vulnerability over time from adaptation, it is yet another reminder of the exposures to extreme weather and possible human impacts that might occur if emissions of greenhouse gases continue unabated,\u201d he said."
"6||The leaked transcript of Turnbull's call with Trump shows him at his worstAbout a week after Donald Trump was inaugurated as president of the United States, he had a phone conversation with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. The call focused on the deal earlier done with the Obama administration, under which the US would take a number of refugees currently held in Australian offshore detention centres on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus island and Nauru, and Australia would receive a corresponding number of people the US wanted to resettle elsewhere. At the time the deal was disclosed, its terms were very vague. In particular, no numbers were given: no one could tell just how many people from Nauru or Manus would be resettled in the US. The transcript of the phone call, released by the Washington Post, discloses several uncomfortable things. Firstly, the number to be resettled in the US is entirely up to them (according to Turnbull). More fundamentally, Turnbull\u2019s discussion with Trump is troubling because it shows that Turnbull has so little understanding of refugee issues and so little concern for the Christian faith he claims to follow. Trump was obviously confused about the number of refugees covered by the deal. Turnbull made it clear that the US could, if they wished, take none at all. He said: \u201c\u2026The obligation is for the United States to look and examine and take up to and only if they so choose \u2013 1,250 to 2,000. Every individual is subject to your vetting. You can decide to take them or to not take them after vetting. You can decide to take 1,000 or 100. It is entirely up to you. The obligation is to only go through the process\u2026.\u201d So, Turnbull told the president of the United States that all the deal required was that the Americans go through the vetting process, and if eventually they took no refugees at all, that would be consistent with the deal. Of course, it was not consistent with the way the deal had been described to Australians when it was first made public. In November 2016, Turnbull refused to say how many people would be resettled under the deal, but gave the impression that America was committed to taking a non-trivial number. Trump expressed his concern about the possibility that the refugees might be terrorists. He said: \u201cTRUMP \u2026. This ISIS thing \u2013 it is something we are going to devote a lot of energy to it. I think we are going to be very successful. TURNBULL: Absolutely. We have, as you know, taken a very strong line on national security and border protection here\u2026\u201d Trump referred to the fact that the US had once received a number of prisoners who had been released by Castro in Cuba and went on to underline his concern that the refugees might be terrorists. He said: \u201cTRUMP:\u2026. you remember the Mariel boat lift, where Castro let everyone out of prison and Jimmy Carter accepted them with open arms. These were brutal people. Nobody said Castro was stupid, but now what are we talking about is 2,000 people that are actually imprisoned and that would actually come into the United States. \u2026 We have our San Bernardino\u2019s, we have had the World Trade Center come down because of people that should not have been in our country, and now we are supposed to take 2,000. It sends such a bad signal. You have no idea. It is such a bad thing. TURNBULL: \u2026none of these people are from the conflict zone. They are basically economic refugees from Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. That is the vast bulk of them. They have been under our supervision for over three years now and we know exactly everything about them\u2026.\u201d This did nothing to alter Trump\u2019s view. The conversation continued: \u201cTRUMP: \u2026I will be honest with you. I hate taking these people. I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people. TURNBULL: I would not be so sure about that. They are basically \u2014 TRUMP: Well, maybe you should let them out of prison. I am doing this because Obama made a bad deal. \u2026\u201d Clearly Trump believed he was being asked to resettle criminals. He seems not to understand that a country like Australia would imprison innocent people for years. Turnbull, despite his experience as an advocate, did nothing to dispel Trump\u2019s misunderstanding and said nothing to justify jailing innocent people for years. After all, what sort of government would do that? Turnbull must know that the Australian public are labouring under the belief that people seeking asylum are \u201cillegal\u201d. His government has called them \u201cillegal\u201d and, by treating them as criminals, has induced the public to believe they are criminals. It must be obvious to Turnbull that his party\u2019s treatment of people seeking asylum since 2001 has led the US president, and most of Australia, to believe that the people held on Manus and Nauru are criminals. It is the lie on which the Coalition has made itself popular. It is the lie which is essential if the public is not to see the grotesque hypocrisy of self-styled Christians locking up innocent people for years as a warning to others. Presumably Turnbull understands that boat people are not criminals, but prefers not to say so. But worse: he referred to them as \u201ceconomic refugees\u201d. It is a meaningless term. A person who is just looking for economic advantage is not a refugee. A refugee is a person who is unwilling to return to their country of origin because of a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution\u201d. It has got nothing at all to do with seeking economic advantage. In short, what the transcript shows is that Turnbull is unclear about what a refugee is; he is willing to punish innocent people for years in order to deter other people from seeking asylum, and he is content that the Australian public continue to believe that boat people are punished because they are criminals, when the truth is that they are innocent people being mistreated as an example to deter others from seeking help in Australia. It is not surprising that Turnbull is troubled about the release of the transcript: it shows him at his worst. Julian Burnside QC is a barrister who specialises in commercial litigation and is also deeply involved in human-rights work, in particular in relation to refugees.

"7||Brendan Rodgers: I aim to make Celtic the best, I don\u2019t care about the restIt felt appropriate that the eve of another Scottish Premiership season was dominated by Celtic\u2019s reaction to a Champions League qualifying draw. It is on that grander stage that Brendan Rodgers and his players are widely judged, amid the perception of the domestic scene being less competitive than is healthy for anyone. The reality is Celtic\u2019s achievements in Scotland last season were exceptional. Completion of trebles have been rare enough throughout history without the significant add-on of Celtic being unbeaten whilst doing it. Rodgers raised the bar to the point where it is legitimate to ask what can be done next; meaningful impact on that European stage is a key Celtic target. But first, the unfurling of a league flag. Celtic kick-off the Scottish top flight with the visit of a Heart of Midlothian team plunged into turmoil by a horrendous League Cup performance and the subsequent sacking of their head coach. Here starts the Rodgers quest for improvement which, domestically at least, is tricky to envisage. This is not, of course, any fault of Rodgers. The former Liverpool manager demonstrated during the 2016-17 season that the failure of other Scottish teams to lay a glove on Celtic did not impact on motivation at all. Nonetheless, it is surely unarguable that Celtic and Scotland would benefit from increased challenges from more capable teams. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d shrugged Rodgers on Friday when asked whether he expects anything relating to a title chase in this campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t need to worry about that. My worry is to make us the best I can.\u201d Rodgers was similarly bullish on whether or not Celtic actually need to be pushed to a stronger extent. He clearly realises the desire to push a tiresome Old Firm narrative which has arguably harmed the Scottish game more than it has helped it. \u201cNo. Others need it but we don\u2019t,\u201d said the Northern Irishman. \u201cOur measure is that we want to be the best we can be. We know what it takes to compete in European football. That\u2019s our measure. \u201cSome people will say we need a strong Rangers, strong Aberdeen, strong Hibs \u2013 but that\u2019s no good if you\u2019re not strong. \u201cOur standard we set ourselves, no one else helps us set it. That was my approach last year when I came in and it was exactly the same throughout the season. \u201cFor people on the outside looking in, there\u2019s maybe not so much to write about when the gap is 20 points or 39 points. But for us we set our standard. \u201cI think it is great of course for the game if you have that \u2013 a team one point ahead or whatever \u2013 but it is not going to define how I work every day. I always try to work at a world-class level. That is then the demand for the player. I don\u2019t need, with all due respect, to know what Rangers are doing or Aberdeen, Hibs, Hearts to motivate me. I\u2019m not going to have a lazy day because we are winning by 20 points.\u201d It remains difficult to assert whether or not Rangers will be stronger in this, their second season back in the Premiership. Humiliation at the hands of Luxembourg opposition in Europe placed the manager, Pedro Caixinha, under an element of pressure which will intensify again if Rangers make a slow league start. Celtic appear the far more stable \u2013 and talented \u2013 of the major Glasgow clubs. Aberdeen will inevitably suffer from the loss of Jonny Hayes \u2013 to Celtic \u2013 and must recover, too, from European disappointment after failing to hold on to a lead taken to Cyprus on Thursday. It is a sign of the gulf even between the clubs who finished first and second last season that the man who may well prove to be Aberdeen\u2019s best player, Ryan Christie, will not be available for matches against Celtic because they are his parent club. Neil Lennon\u2019s recruitment \u2013 and experience \u2013 means Hibernian are likely to enjoy a strong season after winning last season\u2019s Championship. Hearts, meanwhile, arrive in Glasgow still reeling from what became the inevitable departure of Ian Cathro. Rodgers used pre-match media duties to defend the 31-year-old. \u201cI had never come across him before but he clearly has the talent,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cYou don\u2019t go abroad and work at the clubs he has done and gained those experiences if you are not. He has gone to Newcastle, slotted in there and he has had good experience. \u201cThe board, more importantly at Hearts, thought he was good enough and thought it was the right time to come in. But throughout his time there it always seemed as though he was up against it. He\u2019ll be better for the experience. I told him that after the clouds, always comes the sun and not to worry because this sharpens your teeth. \u201cI am a wee bit disappointed for Scottish football because he is clearly someone who was trying to work a certain way and to develop players and make them better. I am not sure you have so many of them up here, that\u2019s the brutal honestly of it. I am not so sure there is that. What he\u2019ll have learned is that, when the spotlight is shining upon you, it\u2019s completely different from being a coach or an assistant manager. I think he\u2019ll go away, he\u2019ll be disappointed of course but, being so young, he will get an opportunity and his next club will get the benefit of his experience at Hearts.\u201d"
"7||England\u2019s Lucy Bronze hits out at referee after Euro 2017 defeatLucy Bronze was the last player to leave De Grolsch Veste on Thursday night and, as she patiently fulfilled every request for her time, one wondered how she found the energy. The willingness of this England team to front up en masse after setbacks puts certain others that wear the same badge to shame but the tireless Bronze, who was among the few to stand out in the desolating 3-0 defeat to Holland, cut the most bullish figure of all. While many of her team-mates remarked on the need for rest and reflection to salve the wounds, the Manchester City defender gave the impression that only the waiting bus was preventing her from getting back out on to the pitch and finding her own cure. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could be any more determined after what happened at the World Cup [when England also lost in the semi-finals] but with what has happened and what we have been through at this tournament, I am,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a stab in the heart \u2013 tournaments don\u2019t come around too often and I\u2019m not getting any younger.\u201d Anger was driving Bronze too. She is a gifted attacking right-back who would almost certainly be at ease anywhere on the pitch; England relied frequently on her initiative and, at 2-0 down with 17 minutes to play, one characteristic foray brought an appeal for a penalty after a tackle by Sherida Spitse. Nothing was given, the referee St\u00e9phanie Frappart probably deeming Bronze had gone down before the challenge was made, but she had also been close at hand when Ellen White was denied a first-half spot-kick and said those incidents had contributed to England\u2019s defeat. \u201cThe crowd played a huge part and a lot of decisions went against us at key points \u2013 crucial, game-changing decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we had got one of the penalties it would have silenced the crowd and given us a chance of equalising at the end. I\u2019ve watched them back and I can\u2019t see how at least one wasn\u2019t given. On my one, I even said to the referee: \u2018If you think I went down too early, the girl was steaming in, I\u2019ve got to protect myself, so if you think I\u2019ve dived give me a yellow card.\u2019 There was no yellow card, she didn\u2019t make a decision. It\u2019s either a penalty or a yellow card. In my eyes, something wasn\u2019t right there.\u201d Bronze also felt Holland were \u201cgood at breaking things up and knowing the ref wasn\u2019t seeing it, so continuously doing it\u201d. The officials\u2019 inactivity was an underlying theme broached by several England players but it was Bronze who articulated it the most stridently and perhaps her frustration owed in part to that nagging concern over the advance of time. At 25, she is playing the best football of her career. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not old, not yet, but we will keep knocking on the door,\u201d she said. Bronze\u2019s powers are unlikely to start declining for a few years but England had felt Euro 2017 was there to be won and it is unlikely rivals such as France and Germany, both well below par this summer, will not come back strongly when the former host the 2019 World Cup. \u201cThe team is in a good place,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fighting fit, ready for the next tournament. We\u2019ve got a good core of players who will still be around and we\u2019ve got some good young players coming through. I think we\u2019re all more determined than ever to get to the World Cup final, that\u2019s the aim.\u201d Bronze will certainly have earned senior player status by then and England will hope to have learned their lessons. \u201cWe did everything we could but unfortunately some things are taken out of your hands,\u201d she said. In truth they had been well beaten but perhaps, after such a humbling night, the fire that still raged in Bronze\u2019s eyes will be a light to guide them."
"1||Katarina Johnson-Thompson inspired by memories of London 2012Over the past few weeks Katarina Johnson-Thompson has been repeatedly watching recordings of London 2012, allowing the memories to flood back in the hope they will assist her in winning a medal this time. They show a 19-year-old completely at ease with making her senior debut before the biggest crowd she will probably ever experience, grinning as she joined Jessica Ennis-Hill\u2019s lap of honour on that heady Super Saturday. She was already being proclaimed the next golden girl of athletics after breaking Ennis-Hill\u2019s junior British heptathlon record a few months previously and a 15th-place finish at the Olympics only increased the expectation. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching the old videos quite a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cThat stadium is always going to hold a special place in my heart and it definitely brings back a lot of emotions. I feel like I\u2019m fully prepared now. In 2012 I was just going along with the wind really. Now I can look back and feel like it is a special time. I\u2019m fully prepared to try to make new memories in the stadium that I can cherish forever.\u201d The intervening five years have been as drama-filled as one of the soap operas Johnson-Thompson used to play bit parts in as a child who had a penchant for performing arts as well as sport. She won a European under-23 heptathlon title and a European indoor pentathlon title in 2015. But mental demons and physical frailties have hampered her performances on the big stage, most notably at the Beijing world championships two years ago when three fouls in the long jump ruined any medal aspirations. At the Rio Olympics last summer there was more heartache when she finished sixth, struggling \u2013 as she so often has \u2013 in the throwing disciplines. But, at 24, Johnson-Thompson feels like her time is now. \u201cIn a way I feel I\u2019m going into London with the worst things in my life having happened that can possibly happen in a sporting environment,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m prepared for almost anything. I can come out the other side and I can handle it, so I\u2019m not working myself up as much as I did in previous years. I can go into it and relax, knowing that my events are up to standard and hopefully I can get the best performance out of myself.\u201d A move away from her long-time coach Mike Holmes to a new training base in Montpellier, close to France\u2019s Mediterranean coast, has lightened her mood and improved her points score. Since last year Johnson-Thompson has been coached by a trio of Frenchmen, headed by Bertrand Valcin, and she counts the Olympic decathlon silver medallist K\u00e9vin Mayer and multiple European heptathlon champion Antoinette Nana Djimou among her training partners. \u201cIt\u2019s just given me a fresh outlook on everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like it was time for a change and it\u2019s definitely been the right move to mentally step away from everything in England and be without a care in the world in the south of France. \u201cI\u2019m not taking anything away from my previous coach, he always got me on the line in decent form, but it was the preparation beforehand where my mind was on whether my body would be OK or whether I could deal with the pressure. I was scared to get injured. I\u2019ve just been able to focus on technique now and just being the best I can be. I don\u2019t have any responsibilities at all in France except to train.\u201d Unfortunately for Johnson-Thompson, she is not the only heptathlete in London who feels she is in the form of her life. Nafi Thiam, the Olympic champion, won gold in G\u00f6tzis in May with a stunning score of 7,013, the best anywhere in the world for a decade. Germany\u2019s Carolin Sch\u00e4fer and Latvia\u2019s Laura Ikauniece-Admidina kept Johnson-Thompson off the podium in G\u00f6tzis, even with a personal best score of 6,691. Johnson-Thompson acknowledges Thiam\u2019s greatness but she is not writing off the possibility of winning gold. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that she\u2019s unbeatable,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like you can never say that in a heptathlon or any type of sporting event because you never know what might happen \u2013 especially over seven events. If she performs the way she can it would be quite special to get two 7,000-point scores in one year, especially in the championships.\u201d She will also be drawing on the crowd she has been reminded of by those videos to inspire her to raise her game. \u201cNaturally in the heptathlon I feel like my performances will go up another level and the British crowd can help me along,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like the three girls who beat me in G\u00f6tzis have taken heptathlon to this special place where anything goes. I\u2019m going to try and latch on to that mentality and why not?\u201d"
"7||Andrea Radrizzani gives himself five years to get Leeds United promotedThe new owner of Leeds United, Andrea Radrizzani, has warned that if he fails in his five-year plan to get the fallen Yorkshire giants back to the Premier League he will look to sell the club. Radrizzani, 42, completed his takeover of Leeds from the controversial Massimo Cellino this summer. He then delighted fans by bringing Elland Road back under club ownership. But while the Italian says he will continue to try to foster good relations with supporters and the local community, the Premier League is his be all and end all. \u201cI am giving a maximum of five years to be in the Premier League,\u201d Radrizzani said in his first interviews with the national media. \u201cIf I try and I am not able then it is probably best for someone else to try, maybe with more resources than me. \u201cIf I go up I\u2019m not selling. I am young, I can stay here for 20 years and enjoy. It\u2019s a dream; why build all of this if I then have to leave? If however in five years I don\u2019t succeed \u2026 obviously there is a cycle for everything. It could be the end of the cycle if I realise I am not good for this job. Life is full of surprises but now I can\u2019t wait to be in [the Premier League].\u201d Radrizzani says he became aware of the opportunity to invest in Leeds through a chance conversation with Kenny Dalglish. \u201cInitially when I was looking to enter football I was looking at clubs in Italy or France or Spain, a mid-table club where I could develop players and eventually sell them,\u201d he said. \u201cI had opportunities in other countries \u2013 I never thought about England and Leeds United. \u201cBut then I was at a lunch with friends from London and also Kenny Dalglish, before Manchester City were playing Paris Saint-Germain in Manchester. We were casually speaking about the legacy of Leeds United and how good it would be to bring back Leeds to the glory. It was the first time I was hearing about the history of Leeds and the potential. I love challenges in my life and I love to turn around organisations.\u201d Leeds have been out of the top flight for 12 years but their owner, who says he has invested \u00a3100m in the club to this point, believes that the financial gap can be bridged without extended investment. Radrizzani, who made his fortune trading TV sports rights, says that opportunity comes from the revenues available in the Premier League, which he believes will remain substantial for some time to come. \u201cThere is hope to catch up, as long as Leeds get to the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel with a project an idea and people of quality we can close the gap on clubs with a different budget.\u201d Key to this are broadcast revenues, with the Premier League set to begin negotiations on a new round of rights this year. \u201cI think what we could see in the next few years is a huge change in the consumption of media,\u201d Radrizzani said. \u201cIt\u2019s started already. Try to imagine if every Premier League match was now available via Amazon or Netflix. The audience could be much bigger, the single price per client could be lower, the total amount would still be bigger. \u201cIf we look at Sky the clientele and subscription I think you see the consumer is tired of paying for a bundle. To pay \u00a370 for 200 channels when maybe they just want to watch sports or football and maybe some movies or TV series. That has been shown clearly on the entertainment side because Netlfix has broken the market on pay-TV with entertainment. Can this happen with sport? I think so.\u201d Radrizzani spent \u00a320m through his company Greenfield Investment to bring Elland Road back under Leeds\u2019 ownership, after the club was forced to sell and lease back the ground to an unnamed owner following the collapse of another takeover bid in 2004. \u201cIt was not simple,\u201d Radrizzani said of the deal. \u201cThe club has an option to buy but the counterpart pretended this option was not valid any more. It wasn\u2019t easy, it was a difficult negotiation.\u201d The owner has also sanctioned the arrival of 11 players and signed the young prospects Ronaldo Vieira and Kalvin Phillips to extended contracts as well as bringing a new manager and director of football to the club \u2013 Thomas Christiansen and Victor Orta. Of Christiansen, Radrizzani said: \u201cI liked his approach, very humble but at the same time very motivated to become the coach of Leeds. He was prepared and for the first time I saw a manager come in with a powerpoint and details \u2026 This was very important, details because it means someone is hard-working, in two days he prepared. He was humble, but motivated. \u201cWhat is important to me, what I care about and what I think I have found with the manager is to have the ambition to win every game. This particular league is very long and it\u2019s important to try and win the game. Eventually sometimes you might lose it, but you try to win the game. You try to have an offensive approach to the game. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to find a local English manager that could give me the comfort to play for a win with good football,\u201d he went on. \u201cI couldn\u2019t identify many options, unfortunately. It\u2019s something that everyone in the English environment should work on, to improve the number of coaches.\u201d Radrizzani says he hopes he has also begun a process of reestablishing bonds with the local community after years of tension and he called on fans to stick with the club. \u201cI think we have started this process,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have been engaging with the community, the city council, the fans, the foundation. Everyone is now together, around the same table, with the same goal and the communication is very active so... concrete action has already started to happen. The supporters have been very positive generally and I just wish and hope this positivity remains in the time when some weekends we are sad, because we need their support. And for sure football is up and down.\u201d"
"7||Ars\u00e8ne Wenger confident Arsenal can prosper from Champions League absenceFor Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the boot is on the other foot \u2013 well, almost. The Arsenal manager flagged up a trend at the end of last season when he noted that Chelsea and Leicester City, the two most recent Premier League champions, were unencumbered by the demands of European football during their triumphant campaigns. \u201cBecause the league is so physically difficult, maybe it is very difficult to cope with both,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe will see how Chelsea respond next season.\u201d Arsenal\u2019s league campaign ended in frustration when they finished fifth, meaning they missed out on Champions League qualification for the first time since 1997. But at least they had freed themselves up for a clear run at the domestic title. Not quite. Wenger\u2019s team have the small matter of participation in the Europa League this time and, as he prepared for Sunday\u2019s Community Shield against Chelsea \u2013 a rerun of May\u2019s FA Cup final, which Arsenal won 2-1 \u2013 he made it sound like a small matter. One of the keys to Arsenal\u2019s season will be how they contend with the Europa League, with the unique Thursday-Sunday scheduling that it entails. Will Wenger rest his first-choice players to have them firing for the more serious business of the league? Yes, he suggested. That would be the plan. \u201cI will always play a team that has a good chance to win the next game,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cIn the Europa League, if we can afford sometimes to rest some players, we will do it. But we have to adapt to the level of the competition and see, first, what kind of group we play in.\u201d Wenger had earlier been asked how he felt before a season with no Champions League football. \u201cFor us, it is a good opportunity to focus completely on the Premier League,\u201d he replied. The manager has signposted his intentions and it may be a popular move to give some of the club\u2019s younger players \u2013 such as Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Reiss Nelson and Joe Willock \u2013 an opportunity in the Europa League. Wenger intends to sell a clutch of players, including Calum Chambers, Mathieu Debuchy, Carl Jenkinson, Kieran Gibbs and Lucas P\u00e9rez, but his squad will remain extremely deep. Wenger offered further insight into his feelings towards the Europa League when he said the winners ought not to be granted entry into the Champions League. He even revealed he had voted against the proposal, which came into force in the 2014-15 season. To him, a big club should not view the Europa League as a kind of insurance policy in terms of Champions League qualification. \u201cYou cannot go into the season and think that,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI was always against it [the Europa League winners qualifying for the Champions League] because, at some stage, it can influence the championship. If a team is in a position in April where they have more chance to win the Europa League, they can let some games go in the championship and not completely focus on the regularity of the competition. \u201cApart from Manchester United last season, who won the Europa League [having started in the competition], all the years before it was always a team who was kicked out of the Champions League [that won it]. That\u2019s why, when we voted in Geneva [for the route into the Champions League], I was always against it.\u201d Wenger\u2019s numbers do not bear scrutiny. Since the format of the Europa League \u2013 then the Uefa Cup \u2013 was changed in 1999-2000, only seven clubs have lifted the trophy after dropping down from the Champions League. Arsenal almost won it in that first season, after entering through the Champions League, only to lose the final to Galatasaray on penalties. Wenger\u2019s team finished last season 18 points adrift of Chelsea but they showed in the FA Cup final they could get the better of them over 90 minutes. \u201cLast year, Chelsea did not play in the European Cup and, certainly, they were a bit more consistent in the Premier League,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cIn the final, we have shown that the gap was not as high, maybe. We have to show that again on Sunday. I expect Chelsea to fight for the championship again and for us, when we have made 75 points, as we did last season, the target is to get 10 points more. With 10 points more, you are in there.\u201d Wenger is still there, in situ at the Emirates Stadium after all of the uncertainty over his contract renewal last season, and he is gripped by that eternal optimism. \u201cI am sorry I am still here,\u201d he said, with a smile. \u201cI can understand that you want to kill me but, at the moment, I survive.\u201d Here we go again."
"7||Harry Kewell: 'I want to bring something different to the game'Broadfield Stadium is so nondescript you almost miss it on arrival. Tucked deep in West Sussex suburbia, among green parks and house developments, is the home of Crawley Town. Small, unfashionable but friendly, for most of their 121-year history the club was a non-league entity of little renown. Crawley only climbed into the Football Conference in 2004 and six years ago they reached their highest level ever in League One. Today they sit in League Two after narrowly avoiding the drop last season. It remains, perhaps, an odd destination for a player who won the Champions League, FA Cup, Uefa Super Cup, a PFA young player of the year award and an FA Youth Cup winners medal during his stellar Premier League career to make his first step into senior management. But Harry Kewell, a son of Smithfield in western Sydney, doesn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cThis club\u2019s very ambitious for me as well so it kind of fit,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a believer that you have to make things happen, you just can\u2019t wait for the perfect this and that. This is a great opportunity for myself and the club.\u201d Guardian Australia meets Kewell in Crawley\u2019s front office on a hot summer\u2019s day. He has been putting his team through its paces in preparation for the new campaign that starts at home against Port Vale. At the age of just 38, tanned and tattooed, Kewell looks fit enough that he could still tear down the left flank as he did for Leeds United, Liverpool and the Socceroos. But management is his goal now, his new ambition and as he professes often, his new love. In May Kewell was appointed the new boss of Crawley following the departure of Dermot Drummy. He had spent two years in charge of Watford\u2019s Under-23s, but after hanging up his boots in 2015, this is his first taste of a first-team role. \u201cI fully enjoyed myself at Watford but I was frustrated because you\u2019re there as a role to help the first-team. As much as you want to create ideas yourself, you\u2019re very limited because of the players. Your role is to create players to go into the first-team and I\u2019m very happy with what I created there. \u201cI felt personally I needed a new challenge and luck, as it happened, Crawley were looking for a new manager. A young manager, very ambitious, very hungry but has to have a good family background because this is a very family-orientated club.\u201d To some, Kewell\u2019s decision to go into coaching was a strange one. He was Australian football\u2019s first real star, a player with the good looks, a TV star wife and dazzling skills that helped finally put football in the national conscious at the turn of the 20th century. With his work for fashion brand Politix, his academies and media appearances, management seemingly wasn\u2019t in his future. There is also the old adage that great players rarely make great coaches. Kewell even admits he had no thoughts of becoming a coach while he was still playing, with those coming after retirement. \u201cI never rarely saw myself as a great player, so maybe I\u2019m out of that bracket. [But] for me, I love this. When I first did my badges, I remember my first assessment was defending corners and organising the team and getting players into position. When I started playing football I had this fire, this burning desire of \u2018wow I love this\u2019. And that\u2019s what I got when I coached from that very first assessment. I just went \u2018this, this is what I like\u2019. I love coaching.\u201d Kewell is buzzing with enthusiasm for the new season to get underway. The task at Crawley is a sizeable one \u2013 the Reds finished 19th of 24 teams in League Two, just five points above the relegation zone. The job is not only to stay up but to potentially try and push for promotion. Turkish millionaire Ziya Eren bought the club 19 months ago and has big plans. Kewell has already made his mark by bringing in seven new players, including his former Watford charge Dennon Lewis, and letting five go. In pre-season results have been respectable with five victories, a 1-1 draw with a Chelsea development XI, and defeats to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Portsmouth. \u201cIt\u2019s a changeover, it\u2019s a new management that\u2019s come in,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was their first full-on season last year. It takes time to create something. People feel they can create something in a heartbeat \u2013 it can\u2019t happen. You\u2019ve got to get a good foundation first and then you can start building on top of that. I think this club is starting to build a good foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s a test for me. I\u2019m a young manager. I\u2019ve got some players in their thirties and they\u2019ve got their ideas as well, but they\u2019ve got to take the lead off me. My door will always be open for the players but they know where they all stand. We\u2019ve been busy, we\u2019ve got some excellent players here already but we\u2019ve brought some quality players in as well. We\u2019re looking good.\u201d During his career Kewell played under some of football\u2019s best managers for club and country \u2013 Guus Hiddink, Rafa Benitez, Terry Venables and Frank Rijkaard. But he is determined to develop his own individual style and coaching philosophy. \u201cI want to bring something different to the game. I don\u2019t want to sit there and play the way or coach the way Benitez did or Hiddink did. I don\u2019t think you can replicate them because that\u2019s what makes them great managers; they have their own ideas. But there\u2019s certain things off the field, like how they\u2019ve handled certain things, certain situations. That\u2019s helped. I\u2019m a strong believer that you learn on the job.\u201d Crawley are ambitious but so is Kewell. No Australian has ever managed in England\u2019s professional Football League, let along in any of Europe\u2019s main leagues. Australians may have played with and against Europe\u2019s best but coaching is a different matter. Kewell wants to be the first to break the mould. \u201cI was always a big dreamer when I played football, I always wanted to play at the highest level and vice versa. There\u2019s no difference in being a coach. I want to see how far I can go. If you want to be the best, you have to be amongst it. This opportunity for me at Crawley has come at the right time. It\u2019s going to be tough. They came 19th last season, they had a great start but really faded away. So it is going to be tough, but I\u2019m looking forward to the challenge.\u201d One day managing in the Premier League or even the Socceroos, Kewell isn\u2019t ruling anything out. The first step in the journey starts at Crawley Town. \u201cYou never know. If they [the Socceroos] come calling, you never know. There\u2019s a few people lined up, a few of my ex-team-mates, and they\u2019ve done very well. [But] this is not an easy job. You\u2019re always getting scrutinised, whether you win or lose. People are going to have a go. So you have to have thick skin in this game, but I wouldn\u2019t do it if I wasn\u2019t up to the challenge. I love it. I will give as good as I get.\u201d"
"1||Mo Farah storms to 10,000m gold at World Athletics ChampionshipsEven now, as Sir Mo Farah hurtles towards his 35th birthday and the finale of the greatest career in British athletics\u2019 history, he retains a stunning capacity to find a way \u2013 a way to defy his opponents, a way to defy critics and, most of all, a way to defy Father Time. As the bell sounded for the final lap of a stormy and enthralling 10,000m final a group of brilliant young East Africans were on his shoulder, poised to strike. They included the hugely talented 20-year-old Ugandan Joshua Cheptegei and two Kenyans in their mid-20s, Paul Tanui and Bedan Muchuri. At that moment Farah stumbled and nearly tripped. He still refused to go down or lose his nerve. Afterwards he needed stitches on a cut on his left leg, which was bandaged. Even around the final bend they were lurking, sensing blood. Instead, urged on by a delirious 56,000 crowd, Farah found his familiar full-throttled sprint finish to claim yet another world championship gold medal in 26min 49.51sec, \u2013 his fastest time for six years \u2013 with Cheptegei second and Tanui third. He admitted afterwards it was the greatest performance of his career. \u201cThey went so hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew it would be tough and I had to believe in my sprint finish. But it was one of the toughest races of my life. The guys gave it to me.\u201d This victory means Farah now has an unprecedented 10 consecutive global track distance titles. To put that into context, Haile Gebrselassie won six in a row at 10,000m and Kenenisa Bekele\u2019s run of consecutive 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic and world titles ended at four. And, among all the greats in track and field history, only Usain Bolt has more world and Olympic medals. Even at 34 there seems no diminishing of his powers. To Farah the normal rules of just do not apply. Earlier, when the big screen in the stadium showed him jogging on the warm-up track, wearing a oversized white bobble hat and breezily grinning at a team-mate,, the crowd erupted into cheers. But that was nothing compared with the electric welcome that greeted him when he stepped on to the track an hour later. At that point it was almost five years to the minute since his golden 10,000m victory on London 2012\u2019s Super Saturday \u2013 a victory that turned him into an overnight hero. In the United States, where Farah is based, a five-year anniversary is celebrated with silverware. But there was no way he was going to settle for anything other than gold. As he glared across the track he saw some familiar rivals: including Geoffrey Kamworor, the reigning world cross-country champion and world silver medallist and Tanui, the Olympic 10,000m silver medallist. As always he looked them up and down, throwing his fists like a boxer as he probed for any weaknesses. As Neil Black, British Athletics\u2019 performance director, likes to explain: \u201cWhen Mo stands on the start line, he believes he can run the last 400m faster than anyone in that race. He believes if he had to fight anyone there, he could kick the shit out of them.\u201d There were also the Ethiopians Abadi Hadis and Jemal Yimer, the proud holders of the fastest times in the world this year, that Farah was keeping an eye on. Hadis, in particular, had clearly kicked on from his 15th in Rio, having placed third at the World Cross Country Championships . Yet Farah knew he had the two most valuable trump cards in the race: not only the fastest time in the field but a devilish sprint finish that none of his opponents could match. The only realistic worry was whether he might suddenly get old overnight \u2013 or his rivals interrupt his rhythm. Certainly they could not expect that the recent negative headlines that have surrounded Farah following the leak of some of his athlete biological passport data by the Russian hackers Fancy Bears last month would affect him. Last year he had to fend off questions about his relationship with the controversial coach Jama Aden, who was arrested after the blood boosting drug EPO was found in the hotel where he was staying in Spain \u2013 yet he still won double gold at the Rio Olympics. In 2015 he had to shrug off allegations made against his coach Alberto Salazar made by the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme and again left a major championships with two gold medals. Others might have got distracted. Farah simply developed tunnel vision. But he had to dig deeper than ever before to win. So many times in the past Farah\u2019s opponents have sat back and turned a 10,000m race into a 600m sprint. And time and time again they have seen him destroy them on the last lap. This time they ganged up on Farah, desperate not to relive their Groundhog Day again. From the gun Cheptegei immediately hit the front with Kamworor right behind him. The first 1,000m came and went in 2:39 \u2013 faster than usual for a major championships. Yet Farah was unmoved and was content to sit in 16th place, 20 metres behind the lead, waiting for them to come back to him. It was a choppy race, with plenty of surges in speed interspersed with slower moments. Yet Farah was never allowed to feel comfortable. At one point, halfway in, Farah pushed into the lead \u2013 only for the Kenyans to throw in a 63-second lap to move him back to 11th. From a long way out Farah knew this was not going to be a procession but a real race. But he was helped by the crowd who urged him on with every step. All evening they had wildly cheered the sight of every British vest. But now they were clapping and stomping and urging Farah on, creating a giant wall of noise. Repeatedly Farah was confronted by traffic and tangled with Kenyan legs. With three laps left the pack was down to nine and everyone appeared flat out. Yet still the intensity increased. Farah knew that every time the lap counter ticked down his greatest strengths were increasingly coming into play. And when the bell sounded, he kicked hard again. Just over 50 seconds later he crossed the line and, once again, enjoyed sweet delirium."
"1||World Athletics Championships 2017: Mo Farah wins 10,000m gold \u2013 as it happenedFarah gets his medal from Seb Coe, with the stadium still packed. That was just a fabulous race, and a wonderful start to these championships. We\u2019ll be back with more tomorrow. I leave you with a bit of related reading. Bye! Joshua Cheptegei, who came second, is only 20 \u2013 he turns 21 next month. His time of 26:49.94 was a personal best. He came sixth in the Olympics last year, and looks one for the (near) future. Farah is still posing for family portraits on the track. I can confirm that Holly Bradshaw qualified in the pole vault, incidentally. That was, by some margin, the fastest Farah has ever had to run to win a gold medal. Here\u2019s a breakdown: Uganda\u2019s Joshua Cheptegei came second. Kenya\u2019s Tanui too third. Farah runs straight into the crowd, and emerges with four children to milk the applause. Just brilliant. Fabulous drama, just wonderful stuff. They tried this time, but there\u2019s no stopping Farah! Farah stretches clear in the home strait! The bell rings. Farah is at the front, with Tanui now to his right, the first of three Kenyans in his slipstream. Two laps to go, and Farah and Hadis run shoulder to shoulder in the lead. 9,000m run, and Farah remains well placed. There are nine athletes now in the leading pack. Farah leads! Not for long, mind. Abadi Hadis goes again, and Kamworor follows, but Farah is third and still running smoothly \u2013 though as I write that, Farah and Kamworor tangle legs, but keep upright. Six laps to go. The crowd are on their feet. The distance races are absolutely the finest events that athletics has. Long enough to give you drama, to tell a story. Several stories, if you\u2019re lucky. A 66sec lap. Farah sits sixth. \u201cThese guys are running hard, but a lot of them are going to fall apart in the last few laps,\u201d says Steve Cram. There are nine laps to go. Aron Kifle of Eritrea takes over at the front. After a couple of 61sec laps, the last couple have been slower again. This is fascinating stuff. Farah has slipped back again now, waiting for the pace to drop. Which, it seems, it has. Once again, the 15 men at the front bunch up. The pace slows further, the athletes bunch, and then, suddenly, Bedan Muchiri starts running. Kamworor follows, Tanui third. Three Kenyans at the front, moving fast. Can Farah keep this under control? The pace slows, and Farah suddenly moves forward, gesturing to the crowd, asking them to roar louder. Clever move, this: the leaders know that the louder the crowd roars, the closer Farah is. Kamworor is still just off the front, pushing. Paul Tunui is in third, another Kenyan. Meanwhile at the front Joshua Cheptegei points to his side, asking someone to take over in the lead, and nobody seems keen to volunteer. Tunui eventually does so. Joshua Cheptegei takes over at the front. There seems to be a Kenyan/Ugandan joint plot in train here to make this fast and hard and leave Farah behind. Time will tell. Geoffrey Kamworor leads the field after 2000m, with Farah about seventh from last, not bothered, running his own race. I agree with this. The 100m is fabulous, but it\u2019s a bit too brief to be really savoured. The 10,000m is under way! The crowd starts to roar. 27 minutes or so of roaring to go. It was five years ago today that he won over this distance in this stadium at the Olympics \u2013 and the roaring certainly never let up then. Bolt was the joint eighth fastest 100m qualifier. \u201cThrowing may look bewildering today, but it is the one activity where no animal can outdo us humans,\u201d notes gentsracer. \u201cWe\u2019re uniquely gifted in that field. Hence our superiority when chasing down our prey in that other age.\u201d The 10,000m athletes are coming out, with fireworks going off on both sides. Mo Farah is met with a predictable roar. Yes, but what\u2019s going on with the women\u2019s pole vault? That was not classic Bolt. It may have been the blocks, he might just have been a bit distracted, or still digesting his nuggets. Tomorrow he might have a fight on his hands. Bolt blames the equipment for his stumbling start: I\u2019m not into these blocks. I think they\u2019re the worst blocks I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s not as steady, it\u2019s not as firm, as I\u2019m used to. Bolt starts slow but finishes fast, as is his wont, and he flies through in first place. Dasaolo comes second, and Vicaut third. Britain\u2019s James Dasaolu is also in this final 100m heat, along with France\u2019s Jimmy Vicaut, who has run 9.97 this year and has a personal best of 9.86. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see him meet his destiny,\u201d says Denise Lewis, sounding a little bit like a Bond villain, about Usain Bolt. Usain Bolt is on the track. Nobody\u2019s booing him. Gatlin wins quite easily. Kim Kukyoung of Korea \u2013 or \u201cKim the Korean\u201d as Steve Cram has it on commentary \u2013 comes second. With Roto red-carded and Chavaughn Walsh pulling out with injury, there were only six people in the race, so half of them go through. There\u2019s a false start here too, and Thando Roto is responsible! So that\u2019s his race run. He argues his case with the official sent to usher him back down the tunnel, but down the tunnel he does indeed go. The penultimate 100m heat features Justin Gatlin, who earns a few boos from the crowd when he is introduced. Thando Roto of South Africa, in lane nine, has precisely the same best time this year as Gatlin\u2019s: 9.95sec. Now they\u2019re off! And Ujah on the inside starts well and qualifies, while Belcher on the outside starts terribly but comes through to take third place, while in the middle Bingtian Su of China wins. In other news, Mo Farah\u2019s warm-up is discotastic: A false start! Mosito Lehata of Lesotho is up way early, and that\u2019s his night over. The two fastest men in the fourth 100m heat are on the two outside lanes: America\u2019s Chris Belcher in lane nine, and Britain\u2019s CJ Ujah in lane two. Belcher set personal bests in 100m and 200m at the US trials in Eugene in June, running 9.93sec over the shorter distance, his only ever sub-10sec time. Holly Bradshaw\u2019s pole vault event has started: having passed on the first two heights she clears 4.50 at the first attempt. Prescod has qualified in third place! He starts excellently and keeps it going, coming in behind Forte and Meit\u00e9! Heat 3 of the 100m includes three sub-10sec athletes in lanes four, five and six \u2013 Akani Simbine of South Africa, Ben Meit\u00e9 of Ivory Coast, and Julian Forte of Jamaica \u2013 and Britain\u2019s Reece Prescod in lane one. In the long jump, Jeff Henderson\u2019s final jump is much worse than his second, but is at least legal. It\u2019s eventually measured at 7.84m, which means the 2016 Olympic gold medallist is out! Blake started terribly and had to fight hard to go through in third. Abdul Sani Brown won ahead of China\u2019s Zhenye Xie, and looked very graceful doing so. Yohan Blake is on the track: he goes in heat 2, also in lane nine, and is the only athlete in the heat ever to go below 10sec. Coleman crosses the line first in 10.01, and looks very comfortable doing so. Jak Ali Harvey comes second, with Cejhae Greene I think third. The men\u2019s 100m heats are about to start. Christian Coleman\u2019s 9.82sec makes him the fastest this year in the first heat, and he goes in lane nine. Bolt goes in heat six. \u201cI think the throwing events all go back to some ancient warlike practices,\u201d writes Jonathan Gresty, in response to my discus-inspired bewilderment. \u201cUnlike many other sports, they do reflect some kind of useful atavistic human function.\u201d Clearly this is true, but the discus is to ancient warlike practices what a poodle is to a wolf: clearly in some way related, but very distantly indeed. In the men\u2019s long jump, Jeff Henderson executes a beautiful leap well beyond the qualifying mark, but his big toe landed a little long, so it doesn\u2019t count. The 2016 Olympic gold medalist needs to get his third jump right now, but has clearly got the form. Sarah McDonald came ninth in the final heat but is also through, as one of the fastest losers, so all four Britons have done the job. Kipyegon, Meraf Bahta, Besu Sado and Laura Weightman are all through. Klosterhalfen faded in the finale but clung on to sixth. Konstanze Klosterhalfen is dictating this one, and is in the lead at the bell, with Kipyegon just behind her. The last 1500m heat features Faith Kipyegon, the Kenyan Olympic champion, and two Brits: Laura Weightman and Sarah McDonald. Muir speaks: I just wanted to get through it, saving as much energy as possible. Really happy. Job done. Just wanted to get in the top six. It\u2019s great to get started, it felt like it was a long time coming. The first five cross the line almost simultaneously, and Muir is among them, with Sifan Hassan winning. Gudaf Tsegay, Malika Akkaoui, Jennifer Simpson and Hanna Klein are also through. This heat is much slower than the first, and as a result everyone is still bunched with a lap to go. Anyone could go through, but the fastest losers won\u2019t be coming from this one. Muir\u2019s tactics are precisely the opposite of Judd\u2019s: she spends most of the first lap right at the back of the pack. Another 1500m heat is about to begin. Britain\u2019s Laura Muir has the best personal best of the 15 involved, but it\u2019s packed with quality. Robert Harting is among the athletes to pass the qualifying mark in the discus. The throwing events are all a bit bewildering. Flinging metal and plastic discs for no obvious reason is a strange way to make a living, isn\u2019t it? The men\u2019s long jump qualifiers have begun. Anyone who jumps beyond 8.05m, or the 12 best, go through: Luvo Manyonga of South Africa does so at the first attempt. Jess Judd talks. She seems pleased. Her time of 4:03.73 was a personal best: I can\u2019t believe it. I think the crowd were just amazing. I really controlled it. The last lap I was hurting a bit. I thought I was going to have to run the race of my life to get through. I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m just so happy. As they go round the final bend Judd gets overhauled: five women overtake her, but sixth is good enough. That was, mainly thanks to Judd, a fast race. Dibaba wins it, followed by Semenya. Into the final lap and Judd still leads, with Dibaba on her shoulder. The crowd is, it must be said, going wild. Jess Judd has gone out in front from the start. She ran her personal best of 4:05.20 in Watford a couple of months ago, and a repeat would comfortably see her through. Caster Semenya is the most famous face in the first heat, with Britain\u2019s Jessica Judd and Ethiopia\u2019s Genzebe Dibaba, the defending champion and the only woman in the race to have gone under 4min this year, also involved. The women\u2019s 1500m heats are next on track. There are 14 runners in the first heat and 15 in the other two; the first six in each race go through, and the six fastest losers. For completists, the two fastest losers in the 100m preliminaries both ran in the final race. They are Amdoul Riffayn of Comoros and Jean Batambok of Cameroon, whose time of 10.71 was a personal best, and they both go into the first round. Gittens, of Barbados, duly wins. New Zealand\u2019s Joseph Millar follows him home, with Warren Fraser of the Bahamas third. The final men\u2019s 100m preliminary race features Ramon Gittens, whose personal best of 10.02 is the best of all the athletes in the prelims. Discus rules: anyone who throws 64.5m will go through to the final, or if less than 12 people manage that, the 12 best of the night. The men\u2019s discus competition has started, with Iran\u2019s Ehsan Hadadi first out. He, um, throws it quite well. The third 100m heat is won by Slovakia\u2019s Jan Volko in a personal best time of 10.15, followed by Mario Burke of Barbados and Abdullah Mohammed of Saudi Arabia. I am not convinced by Hero the Hedgehog. Turkey\u2019s Emre Zafer Barnes wins comfortably, with Hassan Saaid and Walsh joining him in the next round. Tamoa, tragically, came last. In the next heat, Chavaughn Walsh of Antigua &amp; Barbuda looks the fastest. Tuvalu\u2019s Ielu Tamoa, on the other hand, has a personal best of 12.73 and seems unlikely to trouble Usain Bolt or, indeed, most other people. Three go through to the first round, and three scream way clear of the remainder: Matadi is the winner, followed by Odhiambo and Canada\u2019s Brendon Rodney. The first race is about to be run! It\u2019s a men\u2019s 100m preliminary heat. The fasted man in the race is Mark Otieno Odhiambo of Kenya, who set his personal best of 10.14 this year. Emmanuel Matadi of Liberia has the same personal best, but has only run 10.18 in 2017. I think 20 minutes was about right, but there was much too much speaking, and nowhere near enough mass dancing and absurd novelty costumes. Sadiq Khan\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t bad, to be fair. It just wasn\u2019t very well choreographed. Well, that\u2019s it. Perhaps the most half-hearted opening ceremony in the entire history of opening ceremonies. Sadiq\u2019s still going. There are now only three minutes of opening ceremony left. They\u2019d better be amazing. And another speech from Sadiq Khan. The last five minutes had better be good. And another speech, from Sebastian Coe! We\u2019re halfway through the opening ceremony, and some volunteers doing some singing is very much the highlight so far. And now \u2026 a speech from the Duke of York! \u201cLadies and gentlemen, my mother the Queen is sorry she is unable to be here this evening,\u201d he begins. Rebecca Ferguson comes on to sing the national anthem, in a dress so long she can\u2019t get over the trackside camera track thingumy without assistance. Question of the day: The opening ceremony has begun! A choir comprised of 2012 Olympic volunteers are singing Elbow. It\u2019s actually not bad, but I don\u2019t think Beijing are feeling any sense of inferiority quite yet. I haven\u2019t seen much of this year\u2019s mascots, sadly, but it\u2019s early days. Tonight\u2019s schedule in full: 6pm: Opening ceremonials 7pm: Men\u2019s 100m preliminaries (there will be four of these, and nobody with a personal best below 10sec is involved, so Usain Bolt will still be eating chicken nuggets at this point) 7.20pm: The first lot of men\u2019s discus qualifiers Sweden\u2019s Daniel Stahl, the favourite for gold and author of this year\u2019s biggest throw, is involved here 7.30pm: Men\u2019s long-jump qualifiers South Africa\u2019s Luvo Manyonga has the first, second, third and fourth-biggest jumps of the year to his name, and is 2/7 favourite 7.35pm: Women\u2019s 1500m first round This will feature the first British athlete of the evening, Jesica Judd, in heat one, though Laura Muir in heat two is a better bet for success. Holland\u2019s Sifan Hassan, also in heat two, is the favourite 7.45pm: Women\u2019s pole vault qualifiers Britain\u2019s Holly Bradshaw is in Group A, while the favourite, Greece\u2019s Ekaterini Stefanidi, and America\u2019s Jenn Suhr, are in Group B 8.20pm: Men\u2019s 100m first round This is where the big boys come in 8.45pm: The second lot of men\u2019s discus qualifiers Featuring Jamaica\u2019s Fedrick Dacres, the second favourite 9.20pm: Men\u2019s 10,000m final A certain Mo Farah is after his third world title and 1/3 favourite. The next six in the betting are all Kenyan or Ethiopian, led by Geoffrey Kamworor. The only two people to run faster than Farah this year are both Ethiopian: Abadi Hadis and Jemal Yimer, whose marks, as well as the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth fastest times of 2017, were all set in the same race, in Holland on 11 June. 9.53pm: Men\u2019s 10,000m medal ceremony 9.55pm: That\u2019s yer lot So the crowd have already got to cheer two lots of British medalists \u2013 both women\u2019s 4x400m teams \u2013 before the action has even started. They are, in the meantime, giving some medals to people cheated out of medals because of drug cheats in 2009, 2011 and 2013. Aha! That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t start for half an hour! The BBC seem to be ignoring the opening ceremony in favour of chit-chat. Hello world! So, it begins. The IAAF World Championships will start at 7pm BST, about an hour from now. Before that, though, we\u2019ve all got an opening ceremony to savour. Here\u2019s what we know about it so far: The programme will include performances by the renowned British soul singer Rebecca Ferguson who will sing the national anthem and perform her hit song Glitter and Gold, and The Games Maker Choir, formed by volunteers who participated at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, who will perform One Day Like This by Elbow, as a tribute to the legacy of the volunteers of those games and to those who will be volunteering at the IAAF World Championships London 2017. The ceremony will be hosted by Iwan Thomas, the 1997 world 4x400m champion, and 1998 European and Commonwealth 400m champion. The pre-show will begin at 6pm with a reallocation ceremony for five 4x400m relay teams and two 400m runners whose finishes at the 2009, 2011 and 2013 World Championships have been upgraded following the disqualification of the results of the original medallists after their sanction for anti-doping rule violations. So far as I can tell, that leaves two questions for me to answer: Question 1: How come I don\u2019t remember Rebecca Ferguson\u2019s hit single Glitter and Gold? Answer: Because they are using a very loose definition of the word \u201chit\u201d \u2013 the official UK chart company also have no recollection of it, but according to Wikipedia it reached No116, and that was in 2012. They have presumably chosen a five-year-old No116 smash because it has the world \u201cgold\u201d in it. Question 2: What does a World Championships opening ceremony look like? Will there be flocks of sheep, gaggles of geese, Kenneth Branagh and the Queen jumping out of a helicopter? Answer: Don\u2019t get too excited. It\u2019s no Olympic opening ceremony, to be sure. But it might look something like this (though this is from Beijing, where they really go to town on their opening ceremonies):"
"8||The week in patriarchy: does anyone in this White House use their brain?In the never-ending game of Trumpian musical chairs, everyone loses a seat and no ever wins. Spicer is out, the entertaining Scaramucci is out, and once again we\u2019re stuck reeling over the sheer number of controversies in this presidency that never seem to sink anyone. At least, not yet. My new strategy, for the time being, is just to ignore it all and put my head down. We all need a summer vacation from this mess and the fight will still be there in the morning.

"1||Usain Bolt makes sluggish start to world 100m after beef with the blocksUsain Bolt always manages to retain a veneer of being unbothered by his rivals but he was unable to hide his distaste for the starting blocks being used at the world championships. The Jamaican wants to sign off with one final 100m title to add to his 11 world and eight Olympic golds but admitted he needs to repair his relationship with the blocks in order to triumph on Saturday. The 30-year-old looked exasperated after winning his heat in 10.07sec despite a terrible start. \u201cThese are the worst blocks I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d he said, \u201cIt was very bad, I stumbled out of the blocks, I\u2019m not fond of them, I have to get my start together. \u201cDuring the warm up I fell back on the blocks, they\u2019re just not what I\u2019m used to, they\u2019re not as firm and sturdy.\u201d The first sight of Usain Bolt at these championships coincided with Justin Gatlin leaving the track after winning his heat. Suddenly the boos for the pantomime villain \u2013 a twice convicted drugs cheat \u2013 dissolved, replaced by cheers of \u201cBolt, Bolt, Bolt\u201d. During his warmup, he jogged to the 60m mark spread his arms wide into a crucifix position to the flash of thousands of cameras. On the start line there was a knowing grin, a mock expression of surprise, a bow of acknowledgement and \u2013when his name was finally announced to the stadium \u2013 a display of shadow boxing. Bolt\u2019s British rival CJ Ujah urged organisers not to turn this championships into a retirement party for Bolt but clearly the message had not been relayed to the crowd who responded wildly. \u201cIt\u2019s always wonderful,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cThey always show me so much love and I appreciate it, I\u2019m looking forward to getting to the finals and doing my best.\u201d This season more than ever before, Bolt has seemed fallible, running sub-10 seconds just once. He has also struggled with a back injury and had to overcome the emotional trauma of the death of his close friend, the British high jumper Germaine Mason, in a motorcycle accident. On the evidence of the heats he is not unbeatable. The most impressive of his rivals on first inspection was Christian Coleman, the fastest man in the world this year. The 21-year-old ran 9.82 in June, making him the fourth quickest American in history. He won his heat from lane nine in 10.01 easing down and alleviating any concern that the gruelling US college season had left him low on energy. \u201cThere was a lot of excitement and energy in the building,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to calm myself and keep composed. I don\u2019t feel any pressure, I just want to do what I\u2019m capable of because I live with the results.\u201d Bolt\u2019s compatriot Yohan Blake has been identified by many as his principal rival for gold but \u201cThe Beast\u201d got a terrible start from lane nine in his heat. The 27-year-old clawed his way back to take second place in 10.13. Ujah also had a safe passage, finishing second in his heat in 10.07. The Londoner remained calm after a false start in his heat when Mosito Lehata from Lesotho was shown a red card. He got a good start but was overtaken by China\u2019s Su Bingtian, who won in 10.03. \u201cI was really relaxed just didn\u2019t want to overcook it,\u201d Ujah said. \u201cIt was nice to get out there, the London world champs it can\u2019t get any better than this, I just want to make it to the final now. Ujah\u2019s room-mate Reece Prescod lowered his personal best to 10.03 to qualify from the inside lane with a superb run. The 21-year-old, a surprise victor at the British trials last month, is from Walthamstow, just three miles from the Olympic stadium."
"7||Sunderland 1-1 Derby County: Championship \u2013 as it happenedRight, thanks for your company. Here\u2019s Michael Walker\u2019s match report from the Stadium of Light: Simon Grayson speaks. \u201cI thought we played well, it was always going to be difficult when you have that hangover from last season,\u201d he says. \u201cI though [Scott] Carson made some very good saves and we asked a very strong Derby side a lot of questions tonight. We are trying to make sure we give this set of supporters something to cheer about.\u201d So, the wait goes on for Sunderland. They are still without a league win at the Stadium of Light since 17 December last year, against Watford. But, they gave it a good go tonight, and that was a far more spirited performance than some of those meagre displays under David Moyes last term. Both teams will feel as though they could have won it, too. Chris Martin and David Nugent both missed sitters as far as they would be concerned, while Lewis Grabban rattled the post for Sunderland. Grabban\u2019s first goal for the club ultimately earned the Black Cats a point after Bradley Johnson\u2019s opener. Mmmm ... some immediate post-match reaction: \u201cIt is not easy when you get relegated, the lads can lack confidence or things like that, but I thought we showed a lot of fight,\u201d says Sunderland skipper Lee Cattermole. \u201cI think it is a positive result for us.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s honours even and probably a fair result,\u201d says Derby\u2019s Tom Huddlestone. No second-half goals then, but plenty of near misses. 90+2 min: Nugent fluffs his lines! That was a massive chance, but he totally misses the ball, with just the keeper bearing down on him. Bryson nods the ball in to him but the Derby striker gets it all wrong. A huge let-off. 90 min: We are in to the final minute of two minutes of added time. Derby are having one last go at it ... 88 min: Oliver Langford, the referee, rushes over to James Vaughan to book the striker after a late, reckless challenge on Richard Keogh. He immediately went over to put out any fire there. A striker\u2019s tackle, you would say. Meanwhile, Craig Bryson is on for the closing stages. 87 min: A spicy finish as Galloway and Vydra take a few lumps out of each other, with Sunderland eventually winning a free-kick just inside the opposition half. Browning tries to meet it but he\u2019s left shortchanged by the Derby back line. Grayson\u2019s all thumbs-up, geeing the troops. 84 min: Lee Cattermole has his head in his hands, after failing to make proper contact with Billy Jones\u2019s cross from the right. It was a lovely, deft ball in but the Sunderland captain made a mess of it from about six yards out. The strikers, Grabban or Vaughan. would have loved to have a go at it. 83 min: Forsyth allows Honeyman to slip inside him and the Sunderland youngster ploughs into the box, with the Derby left-back scared off making a rash challenge. Honeyman drills in a low ball but Derby are off the hook. 82 min: Andre Wisdom has just taken about 30 seconds to take a throw-in. He\u2019s having, er, some fun with the home supporters about it too. 80 min: Vaughan has not stopped tonight. He chases a lost cause, nabbing the ball from Wisdom and then McGeady shoots at goal. It\u2019s ambitious and off target, but Sunderland are still in the hunt for a second. 79 min: But it\u2019s straight into the wall by Vydra. Derby do win a corner out of it though. Huddlestone again delivers, with Johnson charging in to the box but Steele gathers. Sunderland supporters roar their team on \u2013 they want a winner. 78 min: N\u2019dong fouls Vydra, and there are a few handbags. Huddlestone\u2019s playing peacemaker, with Vydra himself stood over the ball 20 yards from goal ... 77 min: Martin off and Nugent on for Derby. Martin\u2019s lasting contribution was that miserable miss with just Steele to beat. 76 min: Vaughan appeals for a penalty but it\u2019s relatively half-hearted, although the Sunderland crowd do their bit to at least get the referee\u2019s attention. Oliver Langford\u2019s having none of it. 74 min: Sunderland look pretty knackered now while Derby seem to have a bit left in the tank. That means nothing yet though. 72 min: What a miss by Martin! He does brilliantly in the first place, laying it on for Vydra to take over the baton and charge towards goal. The Czech forward makes a lot of ground before side-footing the ball across to his team-mate, with only the goalkeeper to beat. Sadly, it ends up in Row L or so. A head in hands moment, and a huge chance wasted for Derby. 70 min: Grabban and Keogh share a joke after a little coming together close to the halfway line. Up the other end, Russell has a nothing shot blocked. 68 min: Vydra is proving a handful; he plays a neat one-two with Wisdom before Cattermole nicks it away for a Derby corner. It looks as though David Nugent could be next to come on, with Martin surely the most likely to make way. 66 min: Things have calmed down a little but perhaps both sides are just readying themselves for a frenetic finale. Let\u2019s hope so, anyway. Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest still lead 1-0 at the City Ground. 65 min: Weimann off and Vydra on for Derby. 62 min: Gary Rowett is getting Matej Vydra ready to come on. He\u2019s given him a little pep talk. Meanwhile, Kevin Phillips, first-team coach at Derby, is unsurprisingly getting plenty of love from the home supporters. 60 min: Johnson strikes again, but this time its wet and wild, and harmlessly over Steele\u2019s goal from distance. 59 min: Sunderland are knocking at the door. And John O\u2019Shea\u2019s warming up. I\u2019m not sure he is the answer just yet. 56 min: Grabban rattles the post! Bradley Johnson plays Curtis Davies into all kinds of trouble, allowing Cattermole to scurry in down the left, he then drives forwards before laying off the Sunderland striker. He smacks it goalwards and it cannons back off the post \u2013 so close for the hosts. Grabban was perhaps guilty of striking it too cleanly, with the ball coming straight back at him, via the woodwork. 55 min: Another Derby corner, another Huddlestone delivery. His set-pieces have caused a few problems this evening. 54 min: Now Derby are in the ascendency, before Chris Martin goes to ground in search of some medical attention. A replay of that earlier corner shows Kone \u2013 perhaps unfairly \u2013 grappling with Curtis Davies. The Derby defender has an argument for a penalty there. 53 min: Richard Keogh\u2019s header off the line! He meets Huddlestone\u2019s corner and Cattermole heads it away from danger. Browning was easily beaten to the ball by Keogh, who towered above him and planted a header goalwards. Both teams have gone close! 50 min: Grayson\u2019s barking out instructions on the touchline, with his players going through the gears on the pitch. Vaughan does superbly to keep the ball in play after Honeyman\u2019s Hollywood cross-field ball. Honeyman, a Sunderland player since the age of 10, asked a lot of his team-mate, but Vaughan kept it in, nudging the corner flag aside before picking out Grabban. He\u2019s certainly a willing runner. 49 min: Agonisingly wide by James Vaughan! He strikes his volley cleanly but it falls just millimetres wide of Carson\u2019s post. Grabban did well out on the left, unselfishly holding the ball up before McGeady\u2019s cross came bouncing into the box nicely for Vaughan. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s not found the net there. 47 min: Derby go straight up the other end and win a corner, as Jason Steele flaps at an effort. Weimann then tries to connect with Huddlestone\u2019s inswinging ball but fluffs his lines. Sunderland seek to calm things down, before whacking it back into the mixer as such. 46 min: It\u2019s a routine straight off the training ground as McGeady plays it into Grabban, who runs off and away from everybody else in the box. McGeady then gets it back and crosses but that\u2019s straight down Carson\u2019s throat. The second half gets underway with a bounce, as Sunderland win a free-kick 30 yards from goal. Half-time email: \u201cI thought the penalty was a bit harsh,\u201d says Steve. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good game so far.\u201d Agreed, although there was no complaints from Butterfield, who may feel aggrieved not to have won a penalty himself on the brink of half-time. The second half will be here shortly. A man in form? Lewis Grabban has now scored four goals in his last six Championship appearances, taking his loan stint at Reading (where he played in centre-midfield at times) last season into account. That\u2019s a wrap \u2013 for now. 45 min: Derby appeal for a penalty themselves, with Butterfield put under pressure by Cattermole as the midfielder breaks into the box. It looked a little dubious but Butterfield was seemingly given a nudge by the Sunderland skipper. 44 min: Derby win a free-kick down the left. Butterfield whips it in with his right boot, but Russell cannot send it goalwards. Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest have scored against Millwall, so it\u2019s 1-0 there at the City Ground. 43 min: Derby burst down the left flank as they restart proceedings, but Johnson\u2019s cross goes out for a goal-kick. That looked promising for a moment. Will we have any more drama before the break? He goes low and hard, to the goalkeeper\u2019s left. Carson is not far away from getting it, but it\u2019s there. Grayson punches the air! Penalty to Sunderland! Jacob Butterfield is the guilty party. It\u2019s handball as he goes to ground, and he has no complaints. 39 min: Forsyth curls in a deep cross but Galloway does well to ensure it doesn\u2019t reach Russell, lurking behind him at the back post. 38 min: The ball comes straight back at them, and Browning balloons it out of play: the dream scenario for Derby, who re-apply some more pressure on the Sunderland back line. 37 min: Russell is again in down the right flank but Sunderland get bodies back, doubling up on the Scotsman, with Kone ushering the Derby winger away from goal. Lovely stuff, and Sunderland whack it back upfield. 36 min: A crunching, but fair, Cattermole challenge on Wisdom helps Sunderland win the ball back. He limps away with the ball, nudges it in front of him before surging forward. Then comes Wisdom, back for round two, who upends the Sunderland captain. McGeady floats it in, and Grabban drives way over. 35 min: On the edge of the box, N\u2019dong gets a glimpse of goal and his eyes light up. Derby goal-kick. 34 min: Half a chance for Vaughan, played in by Cattermole inside the box but it deflects away for a goal-kick. He looks up for the fight, at least. 33 min: Lewis Grabban is a very lonely sole runner up front. He and James Vaughan are yet to strike up any real partnership. 30 min: Grayson, arms folded, looks like he\u2019s already had enough of this. Sunderland do though win another corner, with Vaughan poised for an overhead-kick (you can dream, I suppose) but Sunderland are wasteful in possession. Another foul is given, this time against N\u2019dong. 28 min: And Sunderland are conceding too many fouls. Derby\u2019s Butterfield floats in a free-kick but Steele claims that. 27 min: Sunderland are being geed up by captain Lee Cattermole. They\u2019re struggling to hold onto the ball. \u201cBottom of the Championship already,\u201d emails Bob Price. 26 min: The ball again drops kindly in the box for Sunderland but before Vaughan can make contact, Keogh hacks it away. This has been a decent response by Grayson\u2019s side. It does feel very cagey in the ground, though. 25 min: What a save by Carson! His half-volley from inside the box is palmed away for a corner by the Derby goalkeeper, after the ball fell at his feet, via Kone. Johnny Russell should count himself lucky. Sunderland then win another corner, with Vaughan getting the better of Forsyth. McGeady will take ... 23 min: Russell stupidly fouls Galloway, and Sunderland suddenly have a chance to whip it in from a tight angle down the left, close to the corner flag. 22 min: Huddlestone is a real authoritative presence in the Derby midfield. He\u2019s strutting around, and has had a big effect in both halves so far. His effort was brilliant, but it was beautifully, and unselfishly, chested into his path by Martin. 19 min: Crikey, Jason Steele is a very lucky man. Tyias Browning does well to save his goalkeeper from (further) embarrassment there, as he scoops up the ball after Steele had parried Huddlestone\u2019s first-time, long-range effort straight to Jacob Butterfield. A huge let-off. 18 min: McGeady has been lively too for Sunderland. He jinks down the left but he meets his match in Republic of Ireland team-mate Richard Keogh. He\u2019s having none of that. 17 min: Honeyman, in fairness, has been one of Sunderland\u2019s brightest sparks here. He wins a corner, before Billy Jones and Didier N\u2019dong combine to pen in Derby down the right flank. 15 min: The corner is poor and eventually lands at the feet of Forsyth, who can only shoot off target. Weimann then tries to play in Johnny Russell with an ambitious cross-field ball but its intercepted. Still, Derby have their tails up here. 14 min: Derby are enjoying themselves now, while Sunderland look a bag of nerves. Kone, dawdling on the ball, without any real danger, is urged to clear the ball by home supporters. And Derby win a corner after decent work by Wisdom down the right flank. 13 min: That was Derby\u2019s first real attack, and they made it count. \u201cWe are going up\u201d is the inevitable chant from some 1,700 or so delirious away supporters inside the Stadium of Light. 12 min: Johnny Russell easily beats his man, Galloway, then he surges inside, crosses low and Bradley Johnson is there to stab it home. He sticks his tongue out in delight. Derby had been really under the cosh - but a little slack defending, and Sunderland are behind. How Honeyman may come to rue that miscued chip over Carson. Derby go up the other end and score! 9 min: Derby are all over the place. On the other flank George Honeyman is away in behind the Rams defence, he tries to dink it over Carson but it\u2019s a pretty poor effort in truth. It ends up falling close to McGeady at an acute angle and Wisdom does superbly to snuff it out. Promising stuff for Sunderland. 7 min: Galloway makes in-roads down the left, with McGeady releasing the overlapping full-back, beating Andre Wisdom before drilling it across the box. Luckily for Derby, Huddlestone\u2019s there to cut it out. From the resulting corner, the Derby midfielder is again forced to clear, with Vaughan\u2019s presence causing problems. Rowett, legs crossed, frantically makes some notes. 6 min: Scott Carson will just be glad to get hold of the ball and calm things down for Derby. He, of course, then boots the ball downfield but Chris Martin is penalised for fouling Kone. 4 min: McGeady nicks the ball away from Russell, the crowd then roar him down the left flank but Wisdom cuts it out. Back to square one. Grabban and Vaughan are both dropping deep to pick up the ball. An energetic start if nothing else for Simon Grayson\u2019s side. 3 min: Derby, in luminous yellow, are on the back foot early on. Aiden McGeady is having a bit of joy up against Andre Wisdom. Brendan Galloway on the overlap is also a cause for concern. 2 min: Huddlestone gets himself into a spot of bother on the edge of the box but Russell helps him out. It was a quick burst by Lewis Grabban, the Bournemouth loanee, that caused a moment\u2019s panic. 1 min: James Vaughan wins an early free-kick down the left flank. It\u2019s floated in towards Vaughan but that\u2019s soon gobbled up by Carson. And just like, the new season is underway. Sunderland get things started. There\u2019s a rousing and touching minute\u2019s applause for Bradley Lowery. \u201cOne Bradley Lowery\u201d rings around the stadium. We are just a no-nonsense Ray Winstone betting ad away from kick-off ... More than 1,700 away fans have made the trip to the Stadium of Light. It\u2019s not jam-packed but the atmosphere is cranking up. There\u2019s the daunting Apprentice theme tune as the teams leave the tunnel, a combination of anticipation and nerves. Simon Grayson speaks about that up close and personal \u2018shit\u2019 video. \u201cDarron has apologised and he knows what he did was wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s happened, we\u2019ve put it to bed and if anything it can bring the group closer together.\u201d We\u2019ll find out shortly ... The teams are just wrapping up their warm-ups. Tom Huddlestone looks at ease back in Rams gear while Lamine Kon\u00e9 \u2013 who\u2019s seemingly intent on leaving the club \u2013 and Darron Gibson are all smiles. As they (relentlessly) say on Love Island, on paper, this Sunderland team looks pretty low on quality. Not that that means anything: Also in action tonight are Nottingham Forest, who host Millwall at the City Ground. Back at Sunderland, Wes Brown says the Black Cats have had big trouble attracting players to the club in the past. They do have a new set of shiny strikers on show tonight in James Vaughan and Lewis Grabban, though. The rest of the Football League are in action tomorrow: Team news news: six of Sunderland\u2019s new signings start at the Stadium of Light, with goalkeeper Robbin Ruiter only on the bench. Simon Grayson had said he felt the Dutchman was a little short of match fitness, so Jason Steele\u2019s in goal. For Derby, they finally have Chris Martin \u2013 who reported early for pre-season training \u2013 at their disposal for a competitive fixture after loaning him to Fulham last season. He leads the line. Sunderland: Steele; Jones, Kon\u00e9, Browning, Galloway; Honeyman, Cattermole, N\u2019dong, McGeady; Vaughan, Grabban Subs: Ruiter, O\u2019Shea, Asoro, Gibson, Matthews, Khazri, Gooch Derby County: Carson; Wisdom, Davies, Keogh, Forsyth; Russell, Huddlestone, Johnson, Butterfield, Weimann; Martin Subs: Mitchell, Bryson, Baird, Pearce, Bennett, Vydra, Nugent Can you believe it? The season starts here, on a Friday night in Sunderland. After an eventful pre-season, Simon Grayson\u2019s side host Derby County, who \u2013 despite being raided for their best players over the summer \u2013 look like they have ample quality to fight at the right end of the table. As for Sunderland, who knows? The numbers are not good: they were ripped apart 5-0 by Celtic just five days ago and have not won on the opening day since 2009, when Darren Bent came up with the goods at Bolton. There are seven new, fairly uninspiring arrivals and their best piece of business is seemingly Grayson himself. Only a handful of the players hammered by Chelsea on the final day of last season have survived, one of whom is Darron Gibson. Plus, who on earth\u2019s going to be in goal following the summer departures of Jordan Pickford and Vito Mannone? Dutch goalkeeper Robbin Ruiter has received international clearance to feature, but if not, it\u2019ll be Jason Steele. Elsewhere, Bryan Oviedo, Paddy McNair and Duncan Watmore are all missing, while Jack Rodwell could feature in some capacity. Derby manager Gary Rowett can call upon his own raft of summer signings: Tom Huddlestone \u2013 this his second coming for the Rams \u2013 Andre Wisdom and Curtis Davies. The defender, Richard Keogh, remains the Derby skipper, though. \u201cSunderland will want to lay down a marker for their home fans and get them onside for the coming campaign,\u201d he said. Let\u2019s see shall we? Kick-off: 7.45pm BST"
"7||Lewis Grabban earns Sunderland a home point against Derby CountySatisfactory is never the most thrilling assessment to take away from a match but Simon Grayson and Gary Rowett could depart the Stadium of Light feeling a point had been gained and, for Grayson in particular, a point had also been made. Last Saturday Grayson\u2019s new Sunderland had been beaten 5-0 at home by Celtic and were then lambasted by one of their own, Darron Gibson, in a drunken rant at a Durham hotel. Against an at times composed Derby marshalled by Tom Huddlestone, Sunderland set about disproving Gibson\u2019s theory with a spirt and energy that brought a buzz to the weathered stadium. There was a contrast with David Moyes\u2019s beginning and a contrast with his end. After a perky first 10 minutes in which George Honeyman, Aiden McGeady and Lewis Grabban could each have given Sunderland the lead in the same attack, Grayson watched as Bradley Johnson, a player he knows from Leeds, fired home for Derby. \u201cThe most important thing is we didn\u2019t crumble,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cPreviously this team might have gone under. We got on the front foot and asked questions of Derby.\u201d It was 11 minutes in and it was to be the most important moment of the match. Derby got their goal and Sunderland found a response. \u201cPeople have questioned the players\u2019 desire this week but what you saw was 11 players who chased every ball,\u201d Grayson added. \u201cTestament to that was the round of applause from the supporters.\u201d He said there is much work to be done before Sunderland are seen as some \u201chappy-go-lucky club\u201d and that this will be a \u201cslow process\u201d but there was a difference in mood at the Stadium of Light. Even Gibson, named on the bench, might have been impressed at the level of physical commitment shown by players such as the constant Lee Cattermole. Sunderland retain those unwanted statistics \u2013 no league win in the month of August since 2010, no home win in 2017 \u2013 but Grayson has something to build on. Ellis Short, the club\u2019s American owner, was present and he saw Grayson\u2019s first big decision \u2013 to narrow and shorten the pitch. \u201cWe felt they\u2019d be quite direct,\u201d Rowett said. \u201cWe saw they\u2019d made the pitch more compact. I think 1-1 probably flattered us at half-time but in the second half we were much better and I think we looked fitter than Sunderland.\u201d The focus on Sunderland\u2019s disarray \u2013 this week and last season \u2013 meant Derby\u2019s year of living carelessly was overshadowed. Twelve months ago they had promotion hopes and Nigel Pearson in charge. That soon gave way to Steve McClaren\u2019s return, then Rowett\u2019s arrival in March and Derby ended up 13 points off the play-offs. Since then they have lost Will Hughes but brought back Huddlestone to his first club. It was his ability to show some composure in midfield and spread a pass to the darting Johnny Russell that created the Derby goal. Russell nipped past Brendan Galloway, placed a cross through Lamine Kon\u00e9\u2019s legs and found Johnson six yards out. He made no mistake. Having won only two of the last 23 matches under Moyes, Sunderland fans could not expect their team to fight back but they revealed some attitude. Cattermiole had a 20th minute half-volley tipped over by Scott Carson and Grabban then hit a free shot over. There was a measure of good fortune about the equaliser. Four minutes before half-time, Jacob Butterfield stumbled awkwardly on the edge of the area and in falling, the ball hit his forearm. Sunderland claimed and Oliver Langford pointed to the spot. Grabban\u2019s kick was cool and beat Carson. That meant Grayson was a more reassured figure at the interval than he might have been. He then saw James Vaughan drag a shot inches wide four minutes into the second half and not long after Cattermole robbed Huddlestone in midfield, broke forward and slid a pass to Grabban. From 16 yards, he belted the ball off a post. Derby had attacks of their own, Cattermole cleared a Richard Keogh header off the line and Sunderland\u2019s overall feeling about the match would have been different had Chris Martin not fallen over on 73 minutes when free in the home area following a sharp run and pass from substitute Matej Vydra. Martin\u2019s slip meant no one lost and that mattered. McKay has Forest off to a flyer Barrie McKay\u2019s first goal for Nottingham Forest was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Mark Warburton\u2019s side at the City Ground but the Millwall manager, Neil Harris, will be wondering quite how. The summer signing from Rangers scored with a spectacular long-range shot four minutes before half-time but it was far from the game\u2019s only moment. Millwall had a host of chances but this was one of those matches where nothing went right for them. This was always going to be an awkward fixture for Forest \u2013 buoyed by the optimism stirred up by new owners and a new manager following Greek shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis\u2019 takeover \u2013 against a Millwall side who had battled their way out of League One. Fred Onyedinma summed up the game when he headed wide for Millwall in injury time."
"9||The Resistance Now: Trump's on vacay, so now's the time to actI know what you did ... and it is summer The sun is shining, Congress has packed up and Donald Trump has started his 17-day stint at his New Jersey golf resort. But the resistance doesn\u2019t do vacation. Indivisible and NextGen America have teamed up this summer to give activists an action plan. The progressive organizations say the recess for Congress is no reason for activists to take a break from holding their elected officials accountable. Both Indivisible and NextGen have created a series of videos showing actions progressives can take in August. Indivisible even has a specific section guiding people to events this month. \u201cAugust recess is constituents\u2019 biggest moment to demonstrate their power and make their voices heard,\u201d Leah Greenberg, Indivisible\u2019s co-executive director, told Teen Vogue. \u201cBy following the tips in these videos, constituents can make sure their members of Congress know that, no matter where they are, back home in the state or [in the] District, you\u2019re always there to hold them accountable,\u201d Greenberg added. Hannity ban-nity Activists are trying to push Fox News to fire host Sean Hannity for his promotion of a conspiracy theory about the recent death of Seth Rich, a Democratic National Committee staffer. Hannity has been heavily criticized for circulating a disproven theory that Rich, shot dead in Washington DC in July 2016, had provided DNC emails to WikiLeaks. And Hannity\u2019s resistance to facts has prompted the launch of firehannity.org by Democratic Coalition, a progressive group. The website makes it easy for activists to email, call and tweet about the companies advertising on Hannity\u2019s show \u2013 businesses including Alfa Romeo and Mercedes-Benz \u2013 and urge them to drop their spots. A similar strategy contributed to Fox News\u2019 April firing of Bill O\u2019Reilly in the wake of sexual harassment allegations. Sanders for kids Bernie Sanders has a new book coming out this month \u2013 a title that aims to educate youthful readers.

"6||Will Martin Shkreli's fraud conviction wipe the smirk off his face?When even Donald Trump thinks you look like a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d, you know you\u2019ve achieved something. Martin Shkreli possesses one of the most slappable faces in America and, over the last couple of years, he appears to have been doing his best to ensure everyone in America wants to slap it. On Friday, a Brooklyn jury did just that, and found the 34-year-old entrepreneur guilty of securities fraud. He now faces up to 20 years in prison, but is likely to get much less. In case you\u2019re not fully up to speed with how Shkreli, who is sometimes referred to as \u201cthe most hated man in America\u201d, came to be sitting federal trial for fraud, a brief recap. Shkreli was born to poor immigrant parents and worked his way into the highest echelons of corporate America. A precocious kid, he got a place at an elite New York high school then went on to set up a couple of hedge funds and, in 2011, a biotech company called Retrophin. In 2014, the story starts to veer from American dream into capitalist American nightmare. Shkreli was ousted by the board of Retrophin. The following year Retrophin filed a lawsuit against its former CEO, claiming, among other things, that Shkreli had misused company funds and harassed a former employee and his family. According to testimony at the trial, he wrote the employee\u2019s wife a letter saying: \u201cI hope to see you and your four children homeless \u2026 I will do whatever I can to assure this.\u201d Meanwhile, the US attorney\u2019s office started a criminal investigation into Shkreli. Faced with a lawsuit and a criminal investigation, some people might have put their head down and toed the line. Not Shkreli. In 2015, he founded another company: Turing Pharmaceuticals. He named it after Alan Turing, the genius British mathematician who was persecuted by the government for being gay \u2013 suggesting that perhaps, just perhaps, Shkreli might have something of a martyr complex. Just a few months after Turing\u2019s inception, it acquired the rights to a life-saving drug Daraprim and promptly raised the price of it by 5,500%. Outrage ensued, and Shkreli became the face of corporate greed in America. Faced with a lawsuit, a criminal investigation, and newly-minted pariah status, some people might have attempted to rehabilitate their image. Not Shkreli. Rather, Shkreli appeared to revel in his newfound infamy and was soon adding fuel to the fire. He trolled fans of the Wu-Tang Clan by buying the sole copy of one of their records for $2m. Then he got banned from Twitter for the \u201ctargeted harassment\u201d of Lauren Duca, a journalist. Shkreli photoshopped a picture of himself cuddling Duca and made it his Twitter profile, superimposing the words \u201c\u2018til death do us part\u201d. Harassing women. Shameless behavior on social media. A voracious thirst for the spotlight. An apparent disregard for basic propriety. Any of this remind you of someone? The president of the United States, perhaps? Shkreli is very much a younger, paler version of his idol, Trump. It seems apparent from Shkreli\u2019s behavior that he has modeled himself on the president, and is attempting to replicate the way in which Trump manufactures fame through a constant conveyor belt of controversy that makes irresistible content. Sometimes, Shkreli imitates Trump to the letter. Take, for example, the way in which Shkreli seesaws between presenting himself as being persecuted by the elite and reveling in his status in the elite. Last week, for example, Shkreli wrote on Facebook: \u201cMy case is a silly witch hunt perpetrated by self-serving prosecutors. Thankfully my amazing attorney sent them back to junior varsity where they belong. Drain the swamp. Drain the sewer that is the DoJ. MAGA.\u201d Shkreli\u2019s post very clearly echoed a tweet Trump sent in July defending his son Donald Jr against accusations of Russian collusion: \u201cYou are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA.\u201d All publicity is good publicity. Fame is a commodity that can be mined for fortune; it doesn\u2019t matter how you get it as long as you get it. You can\u2019t really punish someone like Shkreli by sending him to prison; that\u2019s just more fuel for a book or a movie about his life. No, you punish him by starving him of the oxygen of publicity. But that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Shkreli is a pharma bro who astutely realized that modern society is afflicted with an addiction to entertainment. He diagnosed the condition and then he turned himself into a drug to help feed it. The media are hooked now, and it\u2019s unlikely that this will be the last we hear about Shkreli. \u201cIn for comms director,\u201d Shkreli wrote on Facebook on Monday after news got out that Anthony Scaramucci had been fired. The way things are going, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Trump appoint Shkreli his new communications director next week."

"1||Laura Muir makes confident start in 1500m to her gruelling scheduleLaura Muir got her London 2017 campaign off to a sensible start and kept alive her hopes of winning a medal in both the 1500m and 5,000m. Fuelled by the instant porridge pots she carries everywhere, Muir jogged over the line to finish fourth in her 1500m heat in 4min 08.97sec. \u201cI just wanted to get through it and save as much energy as I could,\u201d she said. \u201cI stayed out of harm\u2019s way, so it\u2019s job done. It\u2019s great to get started because it feels like it\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d Muir, right, took the lead with two laps to go and looked strong down the home straight, as did the fast finishing Sifan Hassan of Holland. The Scotswoman\u2019s audacious double attempt entails running five races over 10 days. She will contest the 1500m semi-final on Saturday in a bid to make Monday\u2019s final. There will then be 72 hours before the heats of the 5,000m begin but Muir and her coach, Andy Young, have a meticulously planned recovery regime involving ice baths, compression socks and physiotherapy sessions. At present it is one down, four to go. The first heat was won by the world record holder Genzebe Dibaba in 4:02.67. The Ethiopian edged South Africa\u2019s Caster Semenya, who jogged over the line apparently with plenty in hand. The Olympic 800m champion Semenya surprised many by deciding to run over the longer distance as she has never broken four minutes but her easy qualification marked her out as a serious title contender. Debate continues to rage over the participation in these championships of Semenya, who has the condition hyperandrogenism, which causes naturally occurring but unusually high levels of testosterone in women. A study into hyperandrogenism, commissioned by the IAAF and published last month, reopened the debate on the issue and Semenya could be forced to undergo hormone replacement therapy if she wants to compete at future championships. Dibaba has had to weather her own controversy, too, after her former coach, Jama Aden, was arrested by Spanish police when vials of EPO were found in the hotel he was staying at in Spain last year. Both women overtook Jess Judd down the home straight after the Britain bravely took the race out. Judd managed to hold on to the final qualifying spot, crossing the line in a personal best of 4:03.73. Another Briton Laura Weightman, who is coached by Steve Cram, also qualified for the semi-finals, finishing fifth in her heat in 4:03.50. Sarah McDonald finished ninth in hers but qualified as a fastest loser, which meant all four Britons were through to the semi-finals."
"1||England could lose Ottis Gibson as South Africa target bowling coachEngland are bracing themselves for the departure of their bowling coach, Ottis Gibson, with the former West Indies and Durham seamer having emerged as the leading candidate to become the new head coach of current opponents South Africa. Russell Domingo, the incumbent, has had to reapply for his position after four years in charge but it is understood Gibson is considered the frontrunner. England would be reluctant for the 48-year-old to leave the set-up and an announcement is expected at the end of the series. Gibson is currently in his second spell working with England\u2019s seamers since rejoining the coaching staff under Peter Moores in 2015 after a spell in charge of West Indies and his going would leave a considerable dent in their plans before this winter\u2019s Ashes series. Speaking after the first day of the Old Trafford Test, the England assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, said: \u201cOttis is someone with a lot of international experience. He did a great job for West Indies, winning the World Twenty20 in 2012. We wouldn\u2019t want to lose him. He has done a great job for England but at the moment Russell Domingo is head coach of South Africa and doing a brilliant job, so it would be disrespectful of us to talk about his position. We have had nothing official and hopefully it will be left for the end of the series.\u201d The Guardian understands Gibson is torn over the decision, with the money on offer from South Africa double that of his current England salary and South Africa a country he enjoyed living in during his playing days at Gauteng and Border. Andrew Strauss, the director of cricket, may yet be able to persuade him to remain in situ with an increased counter offer. News of the approach for Gibson came on an absorbing first day at Old Trafford, where England lost Ben Stokes for 58 late in the day to close on 260 for six. Farbrace said: \u201cThe last five minutes we\u2019ll be disappointed with. Had Ben still been there we would say it was a decent day. \u201cThis morning was tough. The first two hours we could have lost more than one wicket but it showed guts, skill and some luck to go into lunch one down. The good thing is if you bat first, you have shown intent to take control of the game.\u201d Joe Root had earlier passed 5,000 runs but his removal for 52, lbw to Duanne Olivier, proved a source of frustration for the England captain, even though he had equalled John Edrich\u2019s national record of half-centuries or more in 10 successive Tests. Farbrace added: \u201cWe will take 50 every time \u2013 that\u2019s not a bad average \u2013 but he will be disappointed to get out that way because he prides himself on going big. That is what drives him to be what he is and 5,000 Test runs are testimony to a high-quality player that seems to be getting better and better with every series he plays.\u201d"
"9||Federal court overturns former Blackwater guard's murder convictionA federal appeals court has overturned the first-degree murder conviction of a former Blackwater security contractor and ordered a new trial for the man who prosecutors said fired the first shots in the 2007 killing of 14 Iraqi civilians at a crowded traffic circle in Baghdad. In a split opinion issued on Friday, the three-judge panel of the US court of appeals for the DC circuit ruled that a court erred in 2014 by not allowing Nicholas Slatten to be tried separately from his co-defendants, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard. Slatten, a 33-year-old contractor from Tennessee who was the sniper on a team protecting state department officials, is serving a life sentence. During his trial, prosecutors said he saw killing Iraqis as \u201cpayback for 9/11\u201d. No connection between Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraqi regime and the 9/11 attacks has been proven. The Washington appeals panel also ordered new sentences for Slough, Liberty and Heard, who were found guilty of 13 charges of voluntary manslaughter and 17 charges of attempted manslaughter and sentenced to 30 years each. The judges determined those sentences violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because prosecutors charged them with using military firearms while committing another felony. That statute, typically employed against gang members or bank robbers, had never been used against overseas security contractors working for the US government. The lawyers for the defendants could not immediately be reached for comment. Fourteen people died and at least 17 were wounded in the incident in Nisour Square in Baghdad, which strained international relations and drew scrutiny of the role of American contractors in the Iraq war. The government described the killings as a one-sided ambush of unarmed civilians, while the defense said the guards had opened fire only after a white Kia sedan seen as a potential car bomb began moving quickly toward their convoy. After the shooting stopped, no evidence of a bomb was found. In issuing their ruling benefiting the defendants, the judges said they were in no way excusing the horror of events they said \u201cdef[y] civilized description\u201d. \u201cIn reaching this conclusion, we by no means intend to minimize the carnage attributable to Slough, Heard and Liberty\u2019s actions,\u201d said the US circuit Judge Karen L Henderson, writing for the court. \u201cTheir poor judgments resulted in the deaths of many innocent people.\u201d In a sentencing memorandum filed in April 2015, the government said: \u201cNone of the victims was an insurgent, or posed any threat to the Raven 23 convoy.\u201d In the same memorandum, David Boslego, a retired US army colonel, called the massacre \u201ca grossly excessive use of force \u2026 grossly inappropriate for an entity whose only job was to provide personal protection to somebody in an armored vehicle\u201d. Blackwater, which is based in North Carolina, is now known as Academi, having previously been sold and renamed as Xe Services. Its founder, Erik Prince, is the brother of the current US education secretary, Betsy DeVos. He is no longer attached to the company."
"11||Despacito becomes most-viewed video in YouTube historyThe music video for smash hit single Despacito, from Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, has become the most-watched YouTube video ever, surpassing the record for Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth\u2019s See You Again. With just under 3bn views, only a couple more million than Khalifa\u2019s work scored, Despacito continues its run as the song of the summer, having spent the past 12 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. When the song whose title means \u201cslowly\u201d in English initially went to number one in May, it was the first Spanish-language song to reach that position since Macarena did in 1996. Khalifa and Puth had little time to enjoy See You Again\u2019s being YouTube\u2019s most-viewed video ever last month. After it dethroned Psy\u2019s 2012 song Gangnam Style, Despacito knocked off See You Again from the top spot two weeks later and now averages about 15m new views a week as it dominates airwaves. While the music video for Despacito, which was filmed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, does not feature Justin Bieber, his presence on the single has helped its steady rise to the top. It achieved this record in a mere seven months (after premiering in January) while See You Again, from Furious 7, was uploaded two years ago. Daddy Yankee took to Billboard\u2019s Instagram account to post a video responding to the honor of being the new king of YouTube. \u201cThank you YouTube for Despacito\u2019s success,\u201d he says in the clip. \u201cI recognize the influence that the platform has. The music industry has changed. The rules of music have changed. And YouTube has a big responsibility, and I recognize it. Breaking the record is overwhelming, and I\u2019m happy to keep [inspiring] others to do the same.\u201d In June his video also became the most-streamed song of all time with 4.6bn listens while last month Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro tried to co-opt the song for his campaign with an unofficial remix. Both Fonsi and Yankee criticized its usage for \u201cnefarious\u201d reasons. Bieber, who\u2019s featured in the song\u2019s remix, recently cancelled the remainder of his Purpose tour, explaining in an Instagram post that he wants his \u201cmind, heart, and soul to be sustainable\u201d."
"9||Martin Shkreli found guilty of fraud by jury in New YorkMartin Shkreli, the hedge fund manager turned pharmaceutical entrepreneur once dubbed \u201cthe most hated man in America\u201d, has been found guilty on three of eight federal charges that he deceived investors in a pair of failed hedge funds. The jury of seven women and five men reached their verdict on the fifth day of deliberations after a month-long federal fraud trial. Shkreli, nicknamed \u201cPharma Bro\u201d for his willfully provocative behaviour, faced up to 20 years behind bars on the charges of securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Shkreli, 34, was convicted of two counts of securities fraud relating to charges that he lied to investors while sweet-talking them into pumping more capital into his failing hedge funds, and one count of conspiracy. But he was cleared of defrauding Retrophin, his former biotech company, which he was accused of illegally raiding for assets to reimburse skeptical investors who wanted their money back. Speaking outside federal court in Brooklyn on Friday afternoon, Shkreli said: \u201cWhen you have the entire federal government on you \u2026 it\u2019s a scary thing, it\u2019s daunting to have that weight on your shoulders, and standing up to them and telling them I don\u2019t think you have your facts right. We fought back and we feel like we won.\u201d He claimed to have been cleared on \u201cthe most important charges\u201d US district judge Kiyo Matsumoto allowed Shkreli to remain free on $5m bail and a date for sentencing has not been set. \u201cI wish you well, Mr Shkreli, see you soon,\u201d she said. The judge had ordered Shkreli to stop talking to the press during the trial. She also told opposing lawyers they were arguing \u201clike children.\u201d His lawyer Benjamin Brafman said that he would argue strongly on appeal that his client did not deserve a custodial sentence. \u201cI think we are smiling, even though it was not the clean sweep we would have preferred,\u201d Brafman said of the non-guilty verdicts on a majority of the charges. \u201cI think some of these counts are hanging by a thread and my hope is that at the end of the appellate process there is no prison time for Martin.\u201d Prosecutors had told the jury that Shkreli told \u201clies upon lies\u201d, from where he went to university to the health of his business. He had boasted he had $40m in hedge funds that only had about $300 in the bank, assistant US attorney Alixandra Smith said in closing arguments. Prior to the trial, Shkreli boasted he would be acquitted entirely because he was \u201cso innocent\u201d and jurors would apologize to him. Shkreli also faces a heap of civil lawsuits. Shkreli achieved notoriety in 2015 after the 34-year-old increased the price of a life-saving drug, Daraprim, used by people with Aids and others suffering from toxoplasmosis, by 5,000% overnight, shortly after his pharmaceutical startup bought the commercial rights to it. The move led to BBC calling him America\u2019s most hated man. Even Donald Trump weighed in, calling Shkreli a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d and his business practices \u201cdisgusting\u201d. Seeming to revel in his notoriety, Shkreli doubled down, telling the Guardian: \u201cThere are very few people who care about toxoplasmosis more than me.\u201d He reinforced his notoriety with a troll-like internet presence, especially towards female journalists and celebrities. But the drug pricing scandal is not the reason Shkreli was on trial. He was arrested in December 2015 in an early-morning raid and led away in handcuffs, accused of lying to investors after making poor bets on the stock market via his hedge funds and then illegally paying people back in cash and stock from pharmaceutical businesses he had created. According to prosecutors, he was running a form of pyramid, or Ponzi, scheme. Shkreli\u2019s provocative posturing was on full display during his four weeks of testimony in July, 2017, at his trial in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. He was barred from Twitter after harassing a female reporter but appears to have come back with several aliases. The latest, @SamTheManTP, appeared irritated with delay in the verdict, tweeting: \u201cCmon gimme dat verdict\u201d, and \u201cYeah I\u2019m innocent stupid.\u201d On Thursday, @SamTheManTP tweeted: \u201cTrump has been flawless since election. Not one mistake made, pretty amazing. #flawless\u201d At the trial, Brafman, who successfully defended former International Monetary Fund boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a sexual assault case, claimed Shkreli merely made some honest mistakes and was doing business with the best of intentions. His client was \u201ca genius\u201d who reimbursed his investors and made many of them very rich. Presenting Shkreli\u2019s defense in court, Brafman tried to humanize his client. While attending Hunter College High in New York \u2013 a school for intellectually gifted children \u2013 his client was bullied and was known for being nerdy and extremely socially awkward, and had a tendency to be manipulated, said Brafman. One trial witness last month, Schuyler Marshall, a Dallas-based real estate company chairman who invested in one of Shkreli\u2019s later hedge funds, said that Shkreli reminded him of the film character Rain Man, the autistic savant played by Dustin Hoffman, who has extraordinary mathematical powers but difficulty relating to others. Under cross-examination, Marshall said that he was not claiming Shkreli was autistic, but that: \u201cThe reference here was that this was just an intensely focused, bright guy who knew his stuff.\u201d Jurors also heard that a former employee, Caroline Stewart, chatting online with a co-worker in 2011, said Shkreli was mentally unstable and a scam artist, who kept deceiving her over money he owed her and was lying repeatedly to investors, employees and investigators. \u201cI\u2019m done trusting Martin, I can\u2019t believe a word that comes out of his mouth,\u201d the court heard she wrote of Shkreli. \u201cWhat do you say to a guy who shoots off at the mouth and has no intention of delivering? He\u2019s a scam artist. I can\u2019t deal with somebody who lies all the time.\u201d Shkreli\u2019s self-image as a genius investor has also taken a beating at the trial. The two other hedge funds and a pharmaceutical company called Retrophin he created all spiraled towards collapse. After making risky bets of the markets Shkreli risked ruin and, in December 2012, was down to his last $1,415, according to the New York Times. In a burst of frenetic communications with investors, employees and advisers, he managed to raise fresh capital for Retrophin and save it from the brink. He was later ousted from Retrophin. Now a public company, it has since achieved financial success, and some of his earlier investors who were being given the runaround by Shkreli made huge profits because he gave them Retrophin stock. Prosecutors argued Shkreli illegally used Retrophin assets to pay back the investors from his busted hedge funds. After leaving Retrophin, he started another biotech company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, and it was this firm that bought the rights to the drug Daraprim in August 2015, hiking the price and making headlines in September 2015. He was later forced out of that company, too. While always having plenty to say online, Shkreli refused to testify at a congressional hearing on drug pricing in 2016, deploying little more than his smirk."
"1||Deja vu for Keaton Jennings as Haseeb Hameed waits in the wingsThe timing may have been purely coincidental but as Keaton Jennings trudged back to the dressing room stairs at Old Trafford on Friday with 17 to his name, and Haseeb Hameed began a net session with the England coaches, it was hard not to ponder whether the pair will be trading places come the first Test with West Indies in a fortnight\u2019s time. Jennings is the latest in a long line of England openers to find their summer turn into something of a saga and still has one innings remaining in this match at least. But since earning his chance last winter through Hameed\u2019s broken hand and starring on debut with a century in Mumbai, the theme of this first home season has not been one of permanence. Here in Manchester the 25-year-old left-hander with the sunny disposition appeared to have caught a break. Vernon Philander, whose nibbling style of seam bowling has had his number three times to date, was out of the match with back spasms. South Africa still cut their seamers by one. Joe Root won the toss. A chance was there to be taken. It was always going to require some fortune against the new ball under early overcast skies, as demonstrated by Alastair Cook playing and missing three times in the first over. And Jennings indeed got a reprieve on four, with Kagiso Rabada failing to hold a diving caught and bowled in the second over that the curiously absent short leg would have gobbled up. But just when Jennings had started to cut loose a touch with a couple of crunched fours through the covers, the seamer called up by the tourists, Duanne Olivier, gave his best recreation of Philander\u2019s past exploits by teasing an edge from a tentative defensive shot that Quinton de Kock gleefully held off his old school chum. \u201cHe\u2019s found out a lot about himself in these last few Tests, there\u2019s absolutely no doubt,\u201d the England assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, said after stumps. \u201cAnd there\u2019s areas of his game he would want to work on but there hasn\u2019t been time to perhaps take a step back and address a couple things that would enable him to be more successful in Test cricket. \u201cHe\u2019s a very honest young man who works extremely hard on his game and given the chance to get through this spell he can make a success of international cricket. When you have someone who is honest and driven you want to stick with them.\u201d But as Jennings departed with a sense of deja vu and an average of 15.57 this series \u2013 albeit with a slightly more philosophical outlook than the bat-slamming antics of Dawid Malan witnessed on the stroke of tea \u2013 Hameed was just beginning his drills with the England batting coach, Mark Ramprakash, and a small audience of cheery supporters for company. It is hard to work out how much of a stalking horse Hameed is to Jennings at present, not least with Surrey\u2019s in-form Mark Stoneman having twice come close to selection this summer. Hameed\u2019s spell taking throw-downs from Ramprakash \u2013 one that saw his middle stump pegged back early in the piece and prompted some lighthearted ribbing from the onlookers \u2013 was in part due to location but there is little doubt the England management view the 20-year-old as their best long-term bet for a position that has become a five-year revolving door. Was his presence at Old Trafford fair on the incumbent playing for his place? Farbrace replied: \u201cIt\u2019s just another opportunity to keep [Hameed] in the fold and make him realise he\u2019s very much part of the future of the England cricket team. We want him to score runs and hopefully push to get back into the team at some point. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the England team there should always be someone knocking on the door for you place. So whether they\u2019re here at the ground or whether they\u2019re doing it in county cricket, they\u2019re there. That\u2019s the idea, you bring people along, you want them to be part of it and if it puts pressure on all well and good.\u201d Farbrace said the selectors will be keeping an eye on Lancashire\u2019s game against Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl from Sunday , as the County Championship briefly pops up its head in the mid-summer Twenty20 block, and a sizeable score for Hameed would be timely for a batsman whose demonstration of talent and character in India was followed by a string of low returns on his return to domestic action. But it would also see England enter the same perilous territory that handed Gary Ballance a return last season on the back of one century, rather than a string of consistent returns, and expose an otherwise out of form player to international attacks. Hameed is an asset they will be even more wary of damaging. West Indies, however, may be considered a soft re-entry for Hameed even with the slight element of the unknown that comes with the first Test being a day-night affair. If Jennings bounces back in the second innings \u2013 a call to his Durham captain and some-time drinker in the last chance saloon, Paul Collingwood, might be an idea \u2013 then it will all become moot. South Africa may be without Philander this Test but their bowlers, who are one light in number with the extra batsman preferred, put in a shift. Keshav Maharaj may have largely escaped the headlines this series but played a crucial hand for Faf du Plessis by stopping Cook in his tracks for 46 and ending the day with one for a thrifty 54 from his 29 overs. The Proteas do not have a rich heritage of spin bowlers. Hugh Tayfield is their lead protagonist with 170 wickets in the 1950s, while since readmission only three men \u2013 Paul Adams, Paul Harris and Nicky Boje \u2013 have ventured into triple-figures. Maharaj, 27, has 41 victims from 11 Tests and the simple, repeatable action that delivers such unwavering accuracy makes him a fair bet to one day top the lot."
"8||People who carry out \u2018life-changing\u2019 acid attacks face life sentencesCriminals caught with acid can expect to receive the same prison sentences as those convicted of carrying a knife, according to new judicial guidelines that have come into effect. Life sentences could be handed down to those who carry out \u201clife-changing\u201d acid attacks, even if they miss their target or fail to inflict serious harm on their victim. Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, said there was a strong public interest in authorising the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to prosecute acid attackers. \u201cYou can\u2019t just expect to carry acid around without an excuse. It counts as an offensive weapon just as much as a knife or a screwdriver could be,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are very conscious of the impact of this crime and how there has been a recent spate of it so we are very keen to make sure that we do prosecute it and the court has the right sentencing powers.\u201d Public concern has been mounting in London after a spate of acid attacks, some of which have caused serious injuries and disfigurement. The number of crimes using acid or other \u201cnoxious substances\u201d has more than doubled in London over the last three years, according to official data. There have also been notable increases in other parts of England. In the capital, the number of incidents rose from 186 between April 2014 and March 2015 to 397 in the same period in 2016-17. Corrosive chemicals have been used in robberies, gang violence and unprovoked attacks. Moped riders have expressed particular concern after delivery riders were targeted by acid attackers for their vehicles. Critics have said rules on possessing acid are too lax and have called for them to be strengthened. Saunders told the London Evening Standard: \u201cWe are recognising that there\u2019s been an increase in this type of crime, we are recognising the serious nature of it, the impact it can have on individuals who suffer from having corrosive fluids or acid sprayed at them, which can be life-changing.\u201d Prosecutions needed to act as a deterrent, she added. People carrying acid would be treated as if they were carrying an offensive weapon, which carries a maximum four-year sentence. Life sentences will be given to those who carry out acid attacks, even if they miss their target or their victim escapes serious injury, Saunders said. \u201cWe are giving the courts the widest possible sentencing power they could possibly want, which is up to life,\u201d she said. A CPS spokesperson said on Friday: \u201cThe CPS has today published interim guidance for prosecutors on the appropriate handling of cases involving acid attacks. \u201cThis follows the home secretary\u2019s announcement on 16 July and covers the appropriate charges and public interest considerations in such cases. \u201cThis will form part of the wider review of guidance on offensive weapons, knives, bladed and pointed articles, and the offences against the person charging standard that was already under way.\u201d In July, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, announced an action plan on \u201chorrific\u201d acid attacks, which called on the CPS to review its sentencing for offenders. She also said the Poisons Act 1972 would be reviewed to ensure it covered enough chemicals and noxious substances."
"12||Game of Thrones episode leaked online after HBO suffers week of chaosThe cable network HBO capped off several weeks of controversy and misfortune with further bad news on Friday when it emerged that the next episode of its star series, Game of Thrones, due to air on Sunday, had leaked on the internet that morning. The online airing of the episode, in low-quality format, was apparently separate from the hack attack earlier in the week in which the episode\u2019s script leaked after hackers breached HBO\u2019s servers. The mishap came amid continuing rows over HBO\u2019s announcement that it is planning a drama series titled Confederate, set in the deep south, which imagines what America would have been like if the outcome of the civil war had been different and slavery had remained legal. The Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB White teamed up to write Confederate, which they originally envisioned as a feature film but then decided to serialize on television instead. The announcement marked a sharp sociopolitical contrast with Amazon\u2019s revelation that it was also planning a post-civil war fiction series \u2013 one that imagines what might have happened if freed slaves had been given control of three southern states as reparations and turned the territory into a sovereign country, called New Colonia. The leak of this Sunday\u2019s Game of Thrones episode, the fourth in the current seventh season of the smash-hit show, which kicked off in July, came through the channel\u2019s Indian distribution partner, Star India, the distributor confirmed to the Verge. \u201cWe take this breach very seriously and have immediately initiated forensic investigations at our and the technology partner\u2019s end to swiftly determine the cause. This is a grave issue and we are taking appropriate legal remedial action,\u201d a Star India spokesperson said. Game of Thrones has been hit by leaks and pirating in prior seasons, with unauthorized files being downloaded and shared millions of times. Not long after episode three in the latest season of Game of Thrones aired last Sunday, reports sprung up that HBO had been the target of a major hacking incident, in which the following week\u2019s script and advance episodes of other shows, including Ballers and Room 104, had been stolen. Some journalists received emails last Sunday night, written in somewhat halting English, announcing \u201cthe greatest leak of cyber space era is happening\u201d and urging the media to spread the word. The message ended: \u201cWhoever spreads well, we will have an interview with him. HBO is falling.\u201d HBO condemned the breach as disruptive, unsettling and disturbing and said the authorities were investigating. On Friday, postings of the forthcoming episode itself turned up in a Reddit thread, in contrast with the earlier hacks, which only involved script material. HBO had stopped the normal practice of sending out advance review screeners in the build-up to the latest season of Game of Thrones, in an effort to protect its content, but the channel was unable to prevent a week of security breaches. The kerfuffle comes on the heels of a swelling grassroots campaign on social media to sink the Confederate project before it films and is expected to air in 2018, while others urged a wait-and-see approach."
"1||England fail to capitalise on starts and lose Ben Stokes late in the dayWith substantial rather than decisive contributions from the old guard \u2013 Alastair Cook, Joe Root and Ben Stokes (yes, he can just about be included in this category now) \u2013 England tiptoed towards a serviceable total in the final Test of the series, but no more than that. This trio scored 46, 52 and 58 respectively as England finished an absorbing day on 260 for six. Yet South Africa were able to leave the field with a smile. They were boosted by the late dismissal of Stokes just before the close and the knowledge that they had hung in there with a depleted attack. Several times England were on the verge of domination, whereupon another wicket fell. The simple fact is that this England team is far from formidable at present since three of their top five are searching \u2013 with varying degrees of success \u2013 for ways to leap over the initial barriers that Test cricket presents. The obstacles have several threads: better bowlers, greater scrutiny, which leads to a far more pressurised environment than is experienced in domestic cricket. The newcomers all made a start, supposedly the hard bit, but they could muster only 64 runs between them. Dawid Malan demonstrated his frustration most obviously by banging his bat into the turf just after he edged Morne Morkel\u2019s last ball before tea to second slip. Tom Westley, the most impressive of the new boys, remained self-composed after nicking a fine delivery from Kagiso Rabada. Likewise Keaton Jennings departed decorously when dismissed by Duanne Olivier just before noon but he must have been crestfallen. One day the cameraman who pokes his implement at the departing batsman\u2019s nose while invading his personal space will get an almighty thump \u2013 and not much sympathy. Of this trio Jennings must be the most desperate for runs in the second innings to keep his place in the team. Seldom has there been such a gulf within a Test batting lineup between the newcomers and the established; in fact, it is unusual to have so many novices feeling their way simultaneously. Cook and Root, albeit with their contrasting virtues, are among the best players of their generation. Stokes may well have the capacity to join that elite. But Jennings, Westley and Malan are just dipping their toes in the water. Early on it was tricky whether the batsman had 144 matches under his belt like Cook or six like Jennings. The dark brown hue of the pitch suggested moisture, though not enough to deter Root from choosing to bat, and there was movement for South Africa\u2019s pace bowlers. Unfortunately for Faf du Plessis these did not include Vernon Philander, infuriatingly suffering from back spasms, a condition which also afflicted Chris Morris. Nonetheless Morkel and Rabada are not a bad pairing and in his first over alone Morkel beat Cook\u2019s bat three times. There was sufficient lateral movement to make batting a trial. On four, Jennings pushed forward and a bat/pad catch looped enticingly in the air. A forward short leg could have strolled to his right to take the catch but there was no one there. Instead Rabada bounded forward and dived but the ball bobbled out of his hands. Jennings hit two crisp off-side boundaries but could not make much of this escape. On 17 a straightforward edge from a stiff defensive stroke ended up in Quinton de Kock\u2019s gloves. Now the Essex boys battled away; the bowlers maintained a full length so they were seldom on the pull. Westley left the ball expertly and in the last half an hour before lunch Du Plessis, as if sensing a long day ahead, employed both Keshav Maharaj, his fast-improving spinner, and Theunis de Bruyn, the dibbly-dobbliest of seamers. For England it was a bonus to lose just one wicket in the session. South Africa contrived three wickets in the afternoon. Maharaj, who would occupy the Brian Statham End all afternoon and most of the evening, had Cook caught behind for 46. After all that graft in taxing conditions this must have been an exasperating dismissal. In the next over Westley edged and De Kock, diving to his right, held a brilliant one-handed catch. Next into the unforgiving examination chamber came Malan. While Root proceeded watchfully by his standards but seldom missed out on a scoring opportunity, progress was painfully slow for Malan as he sought to assert himself at this level. There was a leg glance and a neat cover drive to the boundary but no stepping up from the foothills of Test cricket. After tea Root reached a landmark even though he scored only 52: he became the fifth fastest Englishman to 5,000 Test runs. This modest statistic is a sound indicator of Root\u2019s quality as a Test batsman since the other four (with the fastest to 5,000 first) are as follows: Jack Hobbs, Wally Hammond, Ken Barrington and Len Hutton. It is also a sign of a damned good player when there is frustration that he seems to get out too frequently between 50 and 100. However, Root\u2019s was a poor dismissal; he was lbw to Olivier, a bowler who declines to tuck his shirt in (how many of the great ones have done that?). The ball was full and straight and Root tried to whip it to the leg side. But he missed it. In his disgust he opted for an ill-conceived, futile review. Jonny Bairstow almost followed soon after. On four he edged a ball on to his pad off Maharaj and it ended up in Dean Elgar\u2019s hands at slip (after an initial appeal for lbw). It was one of those that looked out to the naked eye but once it was referred to the third umpire the doubts surfaced as to whether it was a clean catch. Then Bairstow added 65 alongside Stokes, who may have been contemplating some mayhem in the morning when his stumps were splattered by a brilliant Rabada yorker in the penultimate over. Curiously Toby Roland-Jones came in as a nightwatchman so Moeen will be batting nine, one of the few batting positions he has yet to experience."
"8||Venezuela crisis: loyalist assembly inaugurated amid Vatican criticismThe threat of confrontation mounted in Venezuela as president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, installed a controversial new assembly despite overwhelming international condemnation and a planned opposition protest. The Vatican became the latest of dozens of states to reject the new assembly, which it said \u201ccreate[s] a climate of tension and conflict\u201d in the overwhelmingly Catholic country. Despite the Vatican\u2019s strongly worded statement, a Catholic priest gave his blessing at the inauguration on Friday of the body, which will have the power to rewrite the constitution and dissolve state institutions. The former foreign minister Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who was named the assembly\u2019s president, declared that the body rejected \u201cforeign interference\u201d in Venezuela. The 545-member body is made up entirely of pro-government loyalists after the opposition boycotted last Sunday\u2019s vote as an unconstitutional attempt by Maduro to strengthen his grip on power. The vote has also come under question amid allegations of fraud and vote rigging, which election officials and the government have rejected as part of an international campaign to attack the president. In an us-against-them themed speech, Rodriguez said \u201cviolent fascists who are waging economic war on the people\u201d would face justice. \u201cPresident Maduro: we are not going to leave you alone,\u201d Rodriguez said before the assembly members, some dressed in the colorful outfits of Venezuela\u2019s indigenous tribes. Adding to already high tensions, the new super-body hold sessions in a chamber of the Legislative Palace in Caracas, where the opposition-controlled parliament normally convenes. The opposition coalition, known by its Spanish initials as MUD, has called for critics of the government to march in the capital, heightening the probability of violent clashes between protesters and security forces. More than 125 people have been killed in four months of protests against Maduro\u2019s government, which the opposition sees as increasingly authoritarian and repressive. More than 5,000 people have been detained by security forces, and 1,389 remain in custody, according to Foro Penal, a human rights group. Hundreds of civilian protesters have been put on trial in military courts \u2013 a practice denounced on Friday by a group of United Nations experts. \u201cThe government of Venezuela must stop systematically detaining protesters and end the growing use of military tribunals to try civilians,\u201d the group of five experts said in a statement. The Vatican \u2013 which has previously acted as a mediator between the government and opposition \u2013 also appealed on Friday for Venezuelan security forces to show restraint. Maduro has said the assembly will strip opposition lawmakers of their constitutional immunity from prosecution, while members of congress say they will only be removed by force. \u201cWe will go out and take the streets to fight for freedom,\u201d said Julio Borges, head of the national assembly, the country\u2019s unicameral parliament, where the opposition won control in 2015 elections after it was run for years by the ruling Socialist party. \u201cWe will not stop until we achieve it,\u201d he said. On Friday, government loyalists marched to the Capitol building with portraits of Ch\u00e1vez, whose images we removed from parliament when the opposition won control. In a surprise reversal, security forces transferred the Caracas mayor, Antonio Ledezma, from jail to house arrest, just days after they whisked him out of his home in his pyjamas in a midnight raid. \u201cSeveral minutes ago, Antonio was unexpectedly returned by the Sebin [intelligence agency] to our home,\u201d Ledezma\u2019s wife, Mitzy Capriles de Ledezma, wrote on her husband\u2019s Twitter account. \u201cWe thank the people of Venezuela and the international community for their concern and solidarity.\u201d Another opposition figure, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, also taken on Tuesday from his home, apparently remains in prison. His wife, Lilian Tintori, said his lawyers had not been allowed to see him. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how he is,\u201d she tweeted on Thursday. Maduro was chosen by his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, to continue Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s socialist policies after the former leader\u2019s death in 2013. Maduro has presided over the oil-rich country\u2019s worst economic and political crisis in recent history. He has said the country is the victim of an economic war led by the \u201cinternational right wing\u201d while the opposition blames Venezuela\u2019s misfortunes on poor management and rampant corruption. Last week, the US imposed targeted sanctions on Maduro \u2013 whom Trump has called a \u201cdictator\u201d \u2013 and more than a dozen of his close allies, freezing any US assets they might have. Although the sanctions are not meant to affect the Venezuelan people, the economist and pollster Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n warned that the effects of the political instability would hit the average citizen hard. \u201cTimes of never-before-seen scarcity are coming,\u201d he said in a statement in which he called on Venezuelans to prepare. The country\u2019s currency, the bolivar, lost more than 17% of its value against the dollar on Thursday, placing scarce imported food and medicine further out of reach for many Venezuelans. More than 40 countries have said they will not recognize the assembly. On the eve of its installation, the Spanish embassy in Caracas was attacked with petrol bombs. Prosecutors said two individuals on a motorcycle launched the devices, which started a fire but caused no reported injuries. Spain has been pressing the EU to impose sanctions on Venezuela but the European bloc has so far held off, although it condemned the assembly election. The opposition has consistently called the vote a fraud, and it was backed up by Smartmatic, a British-based company involved in the vote technology behind the election last Sunday, which sad that \u201cwithout a doubt\u201d the official turnout figure had been tampered with and exaggerated by at least a million voters. The attorney general, Luisa Ortega \u2013 once loyal to the government, but now one of Maduro\u2019s most high-profile critics \u2013 ordered an investigation, saying prosecutors had lodged court cases seeking to have the constituent assembly annulled, though few in Venezuela believed that would be achieved."
"1||Tom Brady: my concussion history isn't anybody's businessThe day after he turned 40 \u2013 and with no end to his career in a dangerous sport in sight \u2013 Tom Brady was vague on whether he had sustained concussions last season. Concussions in the NFL have been under increased scrutiny in recent years. One of Brady\u2019s former team-mates, Junior Seau, killed himself in 2012 and was found to have the degenerative brain condition CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. A recent study of the brains of deceased NFL players showed that 110 out of 111 had signs of CTE. The study also claimed that longer careers exposed players to more severe cases of CTE. Brady is preparing to start his 18th season in the NFL. Earlier this year Brady\u2019s wife, Gisele Bundchen, said the New England Patriots quarterback has a history of concussions, including one suffered last season when he took his team to victory in the Super Bowl. On Friday, Brady addressed the subject while speaking to reporters at the Patriots\u2019 training facility. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into things that happened in my past, certainly medical history and so forth. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s anybody\u2019s business,\u201d Brady said. \u201cWhat happened last year; I\u2019m focused on this year and improving and working on things I need to get better at. \u201cSo that\u2019s how I approach everything. I\u2019m not sitting here worried about last year, or five years ago. There are other people that do worry about that \u2013 my wife, or my parents, or my sisters, people that love me and care about me. But I do the best I can do to be prepared to play \u2013 mentally and physically \u2013 and I give the game everything I can.\u201d Brady said he was aware of the dangers football brings. \u201cIt\u2019s a contact sport and I think we all understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of great benefits that football brings you but certainly you can be put in harm\u2019s way. So you just do the best you can do as a player and obviously it\u2019s great that there is more awareness for those types of things. That\u2019s been a very important topic, certainly. But you just try to be proactive and take care of your body the best way you can.\u201d Brady has said he plans to play for at least another five years, although in February he said Bundchen wants him to retire from the game: \u201cIf it was up to my wife, she would have me retire today. She told me that last night three times.\u201d"
"0||Icarus review \u2013 Netflix doping scandal doc is flawed but fascinatingFew filmmakers have stumbled upon documentary gold in quite as fortuitous a fashion as Bryan Fogel, the man behind this revelatory account of Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program. Primarily a playwright (he wrote an off-Broadway comedy called Jewtopia), Fogel is also a keen amateur cyclist and, in the wake of the Lance Armstrong scandal, set out to prove just how easy it was to evade cycling\u2019s creaking testing system by competing chemically enhanced in the same prestigious amateur race that he had struggled in the year before. The plan was to boost his best time, pass with flying colours through the urine tests required of all competitors and broadcast the results in muckraking documentary form. To help him perform this grand experiment, Fogel recruited a team of experts, one of whom pointed him in the direction of Grigory Rodchenkov, the eccentric director of Moscow\u2019s Anti-Doping Centre. And that\u2019s when things got really interesting. Rodchenkov threw himself into helping Fogel cheat the system with a level of enthusiasm that probably shouldn\u2019t be expected from the head of an anti-drugs unit, going as far as smuggling Fogel\u2019s urine through airport security. Even more extraordinarily, Rodchenkov openly admitted on camera that similarly nefarious methods were used to enhance the performances of his home country\u2019s athletes at the Sochi Winter Olympics, where Russia took home 13 gold medals. When, a few months later, the World Anti-Doping Association (Wada) released a report revealing the full extent of Russian state-sponsored doping and Rodchenkov\u2019s involvement in it, and Fogel received a panicked Skype call from Rodchenkov saying that he feared for his life and was going to flee to the US, Fogel\u2019s gonzo experiment had become a front-row seat to one of the biggest sporting scandals in decades. The resulting film, Icarus, gamely attempts to lash together this multi-stranded shaggy dog story into something approaching a coherent documentary-cum-conspiracy thriller. If it\u2019s not entirely successful, you can at least forgive its deficiencies given the access Fogel manages to acquire. On moving to the US, Rodchenkov morphs into a whisteblower, and his testimony is stunningly detailed, implicating everyone up to and including Vladimir Putin in the doping scandal and suggesting that it is something that has been going on across Russian sports for decades. Meanwhile, as the documentary progresses, Fogel finds himself becoming a more central figure in the story he\u2019s trying to tell. One remarkable scene sees him, in Rodchenkov\u2019s absence (due to safety concerns), testifying in front of a visibly angry group of Wada employees, suggesting to them that Rodchenkov, who has had to leave his home and family over the scandal, is himself a victim. Quite whether that\u2019s the case is questionable. Certainly its clear that Fogel has been won over by the ebullient Rodchenkov from the pair\u2019s very first meeting over Skype. You can see why: he\u2019s charismatic, makes for a great subject and is always willing to divulge a bit of devastating inside info to camera. At the same time though, there\u2019s an inescapable slipperiness to Rodchenkov\u2019s character that makes his testimony slightly hard to swallow. At points, he exhibits remorse at his actions, lamenting that Russia\u2019s medal haul at Sochi might have emboldened Putin in his decision to meddle in the Ukraine; other times he seems mischievously gleeful at his own nefarious deeds. Fogel doesn\u2019t quite seem to have the critical distance to ascertain what might be the true position. There are other failings too: at two hours, the film sags a little in the middle and certainly could have done without the clunky conceit in its second half, where Rodchenkov\u2019s testimony is bookended by him reading aloud from Orwell\u2019s 1984. But it\u2019s hard to deny the power of Icarus\u2019s message and the remarkable nature of its delivery. Icarus is now available on Netflix"
"8||You must include gay venue on site of Joiners Arms, planners tell developersGay bars in London are closing down at such an \u201calarming\u201d rate that the redevelopment of the Joiners Arms, an east London pub that counted Alexander McQueen, Rufus Wainwright and Wolfgang Tillmans among its regulars, will only get the go-ahead if it includes an LGBT club venue \u2013 and the mayor\u2019s office will send an inspector to make sure it is gay enough. Tower Hamlets council has told the developers of the Joiners site that their plans for offices and nine luxury flats will get planning permission only if it includes a pub that will \u201cremain a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-focused venue for a minimum of 12 years\u201d. It is believed to be the first time that the sexual orientation of a venue\u2019s customers has been included as a condition of planning approval. The borough\u2019s mayor, John Biggs, said: \u201cTower Hamlets council is committed to celebrating our great diversity, which includes serving the needs of our LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted that as a council we are leading the way in using innovative ways to protect spaces such as the Joiners Arms site.\u201d City Hall\u2019s culture at risk officer, Ed Bayes, will be involved in assessing licensee applications to ensure that the operator of the new bar will be sufficiently LGBT, and not seeking to open a gay bar in name only. Over the past decade London has lost 58% of its LGBT venues as their prime locations are snapped up by developers for regeneration and clubgoers abandon nights out for the convenience of Grindr, Tinder and other hookup apps. Eleven London boroughs, including Haringey, and Kensington and Chelsea, have lost all their LGBT bars. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has demanded that urgent action is taken to halt the \u201cshocking\u201d decline of LGBT bars, which he said were vital for the city\u2019s economy and diversity. Khan\u2019s office is pushing planners to do more to ensure that LGBT venues are protected from housing developments, which has led to the closure of several well-known bars in central and east London, including the Black Cap in Camden, The Queen\u2019s Head in Chelsea and the Joiners in Tower Hamlets. Councillors for Tower Hamlets, which has lost seven of its 10 LGBT venues since 2006, are scheduled to vote on the redevelopment plans for the Joiners site on Hackney Road on Wednesday night. The developer, Regal Homes, which bought the site in 2014, a year before the venue\u2019s closure in 2015, is understood to have agreed to the council\u2019s demands to give an LGBT operator first refusal on the lease. A spokesperson for Regal Homes said: \u201cThe development on Hackney Road will re-provide a public house at ground-floor level with the same floor space as the previous Joiners Arms pub. We are committed to keeping this space within our development in Tower Hamlets as a LGBT+ venue and have offered a right of first refusal on the lease to LGBT+ interested parties, including the Friends of the Joiners Arms and the New Joiners Arms. \u201cIf the lease is taken up by an interested party then the venue will be secured for at least 12 years for LGBT+ use. We have also agreed a rent-free period for the first year. We have met on numerous occasions with the Friends of the Joiners Arms, the New Joiners Arms and with the mayor\u2019s night tsar, Amy Lam\u00e9, to discuss the future of an LGBT+ venue at our development and fully endorse the LGBT+ venues charter.\u201d The intervention from Tower Hamlets council and City Hall came after a spirited campaign by the bars\u2019 regulars, who formed the Friends of the Joiners Arms pressure group. \u201cI hold LGBT+ venues in very high regard and have made it clear that protecting them is an integral part of my plans to grow London\u2019s night-time economy and culture,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe want to make it as easy as possible for LGBT+ venues to exist, and as difficult as possible for them to close. That is why I called for an annual audit of LGBT+ venues and, together with my night tsar Amy Lam\u00e9, we will do all we can to halt the closures of these precious venues and encourage others to open.\u201d Lam\u00e9, who has also intervened to help preserve Soho venue Molly Moggs (which will soon reopen as cocktail bar Compton Cross) and the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in Lambeth, said: \u201cI want to say loud and clear: if you own or visit an LGBT+ venue which you believe is in trouble, reach out to me before it\u2019s too late.\u201d The Joiners, which was opened as a gay bar by landlord David Pollard shortly after Tony Blair\u2019s landslide election victory in May 1997, quickly became an east London institution. Pollard was committed to the fair treatment of his staff and the Joiners was the first pub in the country to sign up to paying its employees the living wage. Paul Flynn, the author of Good As You: From Prejudice to Pride \u2013 30 Years of Gay Britain and a Joiners regular, said the pub attracted a mixed, diverse and relaxed crowd because of its laid-back vibe that made it \u201ca genuine meeting place for actual outsiders\u201d. Flynee added: \u201cIt encouraged a reckless attitude from its patrons which was really exciting. It felt like the local council had nothing to do with it. That it has taken the council to step in and retain it as a gay space just tells you how severe the loss of gay spaces across London has become. \u201cThey are closing because of simple economic factors and greed, with so much money being offered by developers. But the gay culture in the 2010s has changed a lot, too. Meeting people has dramatically changed with app culture, especially gay apps.\u201d Flynn said it was great that the council had stepped in to retain the site as a gay space, but added: \u201cYou can\u2019t legislate for a party to kick off like it did in the Joiners.\u201d Many of Pollard\u2019s customers were leading lights of fashion, music and the arts. Among the regulars were the late fashion designer McQueen, singer-songwriters Wainwright and Patrick Wolf, designer Christopher Kane, actor Rupert Everett and former Westlife singer Mark Feehily. Craig Green, who was named British menswear designer of the year in January, got one of his first jobs working behind the bar, and Turner prize-winning artist Tillmans was often seen documenting life in the bar with his camera. The pub has been immortalised in Bloc Party\u2019s 2007 track On, which includes the line: \u201cHidden away in every locked toilet I\u2019ve been waiting for you in the Joiners Arms.\u201d Kele Okereke, its frontman, was also often to be found at the bar\u2019s juke box or fruit machine. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to find anyone to remember stories of famous people or otherwise in the Joiners you\u2019ll have trouble,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cMost people can\u2019t remember what happened. It was genuinely a bacchanal place.\u201d"
"7||Neymar: how the record-breaking \u20ac222m move to PSG unfoldedSometimes, life is as simple as a phone call. In Neymar and PSG\u2019s case, it was indeed a phone call that made the biggest transfer in football history possible. After three weeks of negotiations, brainstormings, discussions and arguments, the Parisians welcomed the Brazilian superstar on Friday. And like every transfer, the inside story is the most fascinating aspect. Neymar is a Paris Saint-Germain player, a sentence that the French club never thought people would say. It was a dream that looked unreachable, unfeasible. PSG had tried hard last summer. They thought they had their man, one of those superstars they have been chasing for years. Instead, they were shocked when the Brazilian told them that he had changed his mind and he was signing a new deal with Barcelona. PSG felt used, and were used, but they moved on quickly. This summer, they had forgotten about Neymar. In order of interest, their main targets were Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Philippe Coutinho or Sergio Ag\u00fcero. They thought their nemesis was staying put. But one call changed everything. When the Brazilian\u2019s entourage called Nasser al-Khelaifi, the PSG chairman, to inform him that Neymar was ready to leave Barcelona, there was no hesitation. Paris needed Neymar to take their project to a new level, to reach the stars. So the secret talks started. After renewing with the Catalan club last November, Neymar\u2019s release clause went up from \u20ac190m to \u20ac222m. If the Parisians wanted their man, they would have to cough up the whole amount of the release clause, paying the biggest transfer fee ever. After a few internal meetings, the PSG hierarchy decided that the club could afford to recruit the superstar. They remained adamant that the commercial impact of Neymar\u2019s arrival (shirt sales, extra ticket revenues, new sponsorship deals) would cover most of the cost of the transfer anyway. The French club did not want to be at fault with the regulations of financial fair play. They even considered at some point recruiting both Neymar and S\u00e1nchez from Arsenal before concentrating solely on the Brazilian. The player and PSG quickly agreed on a five-year deal worth \u20ac30m net per season. Pini Zahavi, the Israeli agent, who brokered the deal for Neymar to join Barcelona from Santos in the summer 2013, was at the heart of all the negotiations. PSG\u2019s lawyers, Nataf Fajgenbaum &amp; Associ\u00e9s, drafted the contract, ready to be signed. In Paris, Dani Alves, one of Neymar\u2019s best friends and a former Barcelona team-mate, lobbied for his fellow Brazilian to join him in Paris where he had just signed. On 14 July, Neymar returned to training with Barcelona after his holidays. On 18 July, rumours of the potential biggest transfer in history appeared for the first time on social media. Three days later, French and Catalan media stated that the deal was pretty much done. Yet it took another two weeks before it became official. Barcelona were determined to do everything they could to keep Neymar at the Camp Nou. From Lionel Messi to Luis Su\u00e1rez and Gerard Piqu\u00e9, they all tried to convince him to stay. Despite the agreement being in place, the player was still not sure what to do. His father, Neymar Sr, who is the biggest influence on him, wanted him to stay in Catalonia. Neymar Jr does not usually contradict him. He did this time. As much as he loves Messi and loves playing with him, he wanted his own team. He wanted to be the boss, the centre of attention, to be a Ballon d\u2019Or contender. He also wanted a new challenge after winning everything possible in four seasons at Barcelona. His ambitions matched those of PSG. There, in the dressing room, he already had some of his best friends: Not only Alves but also Lucas Moura, whom he met when they were six years old; Marquinhos, with whom he goes on holiday; and Thiago Silva, who was his captain with Brazil. Neymar\u2019s mind was now set on moving to the French capital. On Wednesday, he announced his decision to Barcelona. His mother and his sister flew over from Brazil to Paris. They moved into a suite at the luxurious Royal Monceau hotel in the centre of the city. Neymar, via Porto where he completed his medical, finally signed his PSG contract in Barcelona on Thursday alongside Jean-Claude Blanc, the PSG CEO and Marcos Motta, one of his lawyers. Which number will he wear? Javier Pastore, who took over the No10 shirt after the departure of Zlatan Ibrahimovic last summer, announced that he had given Neymar the famous number. Everything was ready. The unveiling could start. Neymar arrived in Paris by private jet on Friday morning. The first day of his new life."
"6||The Guardian view on the monarchy: reinventing the brandPrince Philip has taken advantage of the privilege of being a mere consort and with a cheery wave of the bowler hat under torrential rain on Wednesday he retired. At least, he has given up pre-booked dates. He will still on occasion be seen out with the Queen, who doesn\u2019t have retirement in her employment contract. His has been an extraordinary life of public service and although it would be fair to say his outlook on life is not one shared by the Guardian, it is impossible not to admire his sheer bloody-minded resilience. It is becoming the hallmark of the dynasty that he married into 70 years ago this year. Managing extreme old age \u2013 the prince is 96 \u2013 is a new challenge for the monarchy, but only one of many that this extraordinary institution now has to confront. It is doing so with the kind of professionalism that has also become typical since its hold on popular esteem seemed genuinely challenged in the dark days between the row over the taxpayer paying for the 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the death of Princess Diana five years later. That was when the Palace, and notably Prince Charles, learned about corporate brand management, and they have become masters of its arts. That is why there is now a well-advanced exercise in brand reinvention under way. The trick is to win over a new market without alienating the old one. The Queen and Prince Philip belong to the mid 20th century, an age that was appalled by public demonstrations of emotion, that was privately as well as publicly stoical in the face of all adversity. They had to embody and project in themselves, and in everything they did, the continuity and decency that were the justification for the survival of empire and commonwealth. Both of them are old enough to remember the abdication crisis of 1936. They would not be where they are were it not for the horror stirred in the heart of the empire by the idea of Edward VIII marrying the divorced Wallis Simpson. It is dizzying to contemplate the gulf in time and culture between the age when addressing the nation on the wireless once a year was an innovation, and having a Facebook page and Instagram account that are updated every day. This is an object lesson in the application of the key rules of reinvention: adapt, but don\u2019t ditch the heritage; recognise how much the target market has changed; respond to the great millennial fear of missing out by making sure they can feel involved; abandon the stiff upper lip. After Princess Diana\u2019s death, the Queen notoriously struggled to go through the motions of showing her feelings. Now the princes champion mental-health charities and hug old ladies with warmth. This has been a time of ends and beginnings. Not only was there Prince Philip\u2019s last hurrah; Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, has flown his last air ambulance mission. His life is now devoted to being royal. Unfinished business has been sorted. He and his brother have paid tribute to their mother in the public send-off that they were too young to give her when she died. The ITV documentary film that aired last month served as a public bookend to their terrible personal tragedy of experiencing divorce and bereavement through the claustrophobic straitjacket of a constitutional crisis. For all its embarrassment quotient, this Sunday\u2019s Channel 4 programme, in which footage of Diana filmed by her speech coach will be aired for the first time in Britain, also means a humiliation avoided: bad now, perhaps, but much, much worse if it were aired after Prince Charles had become king. In all this, it is the heir to the throne who is invisible. It is almost as if the plan is to present the world with a buy one, get two free monarchy. Charles the meddling monarch may be a hard sell. But throw in William and Kate too, and it\u2019s a proposition: a brand reinvented, the future embraced but the past respected. The real questions about monarchy go beyond PR, but by straightening out their image the royals have quelled any clamour to raise them."
"6||The Guardian view on Iran: the nuclear deal is not a disaster \u2013 but scrapping it could be\r\nWhen the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, is sworn in again on Saturday, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and ministers from Britain, France and Germany will be in Tehran to watch; an indication of how far relations with the west warmed in his first term. Yet as he embarks upon his second, he may feel the chill. Despite defeating his conservative rival by a landslide in May\u2019s elections, opposition is ranged against him at home and abroad. The great domestic uncertainty he faces \u2013 supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is 78 and without a clear successor \u2013 is for now overshadowed by Donald Trump\u2019s threat to pull out of the landmark nuclear deal signed in 2015. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors its implementation, says Iran is complying with the requirements to curb its nuclear programme and accept inspections in return for sanctions relief. But Mr Trump has vowed to overturn the Obama administration\u2019s stand-out foreign policy achievement. He has twice signed the sanctions waiver, but with extreme reluctance. He has asked aides to find a way to ditch the deal and says he expects Iran to be declared non-compliant next month. Officials say it has breached the pact \u201cin spirit\u201d. Mr Rouhani promised that the agreement would bring prosperity. Iran\u2019s economy is growing again; he has slashed inflation and stabilised the currency. But poverty has risen, a quarter of young people are unemployed, and foreign investment remains well below projections. Iranians have not yet felt the benefits they expected. Alongside the economic dissatisfaction run other concerns. Younger people especially want reform, and to see more women in government, and better links with the outside world. Meanwhile, the president\u2019s hardline opponents, including the Revolutionary Guard and the judiciary, have portrayed the deal as a capitulation for little reward \u2013 not least, because it challenges their vested interests. They sense opportunity; note the recent detention of Mr Rouhani\u2019s brother. Iranian presidents are usually weakened in their second term and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has fired a shot across the president\u2019s bows by implying a parallel with Abolhassan Banisadr, a reformist removed from office early. For now, Iran\u2019s elite seems to be playing down divisions. That may make it harder for the US to push Tehran into abandoning the agreement, as Mr Trump apparently hoped. Iran says the US is breaching it by applying separate sanctions relating to missiles and human rights, but does not want to walk away. European parties to the deal want to shore it up; France\u2019s Total signed a multibillion-dollar gas deal with Iran last month. But should the US pull out, secondary sanctions would hobble foreign companies seeking to do business with Iran. Iran has much to answer for; most of all, assisting Bashar al-Assad\u2019s crimes against his people in Syria. The country\u2019s grim human rights record at home is further tarnished by the deteriorating health of opposition leaders Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi, held under house arrest since the popular protests of 2011. Its elections are anything but free and fair \u2013 yet they are competitive, meaningful and much more than most US allies in the region offer. No one could deny that Mr Rouhani is a very different president to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Yet Mr Trump greeted his re-election by throwing US weight more fully behind Saudi Arabia in its struggle with Iran for regional hegemony. American hostility can only bolster the isolationist, hardline forces ranged against Mr Rouhani; against the wishes and instincts of the Iranian people; against stability in the region and indeed against the interests of the US. Even defence secretary James Mattis \u2013 who has defined the three gravest threats facing the US as \u201cIran, Iran, Iran\u201d \u2013 is among those pressing to maintain the deal. The president he serves calls the agreement a disaster. But Mr Trump is, as usual, wrong. It is scrapping it that could court catastrophe."
"5||Editing embryo DNA is an exciting landmark, but in reality will benefit fewIt is hard to overstate the importance of the moment. For billions of years, life on Earth has been shaped, slowly and incrementally, by dumb evolution. But in research this week, scientists showed how that might change. With advanced genetic engineering tools, a US-Korean team mended dangerous heart disease mutations in human embryos for the first time. The feat paves the way for radical new treatments \u2013 and for humans to take control of their genetic destiny. The ability to edit human genomes may one day transform people\u2019s lives, but in breaking new ground, it would cross a line that has long been controversial. Today, many countries prohibit the creation of genetically altered people, even if the procedure would spare them a devastating and life-shortening disease. The caution comes from the fact that changes to an embryo\u2019s DNA affect not only the child in question, but their sperm or eggs. When the time came, they would pass on the modifications \u2013 and any harmful side-effects the procedure may cause \u2013 to their children and future generations. The risk of causing unintended harm to unknown numbers of people is only one concern. Inevitably, the ability to tweak the DNA of unborn children raises the prospect of designer babies. There are broader fears too: that eradicating certain mutations could threaten people\u2019s identities, and even the sense of what it means to be human. \u201cIf we change our DNA forever, are we still human? I think we are a lot more than our DNA, but people have different answers to that question,\u201d said Christine Watson, professor of cell and cancer biology at Cambridge. The work by the US and Korean team is a milestone. Around the world, a handful of groups are exploring how to correct faulty genes in human embryos in the hope of preventing terrible diseases from being passed on. Until now, all have come up against the same brick walls. Having treated embryos for harmful mutations, tests reveal that some still linger, leading to what are called \u201cmosaic\u201d embryos. Another common glitch is that the very procedure meant to fix bad mutations causes fresh ones elsewhere, producing so-called \u201coff-target effects\u201d and posing a cancer risk. The researchers overcame both these hurdles by performing the editing procedure when the sperm and egg first met. \u201cThe big step forward is that they managed to correct the mutation, have a very low level of mosaic embryos, and seemingly no off-target effects,\u201d said Watson. \u201cThat for me is the big safety concern: that by correcting one mutation you introduce another and who knows what that might do.\u201d At face value, the research has enormous potential. More than 10,000 inherited diseases might be prevented by correcting harmful mutations. Many of them are serious, such as Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, Huntington\u2019s disease, and breast cancer linked to mutations in the BRCA gene. But in reality, very few people would benefit if existing bans on genetically altered embryos were suddenly lifted. In the majority of cases, people who know they carry a heritable disease, and who want genetically-related children, can go through IVF and have their embryos screened for harmful mutations. Fertility doctors do this every day and select only the healthiest embryos to implant in prospective mothers. In their study, the US-Korean team showed that genome editing could boost the number of embryos free from heart disease mutations from 50% to 72%. In the clinic, that would give doctors more healthy embryos to choose from. But as Tom Shakespeare, professor of disability research at Norwich Medical School, points out, it doesn\u2019t help parents dramatically. \u201cAs of now, what\u2019s been achieved is no better than what we already have. If I have a 50% chance of passing on my condition, and then I have a complex procedure that lowers that to 28%, it hasn\u2019t solved the problem,\u201d he said. There are situations where embryo screening cannot work, and where genome editing could help. The classic example is a person who carries two copies of the mutation that causes Huntington\u2019s disease. Every embryo created from their sperm or eggs would carry at least one disease gene, enough for the condition to take hold. In this case, genome editing could help by overwriting the Huntington\u2019s mutation with a functional copy of the gene. But the number of people who carry two Huntington\u2019s genes is vanishingly rare, measured in the dozens worldwide. \u201cWe are really talking about a very, very small set of people and it\u2019s easy to forget that because the science is so exciting,\u201d said Karen Yeung, director of the Centre for Technology, Ethics and Law in Society at King\u2019s College London and chair of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Group on Genome Editing and Human Reproduction. One of the issues ethicists still grapple with is how to weigh up the common desire for people to have genetically-related children rather than adopt or simply have no children. A more effective way to reduce genetic disease could be a national genetic testing program that identifies people who are carriers of harmful genes and at risk of passing them on. \u201cI think the only way we\u2019ll make progress with genome editing is when sequencing is cheap enough that every baby will have their genome sequenced at birth,\u201d said Watson. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be cheap enough to do that soon, but will people think it\u2019s acceptable?\u201d In the UK it is illegal to implant a genetically altered embryo in a woman, and regulators in the US and other countries disallow the procedure. The situation is unlikely to change soon, according to Chris Gyngell, a bioethicist at Oxford. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be strong political will to change the law in the next few years, and probably not until babies are born elsewhere in the world that turn out to be fit and healthy.\u201d One of the barriers to lifting the ban is that genes, and therefore the risks of altering them, are so poorly understood. Genes rarely have only one job in the body, so a change here can cause an unexpected effect elsewhere. One dual role that is known about comes from HIV research, where people with mutations in the CCR5 gene are resistant to HIV, but more susceptible to West Nile virus. But plenty of other genes are not so well understood. With all the risks inherent in genome editing, Shakespeare is not convinced that there will be a huge demand for designer babies, even if the many genes that influence traits like intelligence and a sparkling personality are ever found. \u201cBehavioural genetics is so complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say environment will be far more important than genetics for the foreseeable future. You can see from the current cabinet that it doesn\u2019t matter how intelligent you are, it matters what school you went to.\u201d"
"6||Fake news is bad. But fake history is even worseOn 22 July, the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n stood before university students and delivered a speech titled \u201cWill Europe belong to Europeans?\u201d It contained rambling passages about how a \u201cSoros plan\u201d was in place to bring in \u201chundreds of thousands of migrants every year \u2013 if possible, a million \u2013 to the territory of the European Union from the Muslim world\u201d. The aim was to transform the continent into \u201ca new, Islamised Europe\u201d. This, Orb\u00e1n argued, was what lay behind \u201cBrussels\u2019 continuous and stealthy withdrawal of powers from the nation states\u201d. Orb\u00e1n has form when it comes to this kind of paranoid vision. He\u2019s an authoritarian populist who has made a habit of stoking xenophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment. He eagerly amplifies far-right conspiracy theories about the Christian majority being threatened by demographic \u201creplacement\u201d. His message isn\u2019t just fake news about the present, however. It comes laced with historical distortion. \u201cNot since the treaty of Trianon\u201d, he gloated, \u201chas our nation been as close as it is today to regaining its confidence and vitality\u201d \u2013 a reference to the post-first world war treaty that deprived Hungary of two-thirds of its territory. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s guiding idea is that Hungary must seek redress for historical humiliations. The suggestion is that, as his government clashes with the EU on migration quotas, it is avenging grievances rooted in the 20th century. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s manipulations go further, and involve completely rewriting dark chapters of the past. He\u2019s on the record as saying Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, the Hungarian leader who cooperated with the Nazis, was an \u201cexceptional statesman\u201d. Of course, he\u2019s not alone in twisting history to further his political goals. In Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey, school books have been modified to de-emphasise Ataturk, the founder of the secular republic. It\u2019s all part of an effort to reverse that legacy and glorify the Ottoman past, as Erdo\u011fan carves out ever more powers for himself. Controlling memory is at the heart of the Putin regime in Russia. Not only has Stalin been rehabilitated, with new monuments built to honour him across the country, but historians and human rights activists who work to document Stalinist crime have come under political pressure. Some, like Yury Dmitriyev, have been tried on trumped-up charges. And rewriting the Soviet past doesn\u2019t just serve domestic political purposes. Negating the crimes of Soviet occupation in central and eastern Europe, and excusing the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact with the Nazis, provides justification for Moscow reclaiming its \u201czone of influence\u201d. In Xi Jinping\u2019s China, any mention of the horrors of the Cultural Revolution or of the Tiananmen square massacre is stamped out because it\u2019s seen as a challenge to Communist party rule. Collective amnesia is what the regime seeks on issues that risk undermining its legitimacy. It\u2019s not enough to throw dissidents in prison or censor information; the past is purged. And while it\u2019s tempting to think the rewriting of history is something found exclusively in illiberal or dictatorial systems, it has increasingly become a feature of democracies. Donald Trump\u2019s speech in Warsaw last month strove to cast Poland\u2019s historical struggle for freedom and independence as a \u201ccivilisational\u201d battle for family values, \u201ctradition\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d, rather than an aspiration to democracy. The narrative entirely left out of the rich and varied political tapestry that gave rise to the solidarity movement. In a strange twist, Trump also drew a parallel between the threat Islamist terrorism poses to \u201cthe west\u201d and the \u201cdanger\u201d of \u201cbureaucracy and regulation\u201d. His nativist vision of the west as an embattled fortress of Christian nations in cultural danger reflected not only a personal political credo, but a wider attempt to rewrite the history of liberal democracies and the principles they are meant to uphold. In Britain, Brexiteers have proven willing to supply their own version of history. Nostalgia for the days of empire and their \u201cswashbuckling spirit\u201d comes accompanied with the mantra that the European project was a tyrannical straitjacket all along. Britain never had a say in anything the EU decided, and now it has a chance to \u201cfree\u201d itself, so the story goes. Never mind that Britain was at the table, a full and influential member of a club its citizens and its economy have benefited from. Fanaticism alters not only the perception of current realities (as negotiations limp forward), it also adjusts the past to suit one set of beliefs. George Orwell\u2019s 1984 contains a well-known phrase about history and its importance: \u201cHe who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past\u201d. We worry rightly about the impact of fake news, but today\u2019s nationalist passions are even more deeply rooted in the distortion of history, which citizens in many countries lap up despite the fact it is poison. The past has always been a battleground. The 20th century showed to what extremes state control over memory could go. Primo Levi, who experienced the nightmare of Nazi concentration camps, once wrote that the entire history of the Reich \u201ccan be re-read as a war against memory\u201d. One of the blessings of living in a democracy is that researchers, students, journalists and citizens at large can all access the past without having to subject themselves to any form of centralised, censoring control. The philosopher Tzvetan Todorov has described this as \u201cone of the most inalienable freedoms, alongside the freedom to think and express oneself\u201d. Yet the security of memory in democratic societies may not be as assured as we think. Some politicians want to lead us in a march towards forgetfulness. But that way lies a world of senselessness and deceit. Learning about history, and being able to question some of the narratives advanced in the name of politics is as important as knowing where to get reliable news. \u201cCan history save us from ourselves?\u201d asked the historian Timothy Snyder at a recent conference on the nation state and the many falsehoods politicians attach to it. Perhaps it can. \u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de is a Guardian leader writer, columnist and foreign affairs commentator"
"13||'Talk out of their arses': sexist critics butt of the joke in Edinburgh showThere is one unwritten rule of theatre: do not read your reviews, let alone respond to your critics. But the Edinburgh fringe is where the rules are made to be broken and three female performers have decided that this year, when it comes to the critics, they are fighting back. Wild Bore is the first collaborative effort by two comedians, Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr from Australia and Adrienne Truscott from the US, and Ursula Martinez, a British performer. In their previous work, all three have openly grappled with female sexuality, nudity, rape jokes, sexism in comedy and giving patriarchy a collective middle finger. Having met on the festival circuit, the trio based their show on conversations about the absurd, sexist and often ignorant ways that they, as female performers, were described by critics. \u201cWe started swapping stories of reviews that we\u2019d been given or compare many times we\u2019d been called whimsical or kooky,\u201d says Truscott. Much of the problem, they say, is that even reviewers who are not white males still hold theatre and comedy to patriarchal standards and expectations. \u201cIt\u2019s not intentional, it\u2019s not malicious, but critics are part of a world which has patriarchal structures and patriarchal language. That\u2019s where its foundations lie, so it\u2019s constant work to undo that if you\u2019re not a man,\u201d says Coombs Marr. \u201cAnd if critics don\u2019t understand it, then most of the time they don\u2019t take kindly to it.\u201d Martinez adds: \u201cWe saw so many times where a male reviewer didn\u2019t get a performance, so they decided it was so out there and wacky that it was relevant to no one. The arrogance of the attitude that if as a straight white male they didn\u2019t understand it, then obviously it made no sense to anybody.\u201d The stigma is particularly noticeable when women attempt to reinvent the canon or touch what critics view as \u201cprecious traditional theatre\u201d. Coombs Marr says: \u201cEven if you have a female Hamlet, or something like that, then it\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t touch Shakespeare, don\u2019t have a female perspective on Macbeth.\u2019 But what if I\u2019m a female who has a perspective on Macbeth? You\u2019re just not allowed to.\u201d The trio\u2019s show has been built entirely from lines lifted from reviews of theatre and comedy, not just of their work but of other female performers, and comes together as a review in itself. It directly addresses how the female body is treated on stage, the insistence on sexualising it and objectifying it \u2013 \u201ceven when a woman is dressed as something completely asexual like a box of sultanas\u201d \u2013 and how almost every review of a female comedian mentions what she wears or the colour of her hair. Wild Bore had a brief run in Melbourne before coming to Edinburgh, and while it mostly got rave reviews, it still attracted some of the very same sexist or ignorant responses that inspired it in the first place. As part of the performance, Coombs Marr, Martinez and Truscott sit backwards, with their naked bottoms in front of microphones, a comedically literal representation of the many critics who \u201ctalk out of their arses\u201d. \u201cOne guy, who was writing for a major newspaper, reviewed the show and he basically reviewed our arses,\u201d says Coombs Marr. \u201cHe wrote: \u2018There were three bottoms: one tan, one spotty and one good old-fashioned fleshy white.\u2019 Firstly, don\u2019t do that, don\u2019t describe and rank our bottoms. If there were three male bottoms would you even be bothering to describe what they\u2019re like? And why is something \u2018good\u2019 if it\u2019s old-fashioned and white? And why is white \u2018old-fashioned\u2019? Why is white \u2018good\u2019?\u201d Truscott adds: \u201cOur arses aren\u2019t on stage to be like, \u2018Look at my tan arse.\u2019 \u201cThey\u2019re functioning as critics, literal arseholes with microphones. We\u2019re not being sexual, we\u2019re not being pretty, we\u2019re not even being gendered. How did you still just see us as naked female flesh?\u201d The show also serves to emphasise the way that the talents of female and gay performers are still so often dismissed. Truscott says one of the most common assumptions made by male critics is that even when female comedians are being funny, it is accidental, and that they have no agency over their own performance. She describes one show of hers in which, for comic effect, she had \u201crun out of material\u201d for five minutes of the show. \u201cIn the review, they wrote: \u2018And she doesn\u2019t even realise that the funniest part of her show is when she runs out of material.\u2019 The critic just assumed I made a show that was too short and for 30 nights in a row I was like, \u2018Darn, I still can\u2019t think of another thing to say. Thank goodness people are laughing otherwise I\u2019d have to write something.\u2019\u201d Truscott says another particularly infuriating trope of reviews they take on in the show is that male comedians and performers are so often described as \u201crelatable\u201d, or \u201cthe kind of guy you\u2019d go and have a beer with over a BBQ\u201d. Coombs Marr chips in: \u201cA classic line we read so often was, \u2018He was just a regular good bloke, a really relatable guy.\u2019 Yeah, relatable to you because you are the same as him. Or: \u2018He talked about things we can all relate to, like buying shelving in Ikea with the wife.\u2019 I\u2019ve literally never done that and probably never will.\u201d In contrast, Truscott points out one unnamed comedy critic, who is a regular at the fringe, where \u201cif a woman\u2019s doing really blue material, he\u2019ll comment things like \u2018she wouldn\u2019t make very good mothering material\u2019\u201d. \u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t want to be a mother at that moment \u2013 she wants to be a comedian,\u201d says Truscott. \u201cAnd I reckon not a lot of men are taken to task for their potential for parenting because of their comic material.\u201d Truscott, Coombs Marr and Martinez are keen to emphasise that Wild Bore is as much a celebration of critics and criticism, a homage to the unusual and often ludicrous turns of phrases used by reviewers, as a criticism of the craft. \u201cWe\u2019re doing the thing you\u2019re not supposed to do. The critic is supposed to have the last word and art is supposed to speak for itself,\u201d says Truscott. \u201cBut there\u2019s real catharsis in throwing the critics\u2019 words back at them, to finally get to turn it back round on them.\u201d \u2022 Wild Bore is at the Traverse, Edinburgh, 8\u201327 August (not 14 or 21), then Soho theatre, London, 21 November to 16 December."
"14||Grenfell Tower: local people should be on inquiry panel, bishop saysA panel of people drawn from the local community should be appointed to advise the chair of the Grenfell Tower inquiry, according to the bishop whose diocese covers the building where the deadly inferno took place. The bishop of Kensington said that judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick should establish a panel that would \u201crepresent the local community and win their confidence\u201d in a submission to the inquiry. The Rev Graham Tomlin\u2019s remarks echoed the voice of local campaign groups such as Justice4Grenfell, which said local people \u201cmust be placed at the heart of this inquiry\u201d and argued that the former judge\u2019s advisory panel was \u201cunrepresentative and non-diverse\u201d. The bishop\u2019s submission was one of 330 sent to the public inquiry before the consultation period\u2019s 5pm deadline on Friday. They came from individuals, community groups, campaigners, professional bodies, politicians and faith leaders. Tomlin suggested that a panel reflecting the diversity of the community could \u201c represent both the local community and win their confidence, and \u2026 can bring the perspectives of a wider range of our society, socially and ethnically, to the important issues the inquiry will examine\u201d. After considering the submissions, Moore-Bick will write to the prime minister with his own recommendations. Theresa May is expected to set the terms of reference in the middle of August, after which the inquiry will have legal status and can begin work. Moore-Bick has been criticised by North Kensington residents and politicians, who have suggested he lacks the confidence of local people. The 70-year-old former judge is seen by some as aloof and lacking empathy and he alarmed some residents by saying soon after his appointment that the investigations would be limited to the technical causes of the fire. Emma Dent Coad, the Labour MP for Kensington, said on Friday she still did not have \u201ctotal confidence\u201d in Moore-Bick, but \u201cwe have to work with the system we have, unfortunately\u201d. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she suggested the experts Moore-Bick had brought in to advise him had generated greater confidence. Justice4Grenfell said in its submission that the inquiry had not won public confidence, citing a previous judgment of Moore-Bick allowing Westminster council to rehouse a homeless family 50 miles away and the \u201cunrepresentative and non-diverse makeup\u201d of his advisory panel. It said: \u201cVictims and survivors must be placed at the heart of this inquiry so that all findings and recommendations are grounded in the experiences and accounts of those victims and survivors. \u201cThe inquiry should not have a focus solely on the traditional legal \u2018facts and judgment\u2019 process. Instead, it should carefully consider the emotional needs of all the key stakeholders, particularly the survivors and bereaved families.\u201d Justice4Grenfell, along with other groups who made submissions, called on Moore-Bick to establish a panel drawn from the local community that would reflect its ethnic diversity and social background. According to sources close to the inquiry, Moore-Bick is considering recommending an advisory panel in his letter to May, which will be sent to Downing Street next week. He is also minded to recommend a two-stage inquiry: the first part dealing with the immediate causes of the fire and producing an interim report; the second looking at broader issues over a longer time-frame. Dent Coad said a legal commitment must be given to a second stage. \u201cWe need to look at all the broader issues. One of the concerns about a two-part inquiry \u2013 like with Hillsborough \u2013 is if it\u2019s held off for too long and then it doesn\u2019t happen at all, so that\u2019s a concern.\u201d The first stage should \u201clook at accountability and recommendations straight away so that the things that have become most obvious throughout the inquiry are put into action straight away\u201d, the MP said. In a submission made public last month, David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham who lost a family friend in the fire, backed a two-stage investigation into the specific causes and circumstances of the blaze and its implications for national policy. The first stage, according to Lammy, should cover the policies and decisions of Kensington and Chelsea council and the Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), and the London fire brigade\u2019s \u201cstay put\u201d policy, which some have suggested contributed to the high number of deaths. The second stage should address \u201csystemic failure at a local and national level when it comes to the provision, management and administration of social housing in this country\u201d. The bishop of Kensington also proposed a two-stage inquiry: first, to look at the cause of the fire and decisions taken on the night of 14 June, and second, to look at decisions and issues over a number of years that may have contributed to the disaster. Tomlin suggested there should be a separate independent commission on housing in London to examine the regulation of a housing market \u201cthat often seems more focused on investment than actually housing people\u201d. So-called affordable housing was not affordable for many people and there was not enough social housing, he said in his submission. \u201cThis creates the kind of divided communities we have seen in Kensington, leading to disparity and social tension.\u201d Tomlin told the Guardian: \u201cThere are parts of London where the only people who can live there are either the very poor or the very wealthy, and nothing in between. That contributes to this sense \u2013 which is concentrated in Kensington \u2013 of two very different communities, one very wealthy and one very disadvantaged, right next door to each other. It exacerbates a sense of dislocation.\u201d Justice4Grenfell said it believed \u201cthe causes of this disaster need to be tracked to those at the highest levels of central government, and not restricted to those at local authority level, the KCTMO, the contractors and the subcontractors\u201d. It urged a two-part inquiry, on the immediate causes of the fire and the \u201cwider and more complex issues\u201d. Inquest, an organisation that campaigns for justice for people who have died in contentious circumstances, said the inquiry must \u201caddress the pain, trauma and individual and community damage caused by the tragedy, and the lack of public trust and confidence in the state institutions involved\u201d. It suggested three areas for the inquiry to examine: the background leading up to the fire; its cause, spread and impact and the immediate emergency response; and the aftermath of the fire \u2013 including \u201cthe role that discrimination, inequality or institutional indifference played in the systemic failures in the aftermath and the response at a local and national level\u201d. A submission from Hackney council in east London urged the inquiry to review the current system of housing regulations to put safety and residents first and to examine the impact of cuts to local authority budgets since 2010 on fire safety. It called for \u201can urgent interim report to reassure those affected by the fire and give local authorities clarity on funding and safety issues\u201d. After the terms of reference have been set, the inquiry will contact organisations relevant to its investigation, such as the local council, KCTMO and fire brigade. Individuals and groups will be able to apply for \u201ccore participant status\u201d, giving them certain rights in the process. The first hearing is likely to be in September, although it will be a preliminary \u201chousekeeping\u201d session. Hearings at which evidence is heard are expected to start later in the year."
"6||Ten years on, we\u2019re getting into another debt crisisWe are 10 years on from the start of the financial crisis, and unsecured consumer debt has reached more than \u00a3200bn for the first time since 2008. It\u2019s up 10%, year on year. The best that can be said of the matter, as compared to the pre-crash debt boom, is that at least there are worries about it. The Bank of England and the credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s are among those who have warned that the situation could be problematic. Which seems like an understatement. These guys are talking about big-picture risks to the economy, which generally adores debt. But at street level, the Financial Conduct Authority warns that one in six people with debt on credit cards, personal lending and car loans is in trouble. That\u2019s 2.2 million stressed-out individuals. A TUC report, Britain in the Red, highlighted this issue a year ago. It suggested that the problem is greater than official figures show, with 3.2 million households in problem debt \u2013 defined as spending more than 25% of income on unsecured loans \u2013 and 1.6 million households in extreme debt, paying out more than 40% of their income. It\u2019s horrific. One of many egregious examples of victim-blaming in the wake of the financial crisis was the idea that everyone in Britain was responsible for the mess, all of us having decided to party recklessly only to greet our hangovers with amazement. The general idea was that consumer debt was providing the nation with designer handbags, cashmere jumpers and vintage champagne. Apparently. And if there\u2019s one thing that similar accusations could be made about now, it\u2019s cars. The cliche was true, for some people. For those who had bought their homes before or early on in the post-1997 property boom, a quick remortgage was the easy way to buy all sorts of things. But those who bought near the top of the market \u2013 and who are still buying \u2013 may find that if interest rates go up, financial trouble could quickly follow. The Insolvency Service warns that a 1% rise could leave 18,000 people bankrupt. Attitudes to credit card debt did change in the wake of the crisis, as lenders hiked their rates. Now, zero interest deals are abundant again. Lots of people manage their cards by simply transferring their debt. Data from January suggests that 43% of credit card users had a zero interest deal. But that still leaves millions in persistent debt. Lenders want customers who only manage the minimum payment every month, and they\u2019re getting them. Personal loans remain a problem too. Before the crash, the payday loan industry wasn\u2019t the behemoth it quickly became. But even then, lots of people were already borrowing just to make ends meet. In the boom-time Britain of 2006, a quarter of a million people were already using \u201cshort-term\u201d loans. Recent regulation has lessened the ability of payday lenders to ruthlessly exploit the vulnerable. But what regulation cannot stop is need. In 2017, even fewer people can manage on the money that\u2019s coming into their household. Debt, often, is not providing luxuries but basic necessities. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to work out why. Wages have stagnated, while prices are rising inexorably. After 2007, households did put off the purchase of new items, but that can only go on for a certain amount of time. Things get old. Things break. Things need to be replaced. Many personal loans are on rent-to-buy deals, with modern necessities such as white goods acquired this way more and more. People don\u2019t save up for these things any longer \u2013 not least because low interest rates don\u2019t encourage saving at all. People are saving less, so fewer households have a financial cushion when big-ticket items are needed. But the biggest problem, of course, is our skewed economy, in which wages simply don\u2019t cover the cost of living. While low pay has been a problem in the UK for a long time, there were at least, before austerity, attempts to subsidise the low-paid through tax credits. Now, instead, it\u2019s all stick rather than carrot. The welfare state is utilised as a way of punishing people for being dependent, forcing them into accepting poor pay and conditions \u2013 and debt \u2013 because they have no alternative. In Britain, since the crash, something grotesque has happened. Government tax credits have pretty much been replaced by unsecured loans. It\u2019s one of the more counterintuitive privatisations to have come in the wake of the banking crisis, and it has happened in a fairly covert and atomised way. Result? The UK is, again, still very much a place where the rich get ever richer and the poor get ever poorer. \u2022 Deborah Orr is a Guardian columnist"
"8||Air passengers face delays due to strikes and tighter border controlsHolidaymakers could face long delays as a result of industrial action at some Spanish airports and tighter border controls across Europe on one of the busiest weekends of the year. Airlines have advised passengers to allow extra time and prepare for long delays, while one travel organisation said the elderly and young should take special precautions. Aage Duenhaupt, a spokesman for A4E, which represents airlines including BA\u2019s owner, International Airlines Group, Ryanair and easyJet, said: \u201cThere is a danger people could get ill if we are looking at the worst-case scenario. Passengers need to be prepared for long queues and keep hydrated.\u201d The intermittent delays follow the introduction in March of EU regulations in the wake of the Paris and Brussels terror attacks. The new rules demand both entry and exit checks on passengers from countries \u2013 including Britain \u2013 outside the 26-nation Schengen border-free zone. Thousands of flights have already been delayed due to the long queues at passport control. A spokesman for the travel trade organisation ABTA said: \u201cThe advice we are giving is for travellers to bear in mind they need to leave extra time when departing from Schengen countries as the queues will be longer than normal. There will be a record number of people traveling this weekend and with the new requirements they will need to head to passport control earlier than in the past.\u201d Passengers\u2019 details are checked against several databases \u2013 such as the Schengen information system and Interpol\u2019s record of stolen and lost travel documents. Member states are not obliged to check every non-Schengen passport until October, when regulation EU 2017/458 comes into full force, but several airports are already doing so and others are carrying out spot checks on selected flights. Duenhaupt said: \u201cSpain, France and Portgual have all put in place new regulations and people have complained about long delays at Palma, Malaga, Lisbon and Brussels, but the big crunch day is Saturday. These new regulations are only going to work if there are people manning all the booths in passport control. These preparations have not been done properly.\u201d However, airlines and tour operators suggested the problems were not widespread, and delays were not always due to immigration issues. A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: \u201cOn transfers we are bringing in customers slightly earlier and have told independent travellers booking seat-only flights to come in plenty of time.\u201d The spokesman said holiday airports were coping well because they were used to being busy over summer, but city airports were having more issues. \u201cThey are finding it more of a challenge. But if people come on a package with us we are not going to leave them behind.\u201d Ryanair is advising all customers to arrive in plenty of time for their flights, saying it is each customer\u2019s responsibility to ensure they are on time. \u201cOur operations across the network are running as normal and we continue to advise customers to arrive at least three hours before the scheduled departure time of their flight,\u201d it said. EasyJet is also advising passengers to allow extra time to get through security to ensure they arrive at the departure gate on time. July passenger numbers released on Friday showed the budget airline was forced to cancel 541 flights last month, a sharp increase on the 350 flights cancelled in the same month last year. About 100 of the cancellations were due to disruption caused by a burst tyre as an Air Canada plane took off from Gatwick. The rest was down to bad weather and air traffic control or technical issues. British Airways said: \u201cWe\u2019re texting customers flying from airports that we know are having issues to ask them to arrive early. If customers miss their flight because of the queues we will of course rebook them for free.\u201d Security staff in Spain are also taking industrial action, which has added to the problems. They are planning a work-to-rule, which will involve using the maximum of 10 minutes to pass each passenger through security, and hour-long strikes at the busiest times of day. The protest is about low pay, working conditions and staff numbers. Josh Engleman, a spokesman for the tour operator Monarch, said: \u201cThere is industrial action planned at Barcelona and Malaga airports. We are making our customers aware this is happening and advising them to get to the airport in time and check in early to allow time to get through security at these airports. We have been alerted that these are the two areas where there may be disruption.\u201d"
"1||England v South Africa: fourth Test, day one \u2013 as it happened90th over: England 260-6 (Bairstow 33, Roland-Jones 0) Bairstow takes two boundaries off Olivier\u2019s final over of the day - a thumping extra-cover drive followed by an attempted leave that scuttles through the slip cordon. That\u2019s the end of a belting day\u2019s cricket, in which both sides played Pass The Initiative (or, to be more accurate, Grab The Initiative Back Through Very Good Cricket, but that doesn\u2019t have the same ring). The late wicket of Ben Stokes makes it South Africa\u2019s day, just about, though there is little in it. Thanks for your company, night. 89th over: England 252-6 (Bairstow 25, Roland-Jones 0) That was devastating bowling from Rabada. It\u2019s the mark of a champion to take a key wicket at the end of a hard day, and he has done exactly that. Oh yes yes yes. This is magnificent from Kagiso Rabada! Stokes hit him for two fours earlier in the over, and Rabada responded by slamming a yorker into the base of off stump. It would have been brilliant at any time of day - but in context, his last delivery of a long day to dismiss Ben Stokes, it\u2019s an absolute gem. 88th over: England 244-5 (Stokes 50, Bairstow 25) A surprising late change from Faf du Plessis, who has decided to replace Morkel with Dame Judi Dench Duanne Olivier. That said, it\u2019s a good over from Olivier: he curves one sharply back into Bairstow, who defends, and then induces s a loosish drive that goes for a couple. \u201cIf anyone is genuinely experiencing bad shampoo moments I can pass on my doctor\u2019s advice,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cUse a children\u2019s shampoo like No More Tears. This has an advantage of being usable often, so it can cope with at least every other day, a boon for us bearded people.\u201d 87th over: England 242-5 (Stokes 50, Bairstow 23) Rabada beats Bairstow with a monstrous delivery that swings in a fraction and then bursts the other way off the pitch. He does it again two balls later. How many times?! Morkel and Rabada have been desperately unlucky. 86th over: England 241-5 (Stokes 50, Bairstow 22) Bairstow chases a wide outswinger from Morkel that beats the outside edge and is pushed for four byes by the diving de Kock. That brings up a respectful fifty partnership. \u201cBeard oil?\u201d sniffs Andrew Benton. \u201cI was the proud owner of a completely uncontrollable beard in my mid and late 20s - shampoo\u2019d it every day - lovely and soft. Should have been called Head\u2019n\u2019Shoulders\u2019n\u2019Chin\u2019n\u2019Cheeks.\u201d Singular? 85th over: England 234-5 (Stokes 50, Bairstow 19) There\u2019s a quiet intensity to these last few overs. Both teams know the difference between 260 for five and 240 for eight, and so do the crowd. At the moment England are hanging on for the close, with Rabada zipping another excellent delivery past Stokes\u2019s defensive stroke. Stokes then pushes two down the ground to reach another mature, determined fifty from 89 balls. This really has been an excellent day\u2019s cricket. \u201cAs an image-conscious teenager, I made the mistake of shampooing my eyebrows in the misguided hope it would give them some extra sparkle,\u201d says Tom van der Gucht. \u201cInstead, not only did I have to endure the agony of all the foam rinsing directly onto my eyeballs - giving me a bit of a conjunctivitis vibe - but the Wash and Go also managed to irritate my sensitive skin and left me with what appeared to be eyebrow dandruff for a couple of weeks.\u201d 84th over: England 232-5 (Stokes 48, Bairstow 19) Stokes has a wild drive at Morkel and is beaten again. On Sky, Mike Atherton tells us that\u2019s the 19th time he\u2019s beaten the outside edge today. That\u2019s about once every five deliveries. 83rd over: England 229-5 (Stokes 47, Bairstow 17) Kagiso Rabada beats both batsmen outside off stump, and then Stokes drags a pull onto the fleshy part of the thigh. He smashes his bat into the pitch in annoyance, but has cooled down sufficiently to flick the next ball very classily through midwicket for three. I think Stokes is being told off by Aleem Dar for that bat thump, which is a bit ridiculous if so. \u201cI presume Sachin Paul is a W.Indies fan (i.e. England\u2019s next test opponents) if he describes Joe Root\u2019s form as \u2018worrying\u2019,\u201d says Jonathan Gresty. \u201cHasn\u2019t Root scored at least a half-century in all of his last ten Tests? Isn\u2019t he comfortably the highest scoring batsman in either team in this series so far? I personally find Donald Trump, overpopulation and galloping climate change worrying. It\u2019s 37 degrees where I live (Slovakia), it\u2019s too hot to even leave the house, I\u2019m waiting for N. Korea to start turning their nukes to face the US and amidst it all, Joe Root\u2019s reliability at the crease is proving to be one source of comfort in this ever-changing, unstable world of ours.\u201d 82nd over: England 225-5 (Stokes 44, Bairstow 16) Morne Morkel takes the second new ball. He immediately snaps a beauty past Stokes\u2019s defensive stoke and then finds an edge that flies over the vacant third-slip area for four. Ach! Morkel has been so unlucky in this series. There are lies, damned lies and 14 wickets at 30.00. He could easily have more than 20 wicket. He\u2019s been an absolute joy, as a bloke and a bowler. Here\u2019s Robert Wilson. \u201cRe. Over 74. Imagine sledging Viv! Has there ever been a less promising target? That desultory but regal walk to the middle, the faux-casual stance and the infinite disdain of that gum-chewing jawline (a more difficult combo than most people realise). Has there ever been a batsman who so effectively posed that most important of questions to a bowler \u2013 \u2018Remind me, who the eff are you again?\u2019\u201d I\u2019m sorry I assumed that was a rhetorical question. 81st over: England 220-5 (Stokes 40, Bairstow 15) After some unexplained faffing that lasts two or three, Maharaj continues. Stokes has to abort a couple of attacking strokes - first because he\u2019s beaten in the flight, then because of some nasty bounces. Maharaj has been admirable today. 80th over: England 220-5 (Stokes 40, Bairstow 15) Another time-killing over from de Bruyn. The second new ball is available but South Africa aren\u2019t going to take it, at least not yet. 79th over: England 219-5 (Stokes 39, Bairstow 15) Bairstow misses a sweep at Maharaj but accidentally hits it in his follow through, with the ball whistling past de Kock for a couple of runs. \u201cHow come none of the OBO team were asked about this?\u201d says Charlie Tinsley. \u201cThere\u2019s a distinct lack of 92 World Cup cricket shirts and bucket hats...\u201d Exactly. When it comes to fashion, I think we\u2019ve all had enough of experts, don\u2019t you. 78th over: England 217-5 (Stokes 39, Bairstow 13) de Bruyn tries to tempt Stokes into something feckless outside off stump. It must be uniquely exasperating to get out to a part-time dobber just before the second new ball. Stokes almost experiences the sensation when he drags a leg-side flick this far wide of leg stump. 77th over: England 215-5 (Stokes 38, Bairstow 12) Maharaj continues to give South Africa control of the scoreboard. It\u2019s a reflection of his accuracy and occasional variety that England\u2019s glory boys have barely played an attacking stroke against him. \u201cMore impatience from Root,\u201d sniffs Sachin Paul. \u201cWhy can\u2019t he knuckle down and do justice to his talent by converting these starts into huge scores? It\u2019s been happening since the India tour and doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. Worrying.\u201d 76th over: England 214-5 (Stokes 37, Bairstow 12) Dobbly or not dobbly? That\u2019s the question for Faf du Plessis, who answers in the affirmative by bringing on the gentle medium-pacer Theunis de Bruyn. He starts with a wide full toss that Stokes dismisses from his presence for four runs. It was a no-ball too. That aside, it was a triumph. \u201cThere\u2019s a shampoo-related thread running through today\u2019s OBO,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that at some point Hashim Amla, Moeen Ali and Aleem Dar will combine for a decision. Imagine the beard-power there! It\u2019d take a very large shampoo bottle to sort out the possible tangles.\u201d Shampoo? Beard oil, John, please. This is the Guardian. 75th over: England 206-5 (Stokes 32, Bairstow 10) After a few unsatisfying defensive stroke, Bairstow whacks an impatient sweep for four off Maharaj. 74th over: England 202-5 (Stokes 32, Bairstow 6) A few technical problems. You have\u2019t missed much, just an indecisive dab at fresh air by Bairstow off Olivier. We are amid the calm before the second new ball. \u201cI have been waiting for years for a thread on piles to emerge so I can ask others if they recall Viv Richards being abused from the stands at a county game over his own suffering from said affliction,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cI guess in English humour any pain in the arse region is cause both for ridicule and aspersions against one\u2019s manhood. On this occasion Sir Viv invited the person to step forward and debate the issue with him one to one.\u201d It would take a brave person to repeat Greg Thomas\u2019s sledge in the circumstances. It\u2019s red, it\u2019s round... 73rd over: England 201-5 (Stokes 32, Bairstow 5) It\u2019s a good thing there\u2019s no yellow jersey in cricket, because half the time you wouldn\u2019t know who should receive it. I have no idea who\u2019s winning here. Here\u2019s Andrew Benton. \u201cIs your online persona of a nice guy a reflection of your in vivo persona?\u201d Course not. That\u2019s the whole point of the internet, right? 72nd over: England 200-5 (Stokes 32, Bairstow 4) What happened, I think, was this: Kumar Dharmasena gave the LBW appeal not out and then, while South Africa were reviewing, was told by the square-leg umpire Aleem Dar that he thought the ball had carried to slip. Dharmasena thus gave Bairstow out before he was persuaded to go upstairs to make sure it had carried. Back to the live cricket. Stokes, who is again batting with considerable authority, carves Olivier through backward point for four more. 71st over: England 196-5 (Stokes 28, Bairstow 4) After all that, it\u2019s a maiden from Maharaj to Bairstow. He has bowled brilliantly, especially for a spinner on day one: 24-8-46-1. This is all very strange. Bairstow pushes at Maharaj, with South Africa appealing for LBW and maybe a catch at slip. It\u2019s given not out, so South Africa review. Then, before it goes upstairs, Bairstow is given out! I\u2019m not sure what happened there. Eventually it does to go to the third umpire, a referral rather than a review. Replays show a huge inside edge but cast enough doubt as to whether Elgar got his hands under the ball for it to be given not out. Elgar thought it was a clean catch and it may well have been; once that goes upstairs, the batsman usually survives. 70th over: England 196-5 (Stokes 28, Bairstow 4) A wide ball from Olivier is driven beautifully through extra cover for four by Stokes. It\u2019s rare to see a batsman who can be quite so elegant and quite so brutal. At the moment he looks better on the pitch than on paper, but there has been such clear progression in his batting in the last two years that he could be unstoppable by the age of 28. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Edmund King. \u201cNone of them appears to involve shampoo (nasty substance), but there\u2019s a good list of off-beat (but no doubt still excruciating) cricket injuries here. It includes NZ opener Trevor Franklin being mown down and injured rather badly by a luggage truck at Gatwick in 1986 and poor Jimmy Adams cutting his hand open on an inflight meal in the late \u201890s.\u201d Trevor Franklin got the luggage truck, and every cricket fan in England, back when he batted something like 19 hours for a century at Lord\u2019s in 1990. 69th over: England 192-5 (Stokes 24, Bairstow 4) The five England batsmen dismissed all scored between 17 and 52, which is often a bigger sin than getting a duck. The Friday Feeling has been FFS, because all five will feel they should have got more. That said, South Africa have bowled some extremely good stuff in spells. 68th over: England 191-5 (Stokes 23, Bairstow 4) England had two reviews left, so it was worth a try just in case Root was outside the line or Hawkeye malfunctioned and confirmed it was missing wibble stump. It looked plumb, however, and so it was. This has been an excellent comeback from Olivier after a desperate one-over spell straight after tea. In other news, Bairstow gets off the mark with a confident clip to the square-leg boundary. \u201cHey there Rob,\u201d says Tumi. \u201cHust got reports that South Africa is in talks with Ottis Gibson so i was wondering if you could kindly confirm this. PS a shout out on the commentary timeline would be amazing. I am a South African reader.\u201d I don\u2019t know anything about that, though I haven\u2019t broken a story in my life so I\u2019m not the best person to ask. We don\u2019t usually do shout-outs \u2013 this is the Guardian, darling \u2013 but it\u2019s the weekend and I\u2019m trying to cultivate the online persona of a nice guy, so: shout-out to Tumi! Yes, Root has gone. He walked down and across to Olivier before missing a flick around his front pad. He was hit in line and the ball would have gone on to hit the meat of leg stump. Out of nothing, a huge wicket for South Africa. Root is given out LBW! He has reviewed it, but I think he knows he\u2019s out. 67th over: England 187-4 (Root 52, Stokes 23) Stokes drives Maharaj safely down the ground for a single, one of two from the over. He\u2019s playing low-risk cricket at the moment, certainly against Maharaj. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Ben Heywood. \u201cLast year, having driven 220km to take part in a cricket tournament in Split, Croata (I live in Montenegro), I somehow managed to injure myself over breakfast before the first game. Watching our skipper stretching an arm behind his back, I subconsciously followed suit while eating my Coco Pops and the unexpected manoeuvre pinged a nerve in my neck, basically ruling me out of the whole shebang and landing me with the kind of nickname - Coco - that ought really to belong to a dog. Or a clown, I suppose.\u201d 66th over: England 185-4 (Root 51, Stokes 22) A maiden from Olivier to Root. He has been much more accurate since switching ends. He has a vigorous, bustling action which reminds me a bit of the brilliant Fanie de Villiers. 65th over: England 185-4 (Root 51, Stokes 22) Another desperate LBW appeal from South Africa when Stokes misses a sweep at Maharaj. He was well outside the line. Maharaj is bowling nicely though, particularly to Stokes. \u201cPeople (sometimes understandably) complain when England go too hard and fall in a heap,\u201d says Phil Harrison. \u201cBut they should also acknowledge the flip-side of that tendency - England are now a superb counter-attacking team on their day. Since tea, they\u2019ve totally reversed the momentum of this game, not just with stroke-play but with aggressive running and general positive intent. This could be the series-winning stand. It\u2019s great to watch too and that\u2019s what it\u2019s ultimately all about.\u201d Yes, agreed. This partnership reminds me a little of Johannesburg 2016. Root is our best top-order counter-attack since Graham Thorpe, I think. 64th over: England 183-4 (Root 50, Stokes 21) Olivier has switched ends to replace Morkel. I\u2019d be very surprised if England don\u2019t try to belt him round Manchester, as that would give du Plessis a problem. Root flicks him for a single to reach the usual fifty; it\u2019s the 10th Test in a row that he has scored at least one half-century. \u201cI think I\u2019ve figured out to whom Kim Thonger (61st over) is referring,\u201d says Andy Plowman, \u201cand I\u2019m sorry to point out why the officials would have a problem with that, but I just can\u2019t see how \u201cThe Sledgehammer of Eternal Justice Pavilion\u201d would fit on the hoardings.\u201d 63rd over: England 181-4 (Root 49, Stokes 20) Stokes misses a fierce sweep at Maharaj, prompting a big appeal for LBW. He was well outside the line. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cFirst time I\u2019ve been able to email the OBO from the ground in a good few years. An anniversary present from Mrs McMahon, tickets to the first two days. And only one with her, she\u2019s letting me take a pal tomorrow. Not that she\u2019s not, if you know what I mean. The weather has held too. A great day of Test cricket, with Root and Stokes together in the middle. Is there anything better?\u201d Root and Stokes counter-attacking in the middle? They are going at almost a run a ball in this partnership. 62nd over: England 180-4 (Root 48, Stokes 20) Root drives Morkel nicely for three to move past 5,000 Test runs. This is his 105th innings, which makes him the fastest Englishman to reach the milestone since the great Kenny Barrington in the 1960s. \u201cIs there any worse feeling in cricket than being dismissed by a bowler early in his spell, who then turns out to be the worst on the park by a very, very large margin,\u201d says Robin Hobbs. \u201cIn fairness I think we knew this after his performance in the second Test. Anyway, Jennings must be disconsolate.\u201d I\u2019ll give you disconsolate: Grahame Clinton after this match. 61st over: England 172-4 (Root 45, Stokes 15) Olivier is hooked after a single over, with Maharaj replacing him. Stokes, pushing at an outdrifter, edges wide of slip for three. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cJust idly wondering during tea if the powers that be at Warwickshire CCC might follow Lancashire CCC\u2019s example and rename an end at Edgbaston after one of their well-known players?\u201d You can probably work out which Edgbaston stalwart Kim suggested. 60th over: England 165-4 (Root 44, Stokes 9) England have come out after tea in counter-attacking mode, presumably under instruction from the captain and vice-captain. Root chases a couple of wide tempters from Morkel - one fullish, one short - and is beaten on both occasions. And now he has edged straight between keeper and first slip! They both left it to each other. Oh my, what a let-off. It was definitely de Kock\u2019s catch. He dived twice as far to catch Tom Westley earlier in the day. It was a great delivery from Morkel, swinging away to take the edge, and de Kock just ushered it to the boundary. \u201cBoth Phil Sawyer and Vernon Philander have my sympathy,\u201d says David Hopkins. \u201cI recently put my neck out through the athletic activity of applying shampoo in the shower. Not exactly the same as Test fast bowling I\u2019ll admit, although very much in the same ballpark.\u201d You\u2019re no Sanath Jayasuriya: he once dislocated his shoulder reaching for the shampoo and missed the remainder of a tour to New Zealand. He was ridiculed, as he was nearly bald at the time, though us members of the bald community know those sideburns won\u2019t cleanse themselves. 59th over: England 161-4 (Root 40, Stokes 9) Maharaj is replaced by Olivier, who dismissed Keaton Jennings earlier in the day. Who did you think will replace Jennings for the West Indies series, assuming he fails in the second innings? It must be tempting to go back to Hameed, and the hell with his form, but I\u2019d hold fire. Play the long game rather than risk significant damage in Australia this winter. Anyway, Olivier\u2019s first over is a pile of malodorous pucky that disappears for 13. His first ball is a Grade A loosener, a wide, swinging half-volley that Root slams through the covers for four; Stokes then hits him for consecutive boundaries, helping some rubbish to fine leg before clipping an attempted yorker through midwicket. There is a suggestion that South Africa are hiding Maharaj from Stokes, which is bizarre if true, certainly at this stage of the match and Stokes\u2019s innings. \u201cIt seems there is no official designation for the fielding position between deep point and third man currently being used to collect Root\u2019s shots in that area,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cPerhaps this can be put out to tender: this fielding position brought to you into association with Thatchers, we destroyed the industrial base in the north and now have gone into cider.\u201d 58th over: England 148-4 (Root 35, Stokes 1) Morne Morkel, the genial giant who makes Test cricket and the world a better place, bowls the first over after tea. Root back cuts the first ball for a single, and Mature Ben plays carefully for the remainder of the over. His Test batting average is 34 is higher than those of Sir Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff and should continue to rise. In many ways he is a classical batsman. \u201cThe late Simon Gray once wrote on the significance of piles in the course of history,\u201d says Pete Wood. \u201cBear with me here. He relates how Gary Cooper was suffering from agonising haemorrhoids during the filming of High Noon; hence that stoical, manly look of repressed suffering wasn\u2019t all acting.\u201d Given Tony Soprano\u2019s obsession with Gary Cooper, that puts a whole new spin on this famous scene. (NB: contains language that may offend, etc.) Whatever happened to Gary Cooper department \u201cI gave myself a back spasm the other day just by trying to scratch between my shoulders blades,\u201d says Phil Sawyer. \u201cObviously, Vernon Philander is not as monumentally out of shape as me, but a warning to us all nonetheless. Whether that\u2019s a warning about the dangers of scratching between your shoulder blades or about being monumentally out of shape, I\u2019ll leave to your reader to decide.\u201d 57th over: England 147-4 (Root 34, Stokes 1) The paradox of England v South Africa is that we invariably get a close series yet we rarely get a close match. This is shaping up promisingly to be the exception, after a splendid session for South Africa: they took three wickets for 80 in 28 overs, and it could have been more. See you in 20 minutes for what should be a compelling final session. 56th over: England 144-4 (Root 32, Stokes 0) That was the last ball of the over. England are one or two wickets away from a world of pain. Morkel moves over the wicket to Malan, who is less comfortable with that angle - and the move works immediately. Malan launches into a big drive at a wide delivery angled across him and edges straight to du Plessis at second slip. That\u2019s a loose stroke - the ball didn\u2019t deviate - and a bonus wicket for South Africa just before tea. 55th over: England 142-3 (Root 31, Malan 18) Malan drives Maharaj for a single to bring up a solid fifty partnership. Root, not for the first time in the innings, tries an aggressive stroke against Maharaj and doesn\u2019t time it. He\u2019s a very slippery bowler, hard to go after. \u201cDo you have the skinny on what caused Philander to ail so severely?\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cHe really has been in the wars both back, front and presumably down under. Glenn McGrath stepping on a ball was clearly self-inflicted but I wonder if Philander was invited to sample some bland English food and could not stomach it.\u201d Not gonna happen, mate. (I have no idea, though it\u2019s a back spasm that has kept him out of this match. You can probably get those from English food as well.) 54th over: England 141-3 (Root 31, Malan 17) Malan flicks Morkel fine for four, not far wide of the diving de Kock. England have done well because they could have unravelled had Root gone early to Rabada. This partnership is 49 from 14 overs. 53rd over: England 134-3 (Root 30, Malan 11) 52nd over: England 133-3 (Root 30, Malan 10) Root guides Morkel past gully for four, a lovely stroke. He is starting to race along now. A big score from Root is usually good news for England - only four players who have played at least 20 Test innings have a higher average in Test victories. \u201cKudos for Adam\u2019s pick of Arcade Fire for the lunchtime break, but it is indeed sad that a member of the public was taken ill and for all I admire your choice of Larkin on ambulances, I am drawn to the bleak commentary from Leeds\u2019 The Wind-Up Birds and their track Two Ambulance Day,\u201d says James Walsh. \u201c\u2019I pretend I\u2019ve not noticed, It\u2019s easier to look away\u2019. Maybe it is in keeping of my mood, the sun is shining, the cricket is on auto-refresh and someone has Sun FM on the office stereo.\u201d This will always be the best song with Ambulance in the title, surely. 51st over: England 127-3 (Root 24, Malan 10) Maharaj has given South Africa control all day. Root is itching to get after him, both through boundaries and stolen singles, but there is very little to work with. One from the over. 50th over: England 126-3 (Root 23, Malan 10) Morkel replaces Rabada, who bowled heroically in an attempt to eliminate Root and put South Africa in charge. Malan clips a single to move into double figures. He looks calm and settled, despite that double failure at the Oval. If he gets in, this afternoon will be a lot of fun. He has 10 from 29 balls; Root, after a slow start, has 23 from 43. \u201cJust to let you know it was nine years ago yesterday that Graeme Smith was shovelling to leg to get to the 154* that broke Michael Vaughan at Edgbaston,\u201d says Andy Bradshaw. \u201cOh and my son Dylan was nine. Time flies, eh?\u201d Ah, a belated happy birthday Dylan! Also, I love that you instantly associate the birth of your son with an England defeat. 49th over: England 124-3 (Root 22, Malan 9) Maharaj really hurries through his overs, which isn\u2019t doing your ageing OBOer any favours. Nothing of note happened, and it was a maiden to Root. 48th over: England 124-3 (Root 22, Malan 9) Rabada tries to flatten Malan with the demon yorker for the second Test in a row. It isn\u2019t quite as full, and doesn\u2019t swing, so Malan is able to dig it out. The Sky chaps have pointed out that he has opened up his stance slightly in this match, having struggled at the Oval with the ball coming back into him. \u201cIf Root gets the 46 runs he needs to reach 5000 Test runs in this match he\u2019ll have got to that mark in fewer games than, among others, Tendulkar, Lara, Viv Richards, Wally Hammond and Kumar Sangakkara,\u201d says Phil Harrison. \u201cHe\u2019s right up there with the greats, isn\u2019t he?\u201d I\u2019d say he\u2019s just below that quartet at the moment, though I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he finished his career alongside them. It was close, but not close enough. The ball was hitting the top of the bails, which means it stays with Aleem Dar\u2019s on-field decision: Root is not out. Rabada continues to trouble Root, this time with a sharp breakback that hits him on the kneeroll. This will be close. 47th over: England 121-3 (Root 19, Malan 9) I missed that Maharaj over, and I don\u2019t know why. I think I was looking at emails. 46th over: England 120-3 (Root 18, Malan 9) Malan throws his hands at a wide half-volley from Rabada, belting it through extra cover for four. Whatever happens in his Test career - and the smart money is on a short one at this stage - I doubt he\u2019ll die wondering. He launches into another drive later in the over, but the ball isn\u2019t so full and he\u2019s beaten. \u201cIn honour of the person crocked and the medical services (God bless the NHS),\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201chere\u2019s Larkin on ambulances: Closed like confessionals, they thread Loud noons of cities, giving back None of the glances they absorb. Light glossy grey, arms on a plaque, They come to rest at any kerb: All streets in time are visited. 45th over: England 116-3 (Root 18, Malan 5) This is only Maharaj\u2019s 11th Test but he already looks like South Africa\u2019s best Test spinner since readmission, maybe even since Hugh Tayfield. Drift is his main weapon here, it being the first day, and that dig for Cook earlier in the session. Root premeditates a lap for four to make it seven from the over. 44th over: England 109-3 (Root 14, Malan 2) Rabada bowls the last two balls of the over that he started before drinks. Batsmen are often vulnerable after a delay, and Root is lucky to edge a loose drive wide of second slip for four. This has been a very scratchy start to his innings, primarily because of some terrific bowling from Rabada. An ambulance has arrived, and play is about to resume. Thanks Adam, hello all. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this at a cricket match. On Sky, David Gower tells us that the spectator being treated has regained consciousness. 43.4 overs: England 105-3 (Root 10, Malan 2). We have an early drinks in the middle of this over of Rabada with something happening in the crowd behind the bowler. A health issue, so they are being cautious. It might be a bit longer as paramedics are involved. Before that, outstanding again to Root to begin, a very good shout for lbw but saved by a slight inside edge. Then it happens again the inside edge likely the only thing saving Root. That\u2019s not got up either. At this point there is the lengthy delay, with two balls to go in the over. At this point, might be a good time to pass the baton to the great Rob Smyth. Thanks for the good times through the course of the first three hours of this Test. A great little battle. I\u2019ll see you again on Sunday morning. Until then, be well. 43rd over: England 103-3 (Root 8, Malan 2). Now they\u2019re moving. Malan gets off the mark with a push to cover. Not fluent, but it\u2019ll do. Root gets his first runs in far more elegant fashion to the next ball, crunching a rare overpitched Maharaj delivery to the cover rope. Oh, but he gets the edge next ball! A lot going on. Doesn\u2019t go to slip. Lucky. Malan keeps the strike with three behind point to end the set, carving from deep in the crease. 100 is up as well. Will Wiles has been thinking about the Beefy interview and has some deeper analysis than \u2018bloody hell, this is funny\u2019. I\u2019ll give to you in full. Fair points raised. \u201cWe all crave an equal contest between bat and ball. What the loyal Botham-ites and the haters alike neglect to mention is that this interview is the epitome of this. Unfair questions and ridiculous answers are as prevalent as a commendably open stance from a great maverick in addressing every googly and bouncer the Scottish youth throw at him in their attempt to topple the hero of an English toffs game. He makes a tit of himself, but at no stage does he appear to resent their attacks seeking to explain his views, sometimes with little grace but at no stage with any less than total honesty. He defends their right to every opinion however ridiculous. The man\u2019s got a code and he sticks by it.\u201d 42nd over: England 93-3 (Root 0, Malan 0). A superb over from Rabada to Root. The captain lucky to get to the end of it. There\u2019s a confident lbw shout, Root caught deep in the crease from a ball cutting back a long way. Good decision to turn it down (and not review) as it is going over. There\u2019s an inside edge, a couple of short balls, then another ripper to end it with Root\u2019s edge beaten. 15 balls he\u2019s faced without getting off the mark, Malan nine balls for the same. Feels like South Africa have a big chance to set up this Test Match right now. 41st over: England 93-3 (Root 0, Malan 0). Maharaj the man to keep the pressure up here, to Malan he has his range, changing the pace ball to ball. He tries to get down the track but unsuccessfully. 10-6-9-1. Beautiful set of numbers for the spinner so far. Final word on Botham and Brent from Ben Parker, who believes he has the convlusive evidence. 40th over: England 93-3 (Root 0, Malan 0). Rabada has found the heeeat. Through Malan immediately between inside edge and off-stump. The same man he did with a supreme yorker at The Oval last week, so no surprise that he fancies that from the get go again. A big of pad to another yorker ends the over, turning the strike over but it is still a wicket maiden. Rabada battled a bit earlier but he back in business now with two England batsmen yet to score. What a catch! Rabada wins the edge of Westley who is stuck on the crease pushing when he should have been leaving in a perfect world. But it is the take by de Kock, diving full-length to his right with the one mitt, in front of Amla at first slip. Total commitment from the \u2018keeper and he\u2019s rewarded with one for his highlights reel. Big quarter-hour for South Africa, removing both the established batsmen. 39th over: England 92-2 (Westley 29, Root 0). Warne and Botham on the commentary. Don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned. Maharaj another quality maiden, this time to Root. The captain doesn\u2019t leave his defensive posture throughout. Nine overs for nine runs when the spinner has been in operation, and that\u2019s his fifth maiden. 38th over: England 92-2 (Westley 29, Root 0). Rabada getting his first go at Westley. Negotiated well, acknowledging that with the captain yet to score up the other end his job changes again. Robert Coates\u2019 not captures the consensus of those that have flooded in since Cook fell: \u201cAnd who\u2019s fault was that Mr \u201call of a sudden, doing it easy, hm??\u201d It\u2019s Mitch Marsh who cops it from me. I\u2019ve burned him on the OBO. On the radio (mulitple times). On twitter. It\u2019s only because I\u2019m so fond of him. Unpopular as it is to say that these days. 37th over: England 92-2 (Westley 29, Root 0). Well, I\u2019ve mozzed Cook then. Sorry about that. Let the email flow. Should have known better. The captain to the crease, who plundered 254 here last time around. The most complete innings I\u2019ve covered. Revisited it in a thing recently. Where\u2019s that from? Cook was in superb shape after lunch, but he\u2019s made an error, chasing after a fuller Maharaj delivery outside the off-stump but instead of crashing it to the boundary has got a little edge. The chance taken by de Kock. It\u2019s lovely flight again by the spinner, and a really good catch too. And that\u2019s his day done. 36th over: England 91-1 (Cook 46, Westley 28). Rabada\u2019s back. Cook cuts with great timing, three for that behind point. Westley clips again through midwicket. All of a sudden, doing it easy. 35th over: England 85-1 (Cook 43, Westley 25). Maharaj doing a lot right to Westley. The man most likely to the number three, I would say. Gives it a chance to spin, forces him to play at everything. High-quality maiden. Nicolas Clarke agrees that Botham = Brent. \u201cThere is now more deer in this country since Henry VIII. Fact.\u201d The head nod on fact is perfectly timed.\u201d And Bob Miller\u2019s all over Matt Doherty\u2019s OBO red meat from last over. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there are any Macbeth\u2019s eligible for England but when we had Gavin Hamilton in the side he was the Scottish Play and Miss.\u201d 34th over: England 85-1 (Cook 43, Westley 25). A couple for Cook through his beloved midwicket area brings up 50 between these two. Not a lot of glitz, but plenty of grit. Cook launches into a drive but it is stopped at cover point. Made a fantastic ton on the opening day at Old Trafford last year. Don\u2019t want to mozz him, but well on the way to another here today. Batted out of his skin that afternoon, as I recall. \u201cWith Olivier bowling for South Africa should our batting line-up include Hamlet and Richard the Third,\u201d writes Matt Doherty. 33rd over: England 83-1 (Cook 41, Westley 25). Westley\u2019s first runs of the session to the right of slip, an edge along the ground but well bowled Maharaj to draw him forward. The bowler on top throughout, but utter class from Westley to finish with a flick through midwicket. You\u2019re going to hear/read plenty of that while he features in this England team. 32nd over: England 77-1 (Cook 41, Westley 19). Cook breaks it open just as the sun bursts through at Old Trafford. Ten from the over, the biggest of the day. Olivier offers a long half-volley to begin, the former captain licks his lips. Two more in a similar direction half way through the set. Then to finish he backs himself to pull a ball that isn\u2019t all that short, but middles it behind square with his front leg in the air and everything. Chef Gone Wild. Stuart MacKenzie giving us something to look at later on: \u201cI loved that reminder of Scottish schoolkids giving Ian Botham a hard time. Think lots of people who went on that programme had a shock at the stern questioning, I recall Ben Elton looking close to tears. Exception was Billy Connolly who took over the show and turned it into a stand-up routine.\u201d I urge you all to look at the Botham vid if you haven\u2019t, from my rambling lunchtime post. As others have noted, surely that\u2019s where Gervais found his inspiration for David Brent. 31st over: England 67-1 (Cook 31, Westley 19). Maharaj through his paces to Westley. It\u2019s back to back maidens to start the session - four on the spin either side of the break. Haseeb Hameed is up in the viewing room sitting with Joe Root. Someone better create a \u2018you vs the guy she said not to worry about\u2019 meme about that image and Jennings. Vish clearly the man for that job. I\u2019ll sort. 30th over: England 67-1 (Cook 31, Westley 19). Olivier from the Jimmy End. Speaking of nicknames, really hope he\u2019s Laurence to his teammates. A few World at War references from the cordon. No? Patrick Brennan on the email is says looks like Luis Suarez. Maybe so. I think we can all agree on one thing: he\u2019s a very good looking rooster. And he can bowl a bit, pushing away from Cook who patiently watches and defends from the crease. Athers and Bumble chatting about what Old Trafford once looked like in their day on the telly. Speaking of how Manchester appeared way back when, the Morrissey biopic is out today. Soon as I\u2019m done here I\u2019m off to the cinema, needless to say. Correspondence I didn\u2019t get around to. Let\u2019s whip through it... Ben Parker with a follow-up: \u201cDon\u2019t you think Olivier looks like a character on Band Of Brothers? Tall, public-schooly, stubbly and fairly handsome. I think he would have been regularly admonished for his untucked shirt but he\u2019d have been admired throughout the platoon for his grenade bowling skills.\u201d Rugged, the word you\u2019re looking for. And yes. Alisdair Gould on the rain - or lack thereof: \u201cSince when did Manchester have a unique type of rain? I live abroad because of the depressing band of cities from Liverpool to Hull. Should I refer to \u2018the Rain you get from the roundabout to your flat upto the field with the donkey in\u2019 when enquiring of the weather to a friend? \u200e\u2019 When asked why I moved, I just pull a face and say the weather was fu++in+ awful.\u201d You\u2019ve touched a (tangential) nerve of mine. What is it with local knowledge and weather? Since when did living somewhere for a long time turn you into a meteorologist? Garbage. Richard Williams has just found the greatest youtube link on all the world wide web: I\u2019m late to the party as I only just discovered this Ian Botham interview this week from 1986. Incase I wasn\u2019t the last person in the world to see it, it really is a cracking watch.\u201d I\u2019m most of the 73,000 hits on this clip. Enjoy quoting it all back at me. Edward Thompson off the long-run: \u201cI\u2019ve just seen Paddy \u201cWoe is me\u201d Ford\u2019s (aka Smuggy McSmugface) email about the hardship of going to the Waca and snoozing by the pool.I mean, I really feel his pain as I sit at work, watching the rain pour down over Bath. Please send him my deepest sympathies that he\u2019s having such a hard time.\u201d He then did a swear. I took that out. That\u2019s editing. Andy Brown likes that I still ask for ice cream cake: \u201cOoh, that\u2019s good. I still get Battenberg house cakes for mine (wrong side of 50). Slice one cake diagonally and place one half on another for the roof. Decorate with Chocolate buttons for tiles, use Liquorice Allsorts for windows and chimneys. The children have added a new dimension by sticking smarties on the walls for just a smidgeon more of a sugar rush.\u201d For my 30th birthday I had an ice cream cake make up with the number of my favourite childhood footballer (Jason Dunstall). Probably speaks volumes. Phil Sawyer on the same topic: \u201cI fear ice cream cake may be alone in still enjoying the retro charm of a Mint Viennetta.\u201d You\u2019re saying my cake is a bit hipster? All the better. Lisa Hooper, who has been sending me some incredibly funny GIFs that I cannot put in here, has been sending me words as well. \u201cI cannot believe I cannot find the time of day Alistair Cook has been dismissed! Trust me I\u2019ve looked, sigh! I can almost tell you everything else, like what time he goes to the bathroom, no seriously. Devo, I would be interested in that state too.\u201d Lisa also asks what I do in the lunch break. It\u2019s this. I do this one, long post. Wild. Joe Neate calling for players for the Occasionals: \u201cFinal call for the OBOccasionals playing in Brighton next weekend (on Sunday 13th August). We\u2019ve playing in a four-team charity tournament, and nearly have full numbers, but could always take one or two more. The day itself should be awesome, with food, beer, coffee, raffles etc. You can read about our previous exploits here - http://oboccasionals.weebly.com/ - and if you\u2019re interested in turning out for us, any and all abilities are absolutely welcome. If you\u2019re interested, drop me a mail at joe.neate@gmail.com\u201d Last one. Christopher Phillips on nicknames: \u201cFrom Rugby .. Wasps coach and former British Lion \u2026. \u2018Live fast\u2019 \u2013 Dai Young.\u201d Tremendous. I played against with the Noseda Brothers in Warrnambool way back when. Peter and Andrew. It is cryptic, but work out why that wasn\u2019t so ideal in the scorebook. Excellent session. South Africa bowled more than enough wicket-taking deliveries to have many more entries to their column, but England kept their heads. Especially Cook. Hard to overstate how well Morkel bowled to him early on, but he didn\u2019t respond with anything rash. 81 balls later, he\u2019s enjoying his lunch with work to do. Westley likewise, 56 balls into his stay - more important than the 19 runs he\u2019s accumulated - showing plenty of welcome composure early in his international career. By contrast, Jennings nicked off just as he looked settled. His slow trudge from the field suggests he knows all too well what\u2019s ahead of him unless he does something profound second time up. Morkel, again, has been brilliant. Rabada less so, but don\u2019t doubt that he\u2019ll find his way sooner rather than later. Olivier hot and cold, but bowled more than his share of hooping deliveries to beat the edge. Maharaj on the money early, too. Should make for another quality session after the interval. Don\u2019t go anywhere. 29th over: England 67-1 (Cook 31, Westley 19). Maharaj gets to the bowling crease just in time for a final set before lunch. He starts with a delightful delivery to Westley, beating his edge after encouraging a long stride. No speed on that at all, ample turn. Aggressive spin bowling. Deserved a wicket. Stats don\u2019t necessarily show it, but he\u2019s had a real breakout series. Westley does make contact to the rest, pushing with soft hands to get him through to the break. That\u2019s lunch. Back in a tic with some organised thoughts. 28th over: England 67-1 (Cook 31, Westley 19). Cook again very settled in defence to Olivier. England\u2019s opener outstanding in this situation. Would love to see a stat on times of his dismissals. Shuts up shop as well as anyone before intervals, my gut feeling. Maiden. 27th over: England 67-1 (Cook 31, Westley 19). Maharaj gets a second crack before the break. Cook plays it cool. He knows the old \u2018spinner on before lunch\u2019 game. A single behind square to keep the blood pumping and ensure that he\u2019ll be in the hot seat for what might be the final over before lunch. 26th over: England 66-1 (Cook 30, Westley 19). Olivier is back. And nearly into the book again! Westley has a good old slash at the first ball he sees this over and it goes over the cordon. If you\u2019re going to go, go hard, I guess. More conservative thereafter. Needs to get to his sandwich now. That\u2019s what good no. 3s do on morning one of a Test. \u201cUp till 3am this morning to bag tickets for the WACA in December,\u201d says Paddy Ford from Cambes in France. \u201cNow snoozing by the pool in 33 degree sunshine with the TMS Overseas link and the lyrical offerings of OBO as we listen to / read of England\u2019s progress. The perfect day?\u201d And he\u2019s sent me photographic evidence. Concur. 25th over: England 61-1 (Cook 29, Westley 15). de Bryun again with his mediums. Not wrong with Cook looking far less comfortable in this match-up, highlighted by him missing a full toss, then one on leg stump - the sort of ball he\u2019s accumulated about 8,000 Test runs from. When he does get off strike Westley cops a long-hop and converts with ease, picking the gap through the covers off the back foot. His third boundary, slowly going up the gears. Probably three overs until lunch. On nicknames, we have a counterview from Tom v d Gucht: \u201cIn recent years, I\u2019d say the Aussies are winning the nickname battle with humdingers like: Mr Cricket, Punter, Michael \u201cFrothy\u201d Beer, The Finisher, Dizzy Gillespe, Pup and Binga. What have we come up with in the same period? Belly, Cooky, Broady, Jimmy and Colly... Root isn\u2019t even known as the Milky Bar Kid! We\u2019re really letting ourselves down.\u201d I just keep thinking of \u2018One Size\u2019 Fitz Hall. 24th over: England 56-1 (Cook 28, Westley 11). Oh, Tom Westley gets onto his signature stroke, a Mark Waugh clip through midwicket that races away. From middle-stump, no less. He tries it on again but straight to the fielder. Joyous to watch when he gets onto those. Into double figures. 23rd over: England 52-1 (Cook 28, Westley 7). Theunis de Bruyn gets a go with his little medium pacers. They\u2019re a bit better than that, but it\u2019s how they are being explained on the telly, noting that Cook has a bit of an issue at county level against those who nibble rather than blast. And maybe they\u2019re spot on, a leading edge coming within two balls, before he gets off strike and leaves it to Westley. Who nearly falls! Miscued drive that\u2019s in the air between gully and point. Interesting over. John Starbuck with the most John Starbuck email of all time. Thank you, John Starbuck (ref: 16th over, Jennings books): \u201cPossible titles for these days: Jennings Drops A Clanger; Jennings Falls Apart; Jennings Clings On; Jennings F**ks It Up (rejected title); Jennings At The Riverside; Jennings And The ECB etc.\u201d Actually, let\u2019s be kind and not go down this wormhole. In case he\u2019s reading along, you know. 22nd over: England 50-1 (Cook 27, Westley 6). Well, it hasn\u2019t been the most fluent 90 minutes of cricket, but England are 50 having lost just the one wicket. In turn, given the way South Africa have gone about their work, the hosts are on top. Thr former captain gets a couple through the gap at cover then uses Morkel\u2019s pace tickle fine to collect those three runs. Westley\u2019s turn. And he\u2019s once again beaten outside the off-stump. Not that he\u2019s on his own here: Morkel has done it routinely this morning. Westley should have left this one, mind. 21st over: England 47-1 (Cook 24, Westley 6). Maharaj happy to give it some air to Cook, who is straight onto the front foot. Positive cricket from both. Gets one around the corner, using the spin when the left-armer gets a bit too straight. Means he\u2019ll be back against his old mate Morkel next over. \u201cSterling job so far this morning,\u201d starts James Crowder. You better believe your email is going in if that\u2019s what you think. \u201cAre you the new Heston Blumenthal by any chance? The idea of an Ice Cream Cake infused with the delicious taste of aluminium and the smell of chain oil does sound incredibly appealing of course!\u201d I still ask for an ice cream cake come birthday time. Form an orderly queue, prospective life partners. 20th over: England 46-1 (Cook 23, Westley 6). Morkel has Westley playing and missing to begin. But over the top of the ball rather than the outside edge. He doesn\u2019t make the same mistake later in over, launching into a picture-perfect on-drive. That\u2019s his spot. A first boundary after about ten overs at the crease. That\u2019ll feel good. 19th over: England 42-1 (Cook 23, Westley 2). Spin for the first time in the match via Maharaj\u2019s left-arm orthodox. Cook not too bothered. He\u2019ll be happy with that given the interrogation from the quicks. Maiden it is. Ben Parker drops us a line. Hi Ben. \u201cImagine you are a selector and tomorrow you have to announce your Ashes squad. Which openers would you name?\u201d Simpson and Lawry. Ohhh, your openers. Cook and Hameed. I don\u2019t know, really. I don\u2019t mind Lawrence Booth\u2019s argument that Hameed will probably go on three or four Ashes tours, so the earlier you start taking him the better. But he\u2019ll have to come back for the Windies Tests if that is going to be the case. And he\u2019s barely made a run - why he isn\u2019t there to begin with. Stoneman deserves a go. Glad this isn\u2019t my problem. Actually. I\u2019d take Sam Robson. Played international cricket. Alongside most of the Australian attack in junior cricket and Under 19 Tests. Still plays in Australia in the winter. Making runs for Middlesex. Yeah, take Robbo. 18th over: England 42-1 (Cook 23, Westley 2). Morne to test out Westley for the first time now. Defending and leaving. Morkel not giving an inch. Finds an inside edge, but no danger for the No. 3. Forced to then duck a bouncer. Ends with another unplayable, Westley\u2019s edge beaten from a ball that spits away after pitching on middle. Can\u2019t do much about that. On another day South Africa would be well into the middle order by now. If England can get to lunch one down it\u2019ll be a big win for the hosts. Tim Maitland on twitter about the scandal that is Duanne Olivier\u2019s shirt. \u201cOlivier has a long way to go to catch Derek Randall, known in the Notts dressing room as Shambles\u201d. One thing Brits do a lot better than us Australians: nicknames. And singing at sporting events. 17th over: England 42-1 (Cook 23, Westley 2). Cautious Westley against Olivier. Sound, as the bowler is pushing through one legitimate wicket-taking delivery an over thus far. Oh, and here it is: the penultimate ball hoooops past Westley\u2019s edge. Lucky not to nick that, very close to the bat. He retains the strike with one around the corner. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi Tom Leversley. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you do birthday shout outs do you?\u201d Young Freddie, I hear you\u2019re ten years old today and are already part of the OBO family. Many happy returns to you from all of us at Guardian HQ. I hope your dad gets you a bike and ice cream cake. Not necessarily in that order. 16th over: England 41-1 (Cook 23, Westley 1). Back from the breather, it\u2019s Morne Morkel for a second go. He was tip top earlier, albeit only for four overs. Cook is forced to play througout, with the middle of the bat more often than not. Cops one in the thigh pad that jags back, but a lot more comfortable a half-hour on from their earlier contest. Big fan of Morne bowling in a proper cricket jumper as well, of the sleeveless variety. Should be compulsory in Manchester/Leeds Tests. Some End Chat on the telly. David Gower saying if Anderson bowls from the Jimmy End it\u2019ll be the first time that has happened in Test cricket. Let\u2019s hope it does. \u201cSudden thought strikes me - who else remembers Anthony Buckeridge\u2019s the Jennings books?\u201d asks Nick Parish. \u201cI loved them. Jennings was a schoolboy who according to Wikipedia \u201cis good-natured and well-meaning, but his tendency to act on impulse results in him getting into trouble frequently\u201d. Remind you of anyone?\u201d 15th over: England 41-1 (Cook 23, Westley 1). Olivier again good enough to beat the edge to start the over. Cook doing well not to edge any of these. Much as it was on the opening morning last Thursday. Sure enough, Olivier can\u2019t maintain the pressure, giving Cook a half-volley and he doesn\u2019t miss out, past the umpire for a boundary, taking him into the 20s inside the first hour. They take a drink. 14th over: England 36-1 (Cook 18, Westley 1). Westley does well to leave the first half of this set. But Rabada brings one back and pins him on the crease, slapping into the thigh pad and ballooning into the cordon. Amla doesn\u2019t complete the catch, so they don\u2019t burn a review. I suspect they may have - they were pretty excited when the ball was in the air, but the replay showed no inside edge. Maiden. I have a layered email from Anthony White that I\u2019m just going to publish in full. \u201cI was finding your remarks about young Keaton a little snidey and rather intolerant. However, perhaps I owe you an apology, you can show kindness when you wish, and I have realised that by not erring on the complimentary, for instance that K.J. Is looking comfortable, you are attempting to unjinx him. And cover your own arse. Delightedly, Anthony\u201d For the record, I\u2019m a Durham sympathiser and want him to make it. But I fear for what\u2019ll happen in Brisbane when the Fab Four are let loose. 13th over: England 36-1 (Cook 18, Westley 1). Westley leaving initially. Then gets another screamer. South Africa\u2019s trio of seamers have bowled plenty of those in this first hour. England\u2019s number three off the mark clipping to midwicket. Would have been four if not for a good stop. Yes, Tom. As he and his Essex teammate Dan Lawrence say: play across, be the boss. \u201cOlivier really, really reminds me of Mike Watkinson. 20% the hair, 80% the bowling action,\u201d suggests Matt Biss. \u201cSee.\u201d Mostly enjoying the batting stance. Don\u2019t make them - or teach them, more to the point - like that anymore. Jennings will be gutted with that, pushing tentatively at a Olivier delivery that didn\u2019t require playing at. Conventional edge, easily taken. Nothing wrong with the delivery, and on reflection it did a bit after pitching, but no world-beater either. Despite doing plenty of hard work, Jennings off to spend the rest of his day in purgatory. 12th over: England 35-0 (Cook 18, Jennings 17). Rabada tags Cook on the glove with a nasty bouncer, but despite doing everything right the bowler concedes four with the ball ending up over de Kock\u2019s head, down to the rope. Jennings digs out a yorker to end the over and retains the strike. He\u2019ll regret that though, because... 11th over: England 29-0 (Cook 13, Jennings 16). Olivier bowling with his shirt untucked from the get go. This isn\u2019t right. Any counterview? Come on. Tuck it in. All over the place with the ball two, ranging from being too quick for Jennings to a half-volley next up, driven away neatly. Working into this, the battling opener. Defends and leaves competently. Couple more down the ground to end the over when he\u2019s too full again. Confidence growing. David Lloyd runs through every band who have ever played at Old Trafford. It\u2019s an impressive list. Predictably Warne jumps in: COLDPLAY! 10th over: England 23-0 (Cook 13, Jennings 10). It is Rabada again and its is his turn to sort Cook out with a beauty. In a competitive field that\u2019s the ball of the morning, pitching leg before going past the edge and missing off. Magnificent. The superstar gets one to move back the other way later in the over, Cook doing well not only to keep it out but then to profit by a couple behind square leg. \u201cFinally a good start from our openers!\u201d says Ian Copestake. Presumably with a tongue in the cheek? \u201cHope this will keep the wolves from Jennings\u2019 door as he deserves our support not the sneering and sniping that seems to come his way.\u201d Yes, a tongue in the cheek. 9th over: England 21-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 10). Morkel given a rest. Not sure about that? Surely a matter of time for him to sort out Jennings. Unless he\u2019s being turned around to follow Rabada. In any case, it\u2019s Olivier here. Before his first ball Bumble suggests that he should be on a hat-trick here, despite the previous two wickets coming at Trent Bridge. Shane Warne agrees. Ummm? Anyway, it is a moot point, spraying the first one down the legside. Next up he\u2019s right on it, beating Jennings with one that really hoops away. Jennings profits from a short one, punching it past point for four. Nice pressure release. But the bowler is back on it by the end of the set, again beating him outside the off-stump. More batsman error there - definitely one to leave alone this early rather than driving. 8th over: England 17-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 6). Cook gets a go at Rabada. Comfortable. Then carving, not missing out when the quick gives him a short one outside the off-stump. Very much in the Chef\u2019s ~area~. Looking good. 7th over: England 13-0 (Cook 7, Jennings 6). Cook\u2019s first boundary, Morkel overpitching and punching it down the ground with a mininum of fuss. Our first single of the day coming to the next ball as well, in front of square with a tuck. So, Morkel gets a chance at Jennings. This should be interesting. He\u2019s okay to begin, but then does one of those play-leaves (pleaves) that nearly is his undoing. Smashed on the pad to end the over. Good luck, Keaton. Let us know how you get on. Copped not one but three emails asking for the TMS YouTube link. Must admit, I didn\u2019t realise this was a thing we did on the OBO, but as an occasional commentator on there myself, very happy to oblige. While talking TMS, make sure you catch the BBC special. Beautifully produced by Tim Peach with archives dug into deeply. 6th over: England 8-0 (Cook 2, Jennings 6). Another over with no strike rotation. Jennings doing well here actually, defending on the stumps, getting away from the shorter stuff without too much concern. In other words, looking like an opener. Rabada the lesser of the two quicks so far this morning. Maiden all the same. My man Phil Withall is livin\u2019 la vida loca: \u201cIn preparation for the football season starting in the morning (Australian time) I will be watching the cricket until I fall asleep on the sofa, hurt my neck and get a lecture from my wife about the stupidity of my sporting addictions. It\u2019s going to be a wonderful nine months.\u201d 5th over: England 8-0 (Cook 2, Jennings 6). Cook away with a confident push into the covers for a couple. But it is advantage bowler soon enough, Cook smashed on the thigh pad and then getting a thick inside edge onto the back of his pad to end the over. He\u2019s been here so many times, the England champion. He knows survival is everything. So the fact that this is ugly won\u2019t bother him in the slightest. Cook seeing every ball so far from Morkel, at the Jimmy end it\u2019s exclusively Jennings v Rabada. 4th over: England 6-0 (Cook 0, Jennings 6). So there is a short-leg now. Okay, I won\u2019t go on about it. Nice clip to get him away through midwicket this over, Jennings adding to his glanced boundary from the second over. But next up, he\u2019s beaten. It\u2019s not as threatening as Morkel\u2019s earlier barrage to Cook, but enough to leave Jennings looking tentative. Better footwork to defend, and then when hit on the pad he\u2019s well forward so the shout is denied. Testing times for the opener on what must be his last chance. Proper Test cricket. 3rd over: England 4-0 (Cook 0, Jennings 4). Morkel goes straighter to Cook second time around, twice up for ambitious leg-before appeals. Neither realistically considered for referral. But a good signs for the quick. Still no short leg, FYI. 2nd over: England 4-0 (Cook 0, Jennings 4). It\u2019s Kagiso Rabada from the James Anderson End. And he\u2019s created a chance too - a fat inside edge from Jennings onto his thigh-pad. The athletic quick races towards short leg (WHY IS THERE NO SHORT LEG?) and puts in a full-stretch dive, falling about six inches short. More frustratingly for the bowler, ther is a fielder with the shin pads on 20m from the bat ready to come in. Neglected to mention that in the build up - nice moment with the end naming yesterday. Botham speculates that Anderson should be worried, though: \u201cThey normally do that when a player has finished, maybe they know something he doesn\u2019t!\u201d Zing. 1st over: England 0-0 (Cook 0, Jennings 0). Oooh! Morkel does Cook with an absolute beauty second up. Around the wicket, forcing the left-hander to play, steepling off the seam. He bowled magnificently at times at The Oval. Increased responsibility today in Philander\u2019s absence. Oh, and he does it again two balls later. Then a third time to end the over. Goodness me - that\u2019s one of the best opening overs you\u2019ll see. Simple as that. Miscellanea. Thick and fast with your correspondence so far. Great. Don\u2019t be shy. Jon Short on twitter asks of Olivier will be on a hat-trick having taken wickets with his last two balls at Trent Bridge? Best I get on this one early: the answer is no. You can only take a hat-trick inside a single match. So, had Moeen not got another chance the other day he wouldn\u2019t be on one here, either. ... Take Shane Warne\u2019s hat-trick. The ball was his final delivery in the 1994 Boxing Day Test but Craig McDermott selfishly picked up Tuffers the next over. So he never got a chance for four-in-four. \u201cI\u2019m oddly excited about this last Test. I saw the Sat and Sun of the Trent Bridge test which was not great from an England fan point of view, but overall I think we deserve to be 2-1 up,\u201d writes Jim Procter-Blain. \u201cJust hope the murky manc weather doesn\u2019t become a factor.\u201d ... It is the first time that South Africa have played at Old Trafford since England held on for a gallant draw in 1998. Just thought that was worth mentioning. Smyth\u2019s piece, again, on the Headingley Test of that summer. He\u2019s taking over from me later, I should add. ... Big fan of David Gower and David Lloyd spending some time chatting about the Kia Super League before the toss. \u201cAmazing timing,\u201d says Bumble. That it is. Eight games on telly. Did you enjoy the World Cup? Of course you did. Back in the KSL. It\u2019s a big deal. Go on. ... I can hear Jerusalem, so we must be pretty close. Here is my account of how that became England\u2019s cricket anthem. Largely due to professional wrestling, would you believe. ... That\u2019ll do us. Morne Morkel has the ball in his hand. Let\u2019s play. Some reaction from the press box. Tails is the call, and it is heads. \u201cYes, we\u2019re going to bat first,\u201d says Joe Root. Says it looks a good wicket, cites success batting first at Old Trafford. No change to the XI who romped it in at The Oval. There are changes for South Africa, Vernon Philander and Chris Morris both missing through injury. We knew the former was a chance, not the latter. de Bruyn is back into the XI, as is Olivier. Both have played during the series. Significant. Faf du Plessis says he would have batted as well, but is encouraged by a bit of overcast conditions. Can England knock over South Africa in a home series for the first time since 1998? Will the Proteas be able to take something from this epic tour by squaring the ledger at Manchester? That\u2019s the bird\u2019s-eye take on this fourth and final rubber. England put on a clinic last week at The Oval. But current form is seldom a reliable indicator on future performance for this volatile side. At least they keep it interesting. As for South Africa, it is bound to click again at some stage before they fly home. The margins in London did not at all reflect how well they bowled in either rubber. That Philander is not yet a 100% confirmed starter with a sore back doesn\u2019t help, mind. As ever, the subplots are just as interesting. Will Keaton Jennings save his career? How will Tom Westley go when it\u2019s grim and yuk and a week of northern rain? Will Hashim Amla\u2019s final performance on these shores reflect what a special player he has been in these contests? Righto. Adam Collins with you here to take a look at all that over the first few hours this morning. Let\u2019s chat in the usual way: adam.collins.freelance@theguardian.com - or the nonsense way, if that\u2019s your bag. As long as we\u2019re together. Back with that in a tic.

"2||With political will, we could easily solve our transport problemsGeorge Monbiot makes some useful points in his article bemoaning the influence of the lobbying power of the motor industry (We must break the car\u2019s chokehold on Britain, 2 August). He proposes a modal transport shift to more coach travel and investment in nuclear power plants to power our electric cars. He ignores completely, as usual, the solar option with smaller electric cars and electric bikes and charged by photovoltaics on homes, at work and in public places. In 1993, I bought Hannibal, the 750kg fibreglass Kewet El Jet electric car that we used for a decade to take the children to school, go shopping and to train and bus stations. This first British solar car was largely powered by the 4kWp PV roof on my Oxford ecohouse. Monbiot also ignores the huge trend towards using electric bikes that can be easily solar charged at home or work. We love our cars and bikes, but the trick is to make them much smaller, lighter and solar powered, used locally and to connect with public transport systems for longer distances, so decrying any need for building inevitably toxic new nuclear power stations at all. Car size does matter now if we, as a society, are serious about surviving safely into the 22nd century, so let\u2019s have less of Jeremy Clarkson on TV and more solar-powered Good Lives. It\u2019s the mindset that has to change first, then the hardware. Emeritus Professor Sue Roaf Oxford \u2022 George Monbiot and several of your readers (Letters, 28 July and 31 July) have drawn attention to the folly of the government\u2019s 2040 initiative. It does not need 2020 hindsight to see that the demands on electricity generation will rocket in order to support a nation using only electric cars. Where will this electricity come from and at whose expense? What is still perplexing is Mr Monbiot\u2019s continued support for nuclear power. Has he overlooked the massive clean-up and decommissioning bills which are accumulating? Is he dismissing nuclear accidents as inconvenient truths? And relying on the \u201cburial\u201d method for centuries to come? Nuclear (at least the fission sort) is still only an interim solution at best. There is only one way that an energy budget can be balanced in the long term without polluting: through renewables. Rather than consider whether to support electric cars or nuclear, we should install as much renewable generation as possible and perhaps, for once, live within its limits. A real joined-up policy would invest in expanding a nationalised rail network and encourage more people to travel by train than car. Two-way rail lines take up far less countryside than six-lane highways. Transporting goods too can be streamlined, with local depots handling the shorter distribution distances required while reducing the number of lorries on our roads \u2013 which might be better served by a nationalised postal service than fragmented companies competing unnecessarily: prices never seem to fall as a result of so-called competition. But on one point I can agree with Mr Monbiot: we are unlikely to see an ambitious plan for national infrastructure planning from governments focussing only on five-year election cycles. Dr John Ellis Tavistock, Devon \u2022 I read with interest a recent letter from Colin Read (31 July), who insisted that electric cars were shifting pollution from the car tailpipe to power stations. First, as an investor in energy, I would kindly point out that the efficiency of converting energy from one big engine, versus 1,000,000 small engines, is significantly different due to economies of scale. Second, the shift assumes that electric grids will continue to cater to peak demand. Currently, we are unable to store energy once it is generated from power stations \u2013 fossil fuel or renewable alike. But electric grids will in the next three to five years start to cater towards average demand, because of the innovation in energy storage. The exciting prospect is a 24/7 renewable electric grid, which energy storage makes possible. You get the efficiency of a grid system and the cleanness of renewables in one, and cheaply. A specific type of storage \u2013 liquid metal batteries \u2013 offers the greatest chance of commercial success, not least due to the short lifespan and dangers of lithium batteries. The greatest impediments to this are no longer scientific or commercial but political. UK government employees, not your typical risk takers by virtue of their employer, risk credibility when presenting innovation \u2013 concerning, when 42% of UK GDP is decided by government spending. Given the choice between making a comparatively risk-free decision over Hinkley Point C, and the decision to deploy new technology, which would you choose? Of course, the answer is to build both and then gradually shift to renewable energy, but the speed of this graduation, decided by how much risk the mandarins are willing to take, is what will determine whether we shift pollution from tailpipes to power stations. Josh Burge London \u2022 With almost 30% of lorries on our roads totally empty and average HGV loading only around 50%, sorting out freight transport can be part of the road transport solution. In order to get better efficiency from HGVs, instead of the current old-fashioned time-based system which neither measures the actual miles driven nor the full economic, safety and environmental impact of the HGV traffic, the government should introduce a distance-based lorry charging system. This measure could incentivise better utilisation of lorries, thus reducing lorry miles, crashes and pollution. Furthermore, it would also make it easier for rail freight, the safer, sustainable alternative, which reduces road congestion, to compete; one large freight train can remove up to 136 HGVs. Philippa Edmunds Freight on rail manager, Campaign for Better Transport \u2022 During weekdays unused cars line suburban streets. At weekends they choke town centres. Cars have become a status symbol rather than a sometime convenience. Many citizens are duped into undertaking the huge often unnecessary expense involved in car ownership even when adequate public transport is readily available. Often car ownership with the concomitant abuse of energy and resources would properly be a cause of shame rather than pride. As George Monbiot says, it is time to put the focus on cycling. This means designing our town centres to discourage cars and support bikes. It means park-and-ride schemes, frequent and flexible bus services, bike design for the elderly as well as the young, and pedestrianisation of town centres. Cars are expensive, polluting and dangerous, and dictate the design of towns to accommodate machines instead of people. Time to start designing our town centres for the benefit of citizens, not machines. Jim McCluskey Twickenham, Middlesex \u2022 The government is pressing ahead with its HS2 project at a cost of \u00a360bn to be completed in the early 2030s. At the same time it has just announced a policy of phasing out diesel and petrol vehicles by 2040. Are there any projections available of the impact of this ban on traffic volumes? It seems likely that we will end up with a reduction in the number of vehicles on our roads, particularly motorways. As there are currently two motorways from London to Birmingham, why isn\u2019t one of these converted into the HS2 route? This would slash the project\u2019s costs and avoid some of the major environmental impacts of the current plan. Phil Gilbert Hallaton, Leicestershire \u2022 While overhead electrification is expensive in both cost and time, why is consideration not given to the \u201cthird rail\u201d electrification which powers most of the railways in the south-east plus the very reliable Mersey Rail trains around Liverpool. Installing a third rail can\u2019t be as expensive as building gantries and pylons. The rail industry needs to look at other alternatives, including having trains with the ability to obtain power from more than one source. Michael Nicolson Southport, Merseyside \u2022 \u201cGarden cities encouraged long journeys to work\u201d declares Simon Jenkins (We\u2019re addicted to travel. And we need to be cured, 3 August). That is the direct opposite of the truth. The central principle of the garden cities, and of their successors, the postwar new towns, was that there would be sufficient suitable employment for residents locally, so that they would not need to take long journeys to work. This was seen as an essential factor in allowing communal life to develop healthily. That eminently sensible principle has been largely eroded over the years by the dysfunctional way our national economy has proceeded, with the result that a far higher proportion of the people of such towns have been forced to spend much of their lives travelling long distances to work. But that should never be blamed on those who envisaged and developed these towns.

"8||Ken Livingstone: putting the record straight on VenezuelaI\u2019m very disappointed at the reporting of my comments regarding the situation in Venezuela (Report, 4 August). I have not said that Hugo Ch\u00e1vez should have killed anyone and nor would I ever advocate it. I even dispelled this accusation in the very interview that is being extensively quoted. The point I was making is that, contrary to some misrepresentations, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez didn\u2019t repress the former ruling elite in Venezuela and many of this former elite have stayed in the country, seeking to overthrow elected presidents through unconstitutional and violent means (including the coup in 2002) ever since. Ken Livingstone London \u2022 Notwithstanding what is clearly a very difficult moment in Venezuela, it is noticeable that any country in the orbit of the US that tries to move towards a more equal society seems to end up in a destabilised mess. I wonder if there is something a little more than coincidence at work here. Historically speaking, that has certainly been the case from Cuba in the 1950s to Chile in the 1970s and beyond.

"15||Time to get a grip on ejaculation statisticsAndrew Barnard (Letters, 2 August) wrote in response to Suzanne Moore\u2019s article (Making babies is beginning to look as difficult for men as it always has for women, 27 July) that her statistics were exaggerated and need to be checked because they would mean \u201can average of just over four ejaculations per week\u201d. Mr Barnard needs to check what his male friends are up to, because a 2007 survey by Cupid Bay suggested men ejaculate on average eight times a week. It may also be worth his while to read the current NHS guidance on avoiding prostate cancer which encourages ejaculating at least 21 times a month. His suggestion that the author might have got her gallons mixed up with litres is laughable and would leave a large number of men hitting the lifetime average in their teenage years. Mark Oates London \u2022 I wonder whether Andrew Barnard has considered that Suzanne Moore\u2019s statistics are correct and that he is just not trying hard enough? Derek Worthing Bristol \u2022 Andrew Barnard is quite right, though I would have thought that ejaculation rates vary according to age \u2013 ie the frequency is greater from teenage years to about late 40s, but declines thereafter. I\u2019m also curious to know how these figures were obtained. Were men (or their partners) asked to keep records of the number of ejaculations per day over an extended period? I understand also that boars can shoot out 800 milligrams at one go. What fun! Meirion Bowen London \u2022 Suzanne Moore estimated total male ejaculate at 14 gallons, Andrew Barnard thought it more likely to be 14 litres, but I reckon Max got it just about right in Phoenix Nights when he confided to Paddy that he\u2019d only been allotted \u201ca bucket and an \u2019alf\u201d. According to my garden bucket that amounts to 20 litres. Paul Tattam Chinley, Derbyshire \u2022 I must dispute Andrew Barnard\u2019s \u201coft-quoted average\u201d volume of ejaculate as 5ml. As any pop fan with an interest in band name derivations knows, a \u201cLovin\u2019 Spoonful\u201d is \u201c10cc\u201d. This immediately reduces the average lifetime\u2019s ejaculations to a more realistic 6,370.

"5||Fentanyl concern may demonise a vital drugPlease be mindful of your potential to frighten people unnecessarily (Report, 1 August). Fentanyl is indeed between 100 and 150 times as potent as morphine but when used in the microgram doses available in commercial products it is as safe as any other strong opioid for the management of severe pain whether post-operative, chronic or towards the end of life. Clearly lacing street drugs with this molecule is highly dangerous but a broad-brush approach is unhelpful. Healthcare professionals work hard to develop a trusting relationship with the people they are caring for. Many are fearful of strong opioid medicines but we know how to use them to good effect and it would be tragic if front-page articles worried some enough to stop taking it and revert to being in pain. Margaret Gibbs (Palliative care pharmacist) Bromley, Kent \u2022 Recent Guardian reports rightly highlight current concerns regarding a dangerous spike in the illegal use by addicts of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. While this publicity is justified, I am concerned that there is a danger of demonising a drug whose medical use in the management of severe pain is vital. During the last few years of her life, my wife Christine, who had severe multiple sclerosis, was prescribed fentanyl skin patches. These proved the only effective treatment to counter the pain created by an increasingly twisted and immobile body. Without this vital drug, I shudder to think how much more difficult her final years might have been.

"8||Shares boycott to defend rights of Saudi womenThe City should have nothing to do with the proposed listing of shares in Aramco by the government of Saudi Arabia, let alone stand by while the Financial Conduct Authority rigs the system to facilitate it. The Guardian, and now the Institute of Directors (Report, 2 August), have forcefully argued the investment case against such bending of the rules. But in this era of corporate social responsibility there are even more powerful reasons to reject this defiance of hard-learned regulatory lessons. The government of Saudi Arabia has an abysmal record on the everyday legal rights for women we take for granted elsewhere. Women are, for example, not allowed to drive, they need the consent of a male guardian to get a passport, or even get out of prison, and can be denied a job, or hospital treatment, without it. This shocking denial of human rights is comparable to that suffered by black people in South Africa under apartheid. It should disqualify Aramco as an investment for any company (or person) with any pretence to a social conscience. Money talks loudly when Saudi Arabia speaks, but there is scope for all of us to make our voices heard. We invite all those who support basic legal rights for women, wherever they live, to ask their pension fund providers and banks to steer clear of Aramco shares if and when they are listed, unless Saudi Arabia has by then allowed women to drive and abolished the guardianship system.

"16||Arts funding: \u00a3700m needed to bridge north-south divide, study findsThe arts in northern England should be allocated almost \u00a3700m to receive an equal level of funding as London, according to a thinktank. The analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research North revealed the scale of the funding gap between northern cities and the capital. It found that for the north to get the same Arts Council England funding per head as the capital it would need \u00a3691m more in the 2018-22 funding round. The report comes after the government reannounced plans to invest \u00a315m to ensure next year\u2019s Great Exhibition of the North, in Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, has lasting benefits. The thinktank said the government should stop reannouncing money it has already committed and instead pledge \u201cfresh billions\u201d to the north. MPs expressed concern over the funding disparity. Naz Shah, the Labour MP for Bradford West, said she was \u201cappalled and dismayed by the figures\u201d. She said: \u201cThis tells you something that we have already known, that there is a north-south divide and it really hinders arts culture and development of communities.\u201d Cat Smith, the MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said: \u201cFunding for the arts and museums in the north is difficult to come by these days because of Tory cuts. The task of keeping award-winning northern theatres like the Dukes in Lancaster open and inspiring future generations is one which gets harder by each financial year.\u201d She added: \u201cThe appetite to support the arts is there \u2013 with the Dukes\u2019 theatre in the park this year extended by a week \u2013 but museums like Fleetwood Museum and the Judges\u2019 Lodgings in Lancashire are now run by volunteers with no support from the county council. If the government really is committed to a northern powerhouse, it should fund some of our fantastic arts on a level with those in the capital.\u201d Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council, described the \u00a315m arts funding announcement as \u201cnothing more than a rehash\u201d of previous commitments. She said: \u201cIt is a desperate attempt to deflect attention away from the growing furore surrounding the north-south funding imbalance.\u201d Luke Rakes, a senior research fellow at IPPR North, said the government had made it clear rumours it had gone cold on the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d project were not true. \u201cBut it needs to back this up with real action,\u201d he said. \u201cTalking up the northern powerhouse is very different to actually giving the fresh billions promised by George Osborne, such as for a high-speed link from Manchester to Leeds and rebuilding Manchester Piccadilly.\u201d The Museums Association\u2019s survey of cuts in 2015 found stark regional differences, with museums in northern England reporting larger year-on-year decreases than other parts of England. More than 20 museums in the north and the Midlands have closed since 2010. In 2015 the Theatres Trust warned that the number of northern venues included in its theatres at risk register showed a lack of investment in buildings in the region. Louise Haigh, the MP for Sheffield Heeley, said: \u201cWe know this has been a longstanding issue and arts have been historically underfunded in the north ... it\u2019s created a vicious circle in that we lack the infrastructure to host exhibitions.\u201d She added: \u201cThe arts council needs to correct this in order for culture and the arts to flourish.\u201d An Arts Council spokesperson said: \u201cAn extra \u00a342.5m per year \u2013 \u00a3170m over the four-year period \u2013 will be spent outside London between 2018 and 2022. This is a significant boost. We\u2019re dealing with historic imbalance here.\u201d They added: \u201cA significant portion of grant in aid funding is used to invest in major national institutions like the National Theatre and Southbank Centre in London. We think it\u2019s vital to support the work they do, which represents the very best of our art and culture on a global stage. Because of this commitment it is not realistic to imagine a faster rate of progress in increasing grant-in-aid investment outside London, unless of course we were given a larger allocation from government.\u201d"

"17||Cowes Week sailing extravaganza spawns a renting boom in Isle of WightWhen a house that normally rents for \u00a3500 a week can find a tenant willing to pay \u00a316,000 for a nine-day let, it is a sure sign that there is big money in town. The town is Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, and the money arrives with the annual Cowes Week sailing extravaganza. Sailors, socialites and the super-wealthy descended on the island this week for the 191-year-old sailing event which culminates on Saturday with a black tie champagne and cocktails awards party. Many have paid huge sums to secure the best accommodation close to the action on the Solent and the socialising in the marina. One sailing team has spent \u00a316,000 renting a seven-bedroom house for the event. The Anchorage, an ivy clad former B&amp;B, has been let to the Adriatic Europa sailing team led by former Olympian Du\u0161an Puh. The property, which is on the market for \u00a3499,500, is let for less than \u00a3500-a-week during the off season. A three-bedroom house just a five minute walk away from the Anchorage is available to rent for \u00a3156-a-week \u2013 or \u00a38,100 for a whole year. Local estate agents say other teams and rich individuals have spent even more to secure the relatively few high quality large houses on the island, which is also the location of some of the most deprived streets in the country. Imogen Witherwick, an estate agent at Lancasters on Cowes High Street, said sailors often \u201coffer just so much money, people can\u2019t say no to letting out their homes\u201d. Witherwick, who helped arrange the rental of the Anchorage, said there were probably nine or 10 homes nearby that had been let out for similar figures. \u201cPeople will be quite honest, they want the best houses on the island,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople with boats have a lot of money. It\u2019s a whole other world. \u201d Once rented, she says, the properties are installed with cleaning and waiting staff alongside celebrity chefs to prepare culinary delights for private parties. Some Cowes Week regulars, including big business executives, are said to have given up on renting and have instead bought houses that they use for just one or two weeks a year for the sailing festival. Witherwick\u2019s boss, Ben Hollis, said some yacht racing fans make impulse purchases of properties during Cowes Week: \u201cYou get people strolling the high street who like the idea of having a place here rather than renting and sometimes they buy just to use it one week in the year,\u201d he said. \u201cOne guy wanted to own the biggest waterfront apartment in Cowes. He offered the owner double what he had paid for it \u2013 about \u00a32.25m \u2013 but he refused to sell, so he bought two apartments underneath and knocked them together.\u201d Hollis said the new owner, who he declined to name, has yet to stay in the apartment three years after buying it. \u201cHe just likes to sail past it and say \u2018I have the biggest flat in Cowes\u2019.\u201d In previous years, Hollis said he had been given the task of finding accommodation for a sailing team of 18 crew and six or seven support staff. \u201cTheir budget for 10 days was just over \u00a3200,000,\u201d he said. As well as the private parties and black tie cocktail evenings at the famous Royal Yacht Squadron sailing club, upmarket London restaurants have opened pop-up venues on the waterfront. One has taken over the former home of sailing legend Uffa Fox \u2013 once called the Commodore\u2019s House and now called the Boathouse Cowes \u2013 to serve only grilled prime Aberdeen ribeye steak. Angy Collins, who is running the pop-up, said she decided to start it because there are few high-end restaurants on the island. \u201cI thought it was a real shame that they don\u2019t really have good restaurant for Cowes Week, so we decided to open this. Because I\u2019m an islander, hopefully it will be OK with the people here.\u201d The high living of Cowes week contrasts sharply with everyday life on the island when the regatta, which is sponsored by peer-to-peer lender Lendy, packs up and leaves town. The Isle of Wight has one of the highest bankruptcy rates in the country with 38 out of every 10,000 adults declared insolvent last year. The island contains 13 lower super output areas (LSOA) \u2013 small geographic areas, like council wards \u2013 that are classified among the most deprived in the country. The scale of deprivation has deteriorated over the past five years in 11 of the 13 LSOA areas. While the island is just three miles across the Solent from some of the most affluent areas in the country, more than 7,400 children are living in poverty. According to the End Child Poverty campaign, the island ranks as the fourth worst parliamentary constituency for child poverty in the country. The island hit the headlines last year when the former chairman of Ofsted, David Hoare, was forced to stand down after describing the island as a \u201cghetto\u201d of mass crime, high unemployment, drug addiction and inbreeding. \u201cMost people go there for sailing for two weeks a year,\u201d he told a teaching conference last year. \u201cThere\u2019s a sailing club that is one of the best in the world, where there\u2019s champagne. But just within inches, there are people who live in a ghetto and we\u2019ve allowed it to happen.\u201d One of the poorest areas on the island is in East Cowes, just a short trip on the floating bridge from the sailing set in Cowes. Philip Lloyd, the mayor of East Cowes, said that while its posher cousin, on the western side of the Medina river, benefited from a great financial fillip from Cowes Week, very little money was spent in the east. \u201cWe\u2019re the Cinderella side,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything happens at West Cowes and nothing ever happens over here. We have two council wards that are in a lot of trouble, one is underprivileged and was until recently classed as an action area. \u201cWe see the sailors \u2013 we call them the grotty yachties \u2013 come over on the car ferry but they just go westward into Cowes. We\u2019re just hoping that a new marina will get the go ahead and bring people into East Cowes.\u201d"
"13||Paul Chowdhry: \u2018People write this abuse to me, and I\u2019ve just got to take it?\u2019We are surveying, from the terrace, Paul Chowdhry\u2019s garden, which is quite large (for London) and very neat. He has, he confesses, a man who comes to help him keep on top of it. That\u2019s posh, I say. Having considered himself working-class all his life, Chowdhry is now considering whether he\u2019s middle-class. He does have hummus in the kitchen, I point out. \u201cAnd it\u2019s organic,\u201d he says, deadpan. You may know Chowdhry from television, but possibly not. He doesn\u2019t have a huge TV profile \u2013 he\u2019s never done Mock the Week; he\u2019s only done two editions of Live at the Apollo. Bookers rarely ask him on their panel shows (just one episode of 8 out of 10 Cats). He hosted the final series of Channel 4\u2019s Stand Up for the Week, but his audience \u2013 one of the most diverse audiences of any current standup \u2013 has been largely built through word of mouth and social media, particularly the videos he makes and posts. He has done two sold-out tours, What\u2019s Happening White People? in 2012, and 2015\u2019s PC\u2019s World, both of which were filmed for DVD. His new tour, which takes in Edinburgh, is about to start and he has had to add dates to cope with the demand. It includes two dates at Wembley Arena. There have been attempts to pigeonhole Chowdhry throughout his career but they have never really succeeded. He is nearly 43 but could pass for a twentysomething. Early on, he was considered by TV commissioning editors as an \u201cAsian comic\u201d, and put on comedy shows with other comics of Asian heritage. It\u2019s true that he does lots of niche jokes about Gujuratis, and uses a liberal sprinkling of Punjabi swearwords, but he rejects being described as an Asian comic. His stage presence can be abrasive, controlling, self-assured; in person he seems gentle and unassuming. He says he is left-leaning, and his act punctures bigotry, but some of his jokes can also have shades of misogyny and homophobia. Later in our conversation, the subject of London Underground\u2019s decision to stop using \u201cladies and gentlemen\u201d in favour of non-binary language comes up and he sounds aghast (I think \u2013 it can be hard to tell with his straight-faced delivery). \u201cWhere do you stop?\u201d he says, then softens. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll do that one day, not be labelled as something.\u201d The show, Live Innit, covers, just for starters: class, prejudice, the way Brexit is changing the country, loss, dating in the age of Tinder, and being mistaken for a terrorist. One of its big themes, he says, is mental health and the difference between sadness and depression. Has he had depression? \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t been on antidepressants, but I\u2019ve thought I\u2019ve been depressed. Mental health is such a complex issue, and it\u2019s hard to find out when you\u2019re sad and when you\u2019re depressed. Sadness is a natural human emotion. People say \u2018depressed\u2019 and you\u2019re taking away from the people who are really depressed. I\u2019ve known friends who have gone to the doctors\u2019 and said: \u2018I\u2019m really sad about a breakup,\u2019 and they\u2019ve been given antidepressants.\u201d He started going to mental health groups and talks on depression. \u201cPeople who help you break through, mental blockages [you may have] \u2013 find out where they come from. Having a balance in your mind. Before, I\u2019d be either really happy or really down in the dumps, and now it\u2019s [about] trying to surf across the middle and keeping it balanced. It wasn\u2019t really therapy because it was a massive group of people, seminars and talks and stuff. I\u2019ve never really sat down with a therapist.\u201d Chowdhry\u2019s mother died when he was five. He talks about this in his new show, the first time he has felt able to do so publicly. \u201cYou don\u2019t quite understand it when you\u2019re five,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only things you see are superheroes who have lost a parent and become a superhero. But that doesn\u2019t help a child. When you\u2019re five, you don\u2019t get it \u2013 you think they\u2019ll come back.\u201d He doesn\u2019t want to give away the punchline \u2013 there is one, of course \u2013 and it won\u2019t be a sombre show. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have people come to the shows and be crying.\u201d He laughs. \u201cImagine doing that for 100 shows! I\u2019d have a breakdown by the end of it. The reason I talk about it is, if people have gone through these things \u2026 I\u2019m not sure if it will help them, but it\u2019s a way to try and balance it in their own mind.\u201d It is his most personal set since 2007\u2019s Lost in Confusion. In that, he spoke a lot about his experience of growing up in the 70s and 80s, and the racism he and his family endured. He was beaten up by skinheads as a teenager. When he was 13, his father was coming home from a night out with his brothers when they were attacked by a gang; Chowdhry\u2019s dad was stabbed in the face and had to have 50 stitches. Chowdhry remembers him coming home from hospital in the morning. \u201cHe just got on with his day,\u201d he remembers. The police didn\u2019t do anything. Now he gets it online all the time. It started around 2014 when his profile began to increase. \u201cPeople would write this abuse to me, and I\u2019ve just got to take it?\u201d he says. \u201cI thought, you know what, I should turn this on its head. I\u2019d basically treat them like a heckler.\u201d He likes to film their Facebook profiles with a running commentary, and upload the videos on to Facebook, where they get millions of views. In 2003, he was attacked backstage by someone who had been heckling him during a gig. He has had death threats. He took one to the police, who failed to do much about it; a few months later, they told him they were letting it drop. \u201cI said, \u2018What do I do if he turns up?\u2019 \u2018Well, call us if he turns up.\u2019\u201d He gives a grim laugh. \u201c\u2018It might be a bit late then.\u2019\u201d In the past couple of weeks, commentators and comedians have been talking about the comic Daniel Kitson\u2019s show, in which he says the word \u201cPaki\u201d several times. The debate hinges on whether it is acceptable for a white comedian (in front of a largely white, although almost certainly liberal, audience) to use such a toxic word so casually, even to prove a point about racism, when he \u2013 and they \u2013 can have no real grasp of its effect. Chowdhry hasn\u2019t seen Kitson\u2019s show. \u201cI\u2019d have to see it to know how he said the joke,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not one to say we can ban words, or say: \u2018I can say this word because I\u2019m Asian.\u2019 Does he have the right to use it? If it\u2019s in context and it\u2019s a powerful routine \u2026 Louis CK uses the N-word a lot in his act.\u201d But, he adds: \u201cThe word does make you wince, it does make your stomach churn. It was a normal word [in the past] and we had to laugh along with it. I kind of don\u2019t want to hear it any more.\u201d Other comics have said it to him backstage at gigs \u201cin an ironic way, as they see it. But I don\u2019t read it that way.\u201d At least, he says, it has made people talk about it. \u201cWould you say that in front of a black comic? It\u2019s almost as if Asian people are [supposed to be] submissive: \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s funny, don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019\u201d Chowdhry grew up in Edgware (his father had come to the UK from India in 1964, and worked as a bus conductor before buying a newsagent\u2019s and sandwich shop). He realised at school that he was funny and interested in comedy, but was too scared as a teenager, having grown up largely on a comedy diet of Bernard Manning, to go to a comedy club. \u201cI watched [Manning] on videos and he\u2019d pick out the \u2018ethnic\u2019 [in the audience] and rip them apart. That looked like my worst nightmare.\u201d Later, he got hold of cassettes of American comics such as Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy, and started seeking out others. He dropped out of a computer science degree, took a course in film and TV, and started working as an extra \u2013 getting jobs on Holby City and in the film Rogue Trader \u2013 while building up his comedy skills at open-mic nights. Within a couple of years, he was appearing at the Comedy Store and Jongleurs. He loved, he says, \u201cthe instant hit of an audience, that instant reaction you get. I love doing the online videos and that\u2019s probably as close as you can get [when not playing live] to being on stage and in front of a room full of strangers.\u201d Some of Chowdhry\u2019s best moments come when he\u2019s playing with what is and isn\u2019t acceptable, particularly for the well-meaning, politically correct white people in the audience. \u201cI thought Dave was about to leave,\u201d he says, using his name for a generic white man. Then he puts on \u201cDave\u2019s\u201d cockney accent: \u201cNah, I can\u2019t take this bollocks, I don\u2019t know if I should or shouldn\u2019t laugh at this shit.\u201d Intent is key, he says. \u201cWhen I [was on the circuit], comics would say: \u2018I\u2019m not going to do that joke about disabled people because there\u2019s a disabled person in the front row,\u2019 and I\u2019d go: \u2018Well, then it\u2019s offensive. If you can\u2019t do it in front of them, you shouldn\u2019t be doing the joke, mate.\u2019\u201d He has a talent for accents \u2013 he will do people from different regions of India, Nigerians, and so on. \u201cI\u2019m not doing a Jim Davidson Chalky act,\u201d he says, referring to the deeply unpleasant comedian whose West Indian character, Chalky White, was a crude racist stereotype. Chowdhry says he has \u201clived amongst people like this\u201d, meaning people of different ethnicities, \u201cand a lot of the material was written by talking to them. If a white comic did an Indian accent, would it work in front of an Indian audience? I think it could. A lot of it is intent.\u201d Chowdhry\u2019s impression of working-class Dave is another thing he will try to unpick in his new show, he says. \u201cA guy comes up to me and goes [he puts on his cockney accent]: \u2018How come you can do my accent and I\u2019m not allowed to do a \u2018bud bud ding ding\u2019 accent?\u2019\u201d But it\u2019s about so much more than race \u2013 class, equality, punching up or down. Nobody ever criticises him for doing a posh white guy. \u201cBut how come no one\u2019s ever had a go at me for doing Dave? No one\u2019s ever said: \u2018Paul Chowdhry does a cockney accent and I was offended,\u2019\u201d says the man with a voice, a following, a nearly sold-out tour, and a gardener. \u201cPeople could argue that was punching down.\u201d Paul Chowdhry tours the UK with his new show, Live Innit, from 1 September"
"9||Is Donald Trump finally about to act on America's opioid crisis?If Donald Trump declares America\u2019s opioid addiction crisis a national emergency, as a White House commission urged him to do earlier this week, it could mark a dramatic escalation in the administration\u2019s response. \u201cThink what we would do in this country if Zika and Ebola were taking 100 lives every single day,\u201d said Gary Mendell, the CEO of Shatterproof, a nonprofit working to end addiction. \u201cWe would call it a national emergency and we would marshal all the resources of federal agencies to attack the issue,\u201d Mendell told the Guardian. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what needs to happen here.\u201d Formal emergency declarations are rarely used on a national scale, and are typically reserved for natural disasters and infectious diseases such as H1N1 virus. But Monday\u2019s draft report by a bipartisan commission led by New Jersey governor Chris Christie suggests the situation was serious enough to warrant such a dramatic step, as 91 Americans die each day from an opioid overdose. An emergency declaration would empower the government to quickly expand access to in-patient treatment services and negotiate lower prices for the overdose reversal drug naloxone, according to the report. It could also cut out some bureaucracy to expedite data-sharing, funds distribution and laws that improve access to treatment. Six states have used mechanisms similar to a federal emergency declaration to respond to the opioid crisis at a local level. The declarations helped Florida, Maryland, Arizona, Virginia, Alaska and Massachusetts expand access to the overdose reversal drug naloxone, improve reporting of overdose deaths, institute prescription drug monitoring programs and allocate funds for addiction services. Jay Butler, the chief medical officer of Alaska\u2019s health department, coordinated the implementation of the state\u2019s emergency declaration, which was in effect for 30 days. Butler said it improved coordination between agencies and expanded access to naloxone \u2013 something the commission has recommended be done on a nationwide scale. Butler, who is also president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), told the Guardian that a federal state of emergency \u201cnicely puts into context the magnitude of the issue\u201d, but he was not clear how such a declaration would be managed at the federal level. \u201cIf there are no additional resources \u2013 funding, personnel \u2013 it will be at the price of compromising the response to other priorities, such as Zika virus,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThe public health infrastructure cannot bear additional load without upkeep.\u201d Others are concerned about how a national emergency would be used by the Trump administration, which has so far favored policies that could undermine efforts to curb addiction \u2013 such as limiting access to healthcare, harshly penalizing drug users and cutting funds for agencies tasked with addressing the crisis. \u201cThe report issued this week demonstrates how far out of touch the Trump administration has been with respect to its drug policy and its policy towards addressing the opioid crisis,\u201d Grant Smith, deputy director of national affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance, told the Guardian. The contradictions between the administration\u2019s policies and evidence-based solutions, such as medication-assisted treatment and expanded access to addiction treatment, have plagued the commission since it was organized in March. At the commission\u2019s first meeting in June, nearly every speaker explained to an audience that included senior Trump advisors Kellyanne Conway and Jared Kushner that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 something Republicans have so far tried but failed to achieve \u2013 would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the opioid crisis response. \u201cIf we make it harder and more expensive for people to get healthcare coverage, it\u2019s going to make this crisis worse,\u201d said North Carolina governor and commission member, Roy Cooper. In May, the US health secretary, Tom Price, said that using medication assisted treatment was \u201csubstituting one opioid for another\u201d, prompting nearly 700 researchers and practitioners to demand a clarification of his statement, which he eventually walked back from. The health department also clarified that it supports medication assisted treatment. Other key agencies tasked with responding to the crisis have been hampered by threats to cut funding and leadership vacancies. The White House proposed cutting 95% of funding to the Office of National Drug Control Policy in its original budget proposal, but restored most of the funding in a revised budget plan after facing widespread backlash from Republicans and Democrats. Trump also fired US surgeon general Vivek Murthy in April, months after his office published a nonpartisan report on addiction, and his position has not been filled. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only just appointed a new director after Thomas Frieden resigned from the post on inauguration day. Outside of the administration\u2019s health infrastructure, drug policy experts are concerned about the policies of attorney general Jeff Sessions. He has long supported punitive drug policies that harken back to the war on drugs, which has been discredited as a failure. In May, Sessions directed federal prosecutors to pursue the harshest possible sentences for drug crimes, a move seen as a return to drug-war policies. And two days after the report was released, Sessions advocated for a southern border wall to stem the flow of drugs, an effort promoted heavily by the president, though it was not mentioned in the commission report and is not expected to significantly reduce drug abuse in the US. Smith, of the Drug Policy Alliance, said: \u201cA national emergency declaration \u2013 will it be used in the way that the commission intends it to be used or will it be used to further the agenda that attorney general Sessions pursued?\u201d"
"1||Chess: Hou Yifan advances challenge to Polgar\u2019s No1 status with victory in BielThe standout result of the week has been at the traditional annual tournament at Biel in Switzerland, where the 23-year-old Hou Yifan, the No1 woman, won a historic first prize with 6.5/9 and a 2810 performance rating. Hou was seeded only seventh but outpaced India\u2019s No2, Pentala Harikrishna, as well as the former candidates Peter Leko and Alex Morozevich. She did it in style, too, with a widely acclaimed sacrificial sequence against the veteran Rafael Vaganian. A year or two ago Hou was considering a Rhodes scholarship at Oxford to continue her academic studies on international relations. At the start of 2017 her strange final game at Tradewise Gibraltar, where she opened 1 g4 and resigned in five moves as a protest against the pairings, attracted headlines. Just a few weeks ago she did badly in the Fide Grand Prix at Geneva, so her Biel result is quite a turn-around. Hou\u2019s performances are inevitably matched against Judit Polgar, the all-time female No1, whose lifetime rating peak of 2735 was nearly 50 points higher than Hou\u2019s best and who in 2005 played in a tournament against men for the world championship. Most comparisons favour Polgar but at Tradewise Gibraltar 2012 Hou shared first with Nigel Short, had a 2872 performance rating and defeated the Hungarian the only time they met. The quality of Hou\u2019s Biel result is on a par with Polgar\u2019s best all-play-all tournament win at Madrid 1994, a 2774 performance. At 23 years old Hou will be encouraged to continue her quest to achieve new peaks for women in chess. Meanwhile this weekend Magnus Carlsen, the world champion, is in action in the Sinquefield Cup at St Louis while the British championship reaches its final rounds at Llandudno. Free and live internet viewing, with expert and computer commentaries, is available for both events, nicely scheduled for the armchair spectator with Llandudno starting at 2.30 pm and St Louis at 7pm UK time. The British championship enters its final two rounds on Saturday and Sunday with the No3 seed, Luke McShane, a narrow favourite after his earlier win against David Howell knocked the top seed almost out of contention. The leaders are McShane and John Emms 6/7, Gawain Jones, Nick Pert, Danny Gormally and Craig Hanley 5.5, while Howell is in the chasing pack on 5. McShane, 33, is an England Olympiad player but works as a financial trader so has not competed in the championship since he was a teenager in 2002. The new format, reducing the event from 11 rounds and two weeks to nine rounds and one week, has made the difference. He will be paired with his co-leader, the veteran Kent grandmaster Emms, 50, in Saturday\u2019s penultimate round and could meet the No2 seed Jones in Sunday\u2019s final round. There is a \u00a310,000 first prize at stake, so internet viewers can look forward to an interesting weekend\u2019s entertainment, with a tie for first and a speed play-off a significant possibility. GM Nick Pert\u2019s first round 15-move miniature against the Chelmsford sixth-former Daniel Gallagher, who was fresh from scoring 4.5/5 on top board for England juniors in the Glorney Cup, was in a style reminiscent of how the legend Alexander Alekhine used to demolish opponents in the 1920s. Gallagher, Black, prepared the sharp Blumenfeld Gambit but Pert was ready and his rare 5 e4!? has better results than the usual 5 Bg5 or accepting the pawn by 5 dxe6 fxe6 6 cxb5 when Black acquires a strong pawn centre by d7-d5. Gallagher had another option at move seven with 7...bxc4 8 Bxc4 Ba6 9 Bxa6 Nxa6 10 0-0 Nc7 11 d6 Nd5 12 Re1 Qa5 planning light square play with the tactical point 13 Qxd5? Qxa1+! However, it was Black\u2019s next two turns which really did the damage. Instead of 8\u2026exd5 he again had the chance for 7\u2026bxc4 and could also try 8\u2026Bb7 9 Nxb5 exd5 10 cxd5 Bxd5 11 Bf4 d6 12 Re1 0-0. One move later, Black could return his extra pawn by 9\u2026d6 10 Bxb5+ Bd7 when White has an edge but much play remains. Given his opportunity, Pert struck with 10 d6! and 11 Be4! when the black king is already in the firing line and Black\u2019s best bet is to give up rook for knight by 11\u2026bxc3. Later, Gallagher could have prolonged the game by 14\u2026f6 but instead collapsed and resigned rather than wait for 16 Rae1! g6 17 Re8+ Kg7 18 Rxh8 Kxh8 19 Qxa8 and the massacre of his army. Nick Pert v Daniel Gallagher 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3 c5 3 d5 e6 4 c4 b5 5 e4!? Nxe4 6 Bd3 Nf6 7 Nc3 Be7 8 O-O exd5? 9 cxd5 b4? 10 d6! Bxd6 11 Be4! Nxe4? 12 Nxe4 Be7 13 Nd6+ Kf8 14 Bg5! Bxg5? 15 Qd5! Qf6 1-0 3506 1...Qa4! wins a rook. The game ended 2 Qxa4 Nf3 mate."
"1||Sebastian Coe alarmed by \u2018human trafficking\u2019 revelations in athleticsSebastian Coe has said he is deeply concerned by revelations about African runners being bought by richer nations and exploited, urging the IAAF\u2019s Athletics Integrity Unit to investigate the issue as soon as possible. As the Guardian revealed in a joint investigation with the German broadcaster ARD and Holland Media Combination, a growing number of Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes have been lured to transfer their national allegiance to countries such as Azerbaijan and Bahrain \u2013 only for prize money to be stolen, their movements restricted and to be treated \u201clike slaves\u201d. Speaking as the London 2017 world championships began, the head of the sport\u2019s world governing body said he had read the athletes\u2019 stories with mounting horror. \u201cWe can\u2019t have an element of our sport that has descended into human trafficking,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThis is just basic human rights \u2013 and it has to be addressed.\u201d Lord Coe also said the wider issue of athletes transferring allegiance was a problem, especially those switching for no obvious reason beyond a cynical attempt by oil-rich nations to increase their chances of winning medals on the world stage. However, he pointed out the IAAF had moved to suspend such transfers on 6 February and that he wanted to make it much tougher for them to happen in the future. \u201cWe start off from a very basic principle \u2013 that if an athlete starts competing in a country there has to be a very good reason why they cease to compete for that country and compete for another country,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there may be some really strong extenuating circumstances for a council to be sensitive to political and cultural sensitivities and realities. But I can\u2019t have a situation where I have got a federation president reporting to me that most mornings he is waking up to emails from their athletes who are looking for flags of convenience. \u201cThis is complicated but we do need to make these processes a lot tougher, a lot tighter and, yes, give chances for genuine athletes to move,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be done on the basis of two federations agreeing and an athlete running in a completely different uniform than they were running in six weeks ago. \u201cThe transfer of allegiance issue isn\u2019t just about some athlete being tapped up by another country because they have a shortage of 5,000m runners. As the Guardian has revealed this is also impacting on young athletes when they certainly should have more structures around them.\u201d Coe said the recently formed Athletics Integrity Unit, chaired by the former Wada director general David Howman, would investigate. \u201cThis is really good journalism and I am encouraging the Guardian and the athletes to share it with the Athletics Integrity Unit. That is exactly what they are there for and it\u2019s exactly why I set it up to share such information.\u201d One such case involved Leonard Mucheru, a Kenyan distance runner, who moved to Bahrain in 2003 only to discover the promises made when he agreed to switch allegiance were not going to be honoured. \u201cI began to feel like a slave,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we got to Bahrain we realised that these guys could not allow you to go in a shop, to go to an entertainment joint. They would take your passport.\u201d Coe, a double Olympic champion, said he was lucky to come from a caring home and an environment that showed proper paternalistic interest. \u201cThe thought that some of these athletes \u2013 who are even younger than my children \u2013 are in that environment makes me curl up both as a parent and as a president,\u201d he said."
"15||NHS finds bed for teenager at risk of suicideThe NHS has found a hospital to look after the suicidal 17-year-old girl whose plight led a judge to warn that the country would have \u201cblood on our hands\u201d if a bed could not be located. Dr Mike Prentice, NHS England\u2019s medical director for its north of England region, said: \u201cFollowing extensive assessments, the NHS has identified a bed for this young woman in a safe and appropriate care setting which will best meet her needs.\u201d Sir James Munby, the president of the family division of the high court, warned on Thursday that the girl, known only as X, could commit suicide within 48 hours of being released from detention on 14 August if mental health services could not find a place for her to receive intensive treatment. The girl was likely to be moved to the unidentified \u201clow secure\u201d mental health unit before she was due to be released. \u201cThe bed will be available ahead of the release date,\u201d Prentice said. The announcement came a day after Munby said the girl\u2019s situation demonstrated the country\u2019s \u201cdisgraceful and utterly shaming\u201d lack of proper mental health provision. His judgment explained X had made a large number of \u201cdetermined attempts\u201d on her life. She was due to be released from a secure unit, named as ZX, and doctors believed she needed to be placed in further care for her own protection. \u201cIf, when in 11 days\u2019 time she is released from ZX, we, the system, society, the state, are unable to provide X with the supportive and safe placement she so desperately needs, and if, in consequence, she is enabled to make another attempt on her life, then I can only say, with bleak emphasis: we will have blood on our hands,\u201d Munby wrote. Mental health experts welcomed the news of the placement, but urged MPs and NHS bosses to take X\u2019s situation as a prompt to increase support for highly troubled young people who need residential care. \u201cIt is a great relief to hear that a suitable bed has been found for patient X. We must learn from this situation and keep up the momentum on this issue,\u201d said Prof Wendy Burn, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. \u201cSecuring the right support for others like X should not be, and cannot be, dependent on one of the highest judges in the land showcasing his outrage and frustration. We urgently need to devise a national strategy so that people with personality disorders are supported from their adolescence into adulthood.\u201d Young Minds, a charity which tackles mental health problems among the under-25s, said more needed to be done to stop children and young people ending up in a mental health crisis. Tom Madders, the director of campaigns, said: \u201cThis shocking story has highlighted the gaps in the system where young people and families are left waiting at each stage for referrals and assessments, sometimes even in crisis, as X was. \u201cWe need to make sure that the young people can get the support they need when they need it, whether they are in crisis or at the first point that they reach out for help.\u201d Munby had said the low secure unit best suited to X\u2019s complex needs did not have a bed available for another six months. But after examining three hospitals as possible options, NHS England officials had chosen one of them for her. The girl\u2019s need to undergo intensive therapy for her personality disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and the serious risk of her making further suicide attempts, mean she could be moved as soon as this weekend, experts believe. Of the 1,459 children and adolescent mental health services inpatient beds available in England, 124 are suitable for patients, such as X, who have challenging conditions and are deemed a risk to others, or themselves, or both. But the long time that patients spend receiving treatment in such units \u2013 between three and 18 months \u2013 means the beds do not become available often."
"16||Hats off to craft skills \u2013\u00a0before they disappear for goodIt is a craft that requires imagination, concentration and precision. And, when you are about to plunge a chisel into a wonderfully smooth piece of lime wood, a degree of boldness. Owen Morse-Brown, whose workshop is tucked away on a light industrial estate in Wiltshire, is one of the last British artisans blessed with the skills to create wooden hat blocks \u2013 moulds for headwear ranging from the sort of creations Ascot racegoers sport to trilbies, fedoras, bowlers, porkpies and Bretons. Morse-Brown\u2019s craft is one of 17 that has been placed on a \u201cred list\u201d judged by the Heritage Craft Association to be critically endangered. The association claims that crafts such as shaping clay pipes and carving clogs are at serious risk of no longer being practised and is calling on the government to take action. It says that unless something is done many crafts will follow the handmaking of cricket balls and lacrosse sticks into its \u201cextinct\u201d category. Greta Bertram, who led the red list research on behalf of the Heritage Crafts Association, said: \u201cWe would like to see the government recognise the importance of traditional craft skills as part of our cultural heritage, and take action to ensure they are passed on to the next generation. \u201cCraft skills today are in the same position that historic buildings were a hundred years ago. We recognise the importance of old buildings as part of our heritage, and it\u2019s time for us to join the rest of the world and recognise that these living cultural traditions are just as important and need safeguarding too.\u201d Morse-Brown agreed. \u201cCrafting and traditional skills are hugely important,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking things and passing on knowledge through the generations is part of what makes us human.\u201d Up until the 1940s and 50s, hats were commonly made on wooden moulds. \u201cEverybody wore a hat,\u201d said Morse-Brown. \u201cSo millions of blocks were needed for every style, every size. But things changed.\u201d Hats tend to be made on metal moulds that can be heated. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot quicker and less manual like almost everything,\u201d Morse-Brown said. According to the Heritage Craft Association, cheap Chinese imports are also to blame and its red list says there are only between one and five hat block makers left in the UK. Owen took over the business from his father, Guy Morse-Brown, a decade ago. Until then he had specialised in making viols and other early stringed instruments but his father tutored him in the very particular requirements of hat block making. The type of wood is important. For most blocks French lime timber is used because it is soft enough to take a pin when the hat is being made. An African hardwood is used for larger blocks as it is lighter to handle. Wood arrives in planks and is sawed and glued to create square blocks. Each piece is then chiselled, gouged and sanded into the required shape by hand. The Morse-Brown blocks are used by high-end milliners and by film and theatre costume makers. But most \u2013 perhaps about 75% \u2013 are now bought by hobbyists who create their own hats. \u201cMost are Ascot or wedding hats, but over the last few years there has been an increase in people wanting to make men\u2019s hats, which is fantastic,\u201d said Morse-Brown. He can sometimes be spotted strolling around his hometown of Devizes in a natty handmade hat, his favourite a brown, long-haired bowler decorated with feathers. The Morse-Brown catalogue boasts about 500 styles and shapes and the blocks range from about \u00a350 to \u00a3350. A week rarely goes by without a customer ordering a new style of hat block.Block of the month on the Morse Brown website is currently FB57 \u2013 which allows the creation of a headband-style \u201chat\u201d. Morse-Brown talks passionately about the art of making sure the lines and proportions are correct and how the play of light on a block can help the craftsperson make sure new design will work. \u201cThe skill base is very particular,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to know about hat making or you will make shapes that don\u2019t work.\u201d While hat block making is on the red list, the Morse-Brown business is doing well. It moved to bigger premises in 2014 and a couple of part-time workers are employed. But will the craft be passed down to a new generation? \u201cI\u2019ve got three children and the middle one is pretty keen on doing it,\u201d said Morse-Brown. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Dying arts This is the list of crafts classified as \u201ccritically endangered\u201d by Heritage Craft Association \u2013 ie at serious risk of no longer being practised. They include crafts with a shrinking base of craftspeople, with limited training opportunities, with low financial viability, and crafts where there is no mechanism to pass on the skills and knowledge. Clay pipe making Clog making (hand-carved soles) Coachbuilding and wagon making (horse drawn vehicles) Collar making (for horses traditionally with a leather outer and rye straw filling) Devon maund making (a basket made of wooden splints) Fan making Fore edge painting (the application of an image to the edges of the pages of a book) Hat block making Metal thread making Paper marbling (the application of an aqueous surface design on to paper, which can produce patterns similar to smooth marble or other kinds of stone) Parchment and vellum making Piano making Plane making Saw making Spade making (forged heads) Swill basket making (from woven strips of cleft oak) Tanning oak bark (the process of using oak bark tanning to convert raw hide/skin into leather)"
"7||Mark Sampson's cult of positivity left in debris of England\u2019s Euro 2017 heartbreakOn the stroke of 8am, a uniformed attendant parked his van alongside the FanZone and surveyed a grisly scene. After pausing momentarily, he began painstakingly clearing the mini-mountain of litter scarring a usually serene patch of grass, bisecting a pleasant square. Bit by bit the polystyrene cartons, beer cans, cigarette ends and empty pizza boxes scarring this corner of downtown Enschede disappeared. Around 90 miles to the west, another type of Friday morning cleanup was similarly underway at England\u2019s Utrecht base. As Holland fans partied late in the FanZone following the Oranje\u2019s 3-0 semi-final deconstruction of Mark Sampson\u2019s side here on Thursday, the Lionesses, several tearful, were driven back to their hotel for one final night in the Netherlands. Once dawn broke, members of the squad\u2019s near two-dozen strong contingent of Football Association support staff got to work. Scores of touching brightly crayoned and felt-tipped messages of support from assorted English junior girls\u2019 teams adorning the Lionesses\u2019 training ground swiftly disappeared. Following a sleepless night, Sampson must wished that his emotions, too, could have been neatly compartmentalised in black bin bags but, instead, a painful inquest as to why England, once again, fell short was just beginning. As arrangements were made for the return of an expensively rented cryotherapy chamber and hotel executives admired the costly gymnasium bequeathed to them by the FA, the coach refused to be drawn on his future. Sounding tired, the 34-year-old talked of wanting to spend more time with his family. Given that his partner and baby daughter were based in Utrecht throughout the tournament and they regularly enjoyed free time together, it seemed a flimsy reason for declining to confirm he would complete a contract running until 2019. Sampson\u2019s public utterances are rarely accidental and it is safe to assume the Welshman knew his ambivalent stance would attract attention. So, is he upset about the response of certain FA officials to his comments before the group game against Spain and the quarter-final against France in which he denounced Iberian dark arts and claimed Olivier Echouafni, the French coach, was wet behind the ears? While it is near unthinkable that Sampson could be sacked, there was disquiet among some senior FA officials about the coach\u2019s provocative stance, with his suggestion that Echouafni should learn \u201cwho to talk about and who not to talk about\u201d going down particularly badly. Perhaps a man previously regarded as a potential Under-21 men\u2019s coach has been stung by the resultant censure and wants a re-affirmation of his employers\u2019 faith before preparations begin for the 2019 World Cup in France? Or maybe he is about to be poached by someone else? It could be that Sampson is so devastated by a defeat he did not see coming that he needs time to reflect on what to do next. This period of contemplation will surely involve some angst about those bullish outbursts that proved poor representations of his nuanced intelligence, humour, humility and refreshing openness. Were his jibes provoked by the pressure of feeling that he needed to win a trophy to help justify the FA\u2019s substantial investment in women\u2019s football \u2013 (at \u00a317.7m this year it is, by some distance, the highest in Europe) \u2013 or had finishing third at the 2015 World Cup in Canada gone to his head a little? Did he pay too much attention to sports psychologists and the cult of positivity? Was it really wise to constantly bang on about winning the tournament and being on a mission to become the best team in the world? Throw in frequent mentions of history, legacy and destiny and it all became a bit over-powering. Should Sampson have parted company with his erstwhile assistant, Marieanne Spacey, in June? The 51-year-old former England striker, immediately re-employed in a new FA coaching role, offered her young boss wise counsel when England impressed in Canada. Curiously, Spacey turned up to watch the Spain game with a hoodie pulled high over her head and an inscrutable expression on her face. A clever and courageous coach, there are shades of Sam Allardyce\u2019s and Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s cunning in Sampson\u2019s ability to make his team exceed the sum of its parts and find a way to win. Yet if England deserve considerable credit for dominating Group D before beating France for the first time since 1974, a definite discomfiture in possession let them down. Holland\u2019s staff labelled the Lionesses a long-ball outfit and, despite the stellar talents of the outstanding Jodie Taylor, Lucy Bronze and Jordan Nobbs, they certainly looked it as, badly missing the suspended Jill Scott, they froze in a sea of exultant orange on Thursday. It is possible to argue that things might have been different had Sampson \u2013 strangely not as tactically innovative as he was in Canada \u2013 relocated the influential Nobbs to central midfield to replace Scott and introduced the gifted Karen Carney wide on the right but, ultimately, suspect ball retention cost England dear. Following a six-week pre-tournament training camp, staged partly in Valencia \u2013 and despite a reputed 23% improvement in fitness after working with a rugby union coach \u2013 they hit a wall when confronted with opponents able to equal them physically and eclipse them technically. Plus \u00e7a change."
"8||Melting glaciers in Swiss Alps could reveal hundreds of mummified corpsesSwiss police say hundreds of bodies of mountaineers who have gone missing in the Alps in the past century could emerge in coming years as global warming forces the country\u2019s glaciers to retreat. Alpine authorities have registered a significant increase in the number of human remains discovered last month, with the body of a man missing for 30 years the most recent to be uncovered. Rescue teams in Saas Valley in the Valais canton were called last Tuesday after two climbers retreating from an aborted ascent spotted a hand and two shoes protruding from the Hohlaub glacier. Rescuers spent two hours freeing the mummified body with icepicks and their bare hands, also recovering a silver wristwatch and a ring. A helicopter flew the remains to Bern, where forensics experts matched the DNA to that of a German citizen, born in 1943, who had gone missing on a hike in 11 August 1987. One rescue worker said the man had worn shoes \u201cunsuitable\u201d for walking on ice, suggesting he may have slipped after walking a few metres onto the glacier and fallen down a crevice. Both feet had become detached from the body, indicating the force of the fall. The discovery comes less than a week after the bodies of a Swiss couple, missing for 75 years, were found in the Tsanfleuron glacier in the same canton. Marcelin and Francine Dumoulin had disappeared after going out to milk their cows in a meadow above Chandolin on 15 August 1942. Last Thursday, the remains of a person believed to have been killed in an Air India crash more than 50 years ago was also discovered in the French Alps, on Mount Blanc. Switzerland\u2019s glaciers have been melting at an unprecedented rate, losing almost one cubic km in ice volume or about 900 bn litres of water over the past year. According to an investigation by Tagesanzeiger newspaper, eight of the 10 months in which the glaciers have lost the most in volume over the past century have been since 2008. Since 1850, when glaciers covered 1,735 sq km (670 sq miles) of Swiss land, the total area has shrunk by a half, to about 890 sq km. Police in Valais expect the bodies of many more missing persons to emerge because of global warming. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear,\u201d a spokesman, Christian Zuber, told the Guardian. \u201cThe glaciers are retreating, so it\u2019s logical that we\u2019re finding more and more bodies and body parts. In the coming years we expect that many more cases of missing persons will be resolved.\u201d He said a map that lists everyone who had gone missing since 1925 to the present day contains 306 names and locations, one fewer since the discovery of the German mountaineer. At least 160 alpinists remain missing in France\u2019s Mont Blanc massif, and the Morteratsch glacier in Graub\u00fcnden is believed to contain the bodies of 40 mountaineers. Zuber described the \u201cgreat relief\u201d at being able to pass on the information to the families \u201cwho would otherwise never know with 100% certainty whether their loved one had perished on the mountain. Finally when a corpse is discovered, you have an absolute guarantee\u201d, he said. He said that feeling had also been palpable earlier this year when a local woman was able to retrieve the bodies of her dead parents, the Dumoulins, who had disappeared when she was just four years old. \u201cWe locals are obviously used to the mountains, but such discoveries are no less emotional for the people here,\u201d he said. Rolf Trachsel, head of mountain rescue in Saas-Fee, who led the operation to recover the German man\u2019s body, said it had been discovered in an area popular with hikers. \u201cThere was very little snow, and it was not very steep. It was about half an hour\u2019s hike away from the next mountain cable-car station.\u201d He said although the team had to deal with the sad fact they were recovering a dead man, they also felt considerable relief. \u201cIf someone has gone missing, logic tells you their body has to turn up again one day,\u201d Trachsel said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously good that we can put our efforts into recovering someone, especially after 30 years, and knowing how important it is for the family to find out what happened.\u201d The body was taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine (IRM) at the University of Bern by helicopter for examination and formal identification where it is still being held. Christian Jackowski, a scientist at IRM, said the discovery of human remains was now a regular feature of the Swiss summer holiday season, as climbers started to swarm the Valais region\u2019s ice-covered mountains. Usually bodies emerged from the ice at the top of the glacier, rather than its \u201ctongue\u201d at the bottom of the valley, Jackowski said. The extent to which bodies have been preserved by the ice depends on the circumstances of the person\u2019s demise, with some human remains having been mummified by sunshine and dry winds before being engulfed in ice, while others have been reduced to skeletons. The majority of bodies are trapped in ice, crevices or streams after an accident or a suicide, though some cases are treated in relation to criminal cases. Other bodies could be the victims of military skirmishes. Though Switzerland stayed neutral in world wars one and two, the Mont Blanc massif became a frontline towards the end of the second world war amid intense fighting between the German army and French resistance fighters. In most cases, forensic experts face a race against time once bodies have been removed from the ice and start to thaw. Dental records and DNA samples are checked against a database of missing people to determine the identity of the corpse. Since 2000, authorities in Switzerland have taken DNA samples of missing people\u2019s family members immediately after their disappearance to facilitate the process."
"6||Fairtrade only really benefits supermarkets. A rethink is neededIn response to the growing demand of citizens in developed countries for quality consumption, the proliferation of \u201cethical labels\u201d is simply staggering. For some, the purchase and consumption of goods has become a political act. News that Green &amp; Black\u2019s new chocolate bar will be neither organic nor Fairtrade-certified \u2013 instead, the beans have been sourced via certified scheme Cocoa Life \u2013 has caused controversy, while the world\u2019s biggest Fairtrade retailer, Sainsbury\u2019s, recently came under fire for dropping the Fairtrade label from its own-brand tea. Most of these so-called ethical retailers and schemes \u2013 Cocoa Lfe included \u2013 are certainly, to my mind, not driven by \u201cethics\u201d. Fairtrade, at least, was a grassroots movement aiming for changes from below, which is not always the case for the ethical labels used by some supermarkets and retailers. Those who introduce ethical labels just want to position themselves in a growing market and make a profit \u2013 and under these conditions, it is not easy for the average consumer to distinguish tares from wheat. The Fairtrade (FT) mark is one of the most well-known and respected labels in the world, with an economic model that aims to improve the living conditions of rural producers of the global south in a solidarity approach with consumers in the north. The objective is to facilitate access to the markets of the north, to guarantee them decent prices and to eliminate the \u201cunfair\u201d middlemen exploiting them. Unfortunately, the FT economic model has significant limitations that continue to generate legitimate criticism. The FT movement is regularly accused of working with companies that have behaved unethically in the past or that are considered symbols of the unfairness of the international trading system. What is often highlighted is the gulf between the principles of the FT movement and its practices. This moral criticism, however, is insufficient. Economic criticism from the perspective of producers is needed as well. The FT economic model faces a structural contradiction. On the one hand, if the minimum price for FT products is high, they may not find outlets. Sales will be low. The economic benefits to producer organisations will also be negligible. On the other hand, if the minimum price of FT products is \u201ccompetitive\u201d, sales may increase but the impact in terms of poverty reduction will be insignificant. Besides, due to the fierce competition caused by the proliferation of labels, the FT movement is induced to \u201clower\u201d its standards \u2013 conservative minimum prices, lower requirements in terms of FT content for composite products, etc \u2013 in the hope of boosting its sales. So, it should not be a surprise that in some contexts, non-FT producers are better off than comparable FT producers. This kind of hard evidence is often downplayed by the FT movement. Faced with the contradiction between the marketing logic of sales growth and the logic of poverty reduction at a very small scale, the FT movement has until now privileged the former. Fairtrade protagonists tend to assert that the FT model is an alternative to the \u201cfree market\u201d \u2013 but the reality is that it is a \u201cparenthesis\u201d within the conventional trading system. Once the rules of the game are laid down (financing, minimum prices, premiums, traceability), market access and prices are determined on a competitive basis, as in the case of conventional trade. FT labelling organisations cannot guarantee that buyers involved in the movement will pay producers\u2019 organisations a price higher than the FT minimum price. Nor can they guarantee that producer organisations can sell all their FT-certified production under FT conditions (payment of minimum prices and premiums). According to figures provided by Fairtrade International for 2013-2014, only 28% of FT coffee was sold in FT markets. Fairtrade bananas are the bestselling product (56%-64%), while FT tea is the least sold product (7%). In other words, supply is higher than demand for all FT products. Owing to free market principles, producer organisations that usually join the FT movement are not necessarily the poorest, but those that can meet market demands \u2013 ie those with the means to afford certification fees and a certain scale of production. No wonder producer organisations from the least developed countries tend to be under-represented. A further issue regarding the FT model is the maintaining of countries of the south in a disadvantageous economic specialisation. While most of them have been exporting primary commodities since colonial times, this has not led to economic transformations beneficial to the vast majority of their populations. The FT movement as a whole would have more impact if it focused on manufactured goods produced using local agricultural products. This type of model would have the advantage of generating productive employment and stimulating technological innovation in the countries of the south. \u2022 Ndongo Samba Sylla is a Senegalese development economist.

"9||Jeff Sessions bows to Trump pressure and launches crackdown on leakersThe US justice department has \u201ctripled the number of active leak investigations\u201d and devoted new FBI resources to cracking down on leakers, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, said in a press conference on Friday, promising also that the department was reviewing its approach to subpoenaing journalists. \u201cWe respect the important role that the press plays and will give them respect, but it is not unlimited. They cannot place lives at risk with impunity,\u201d Sessions warned. \u201cWe must balance their role with protecting our national security and the lives of those who serve in our intelligence community, the armed forces, and all law abiding Americans.\u201d Sessions condemned the \u201cstaggering number of leaks\u201d and said that in the first six months of the Trump administration, the department had already received \u201cnearly as many criminal referrals\u201d involving disclosure of classified information as it had received in the last three years combined. \u201cI have this message for the intelligence community: the Department of Justice is open for business,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cAnd I have this warning for would-be leakers: don\u2019t do it.\u201d After a week of criticism of the attorney general from Donald Trump, who tweeted in late July that Sessions \u201chas taken a VERY weak position...on INTEL leakers!\u201d the press conference served as a public message to the president that he is following Trump\u2019s wishes. Sessions\u2019 announcement was heavy on threats and light on specifics. As the attorney general noted, the department\u2019s practice is not to comment on active investigations. Sessions did highlight one potential policy change: following months of attacks by the president on the press for publishing leaked information from the highest levels of his administration, Sessions said the department was reviewing its policy on subpoenaing journalists. After years of denunciations from news organizations over its own crackdowns on the press, which included secretly subpoenaing months of telephone records of Associated Press reporters and editors, Obama\u2019s justice department announced in 2015 that it was increasing oversight of prosecutors\u2019 choices to obtain records and other information from journalists when pursuing leak investigations. Trump has spent months denouncing the \u201cfake news\u201d media and attacking the press, including individual journalists. The anti-media chants that were a staple of his campaign rallies have continued into the rallies Trump has held as president. News organizations have raised concerns about the broader effects of this undermining of press freedom, particularly after a Republican congressional candidate in Montana slammed Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs to the ground in May. Greg Gianforte, who won the race despite the assault on the eve of the election, later apologized, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to community service. But Sessions\u2019 promise to revisit how journalists will be treated represents a new kind of threat, one that journalists greeted with concern and, in some cases, defiance. \u201cThe guidelines in place carefully balance the interests of both law enforcement and the news media. We strongly oppose DoJ plan to revisit,\u201d the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press tweeted. Trump\u2019s week-long series of public attacks on his attorney general appear to have paused, at least for now. Bloomberg reported that Trump\u2019s new chief of staff John Kelly reassured Sessions in a phone call over the weekend that he would keep his job. Republicans in Congress had pushed back against the president\u2019s attacks on Sessions, with one influential Republican tweeting bluntly that the Senate would not be holding confirmation hearings for a new attorney general this year. \u201cNo way,\u201d Senator Chuck Grassley tweeted. Sessions defended himself in a Fox News interview last week, saying that the president\u2019s attacks were \u201ckind of hurtful\u201d but that he was effectively carrying out the president\u2019s agenda. \u201cThe president has every right to ask the Department of Justice to be more aggressive in that and we intend to,\u201d Sessions told Tucker Carlson, promising \u201cpeople need to go to jail.\u201d Sessions\u2019 press conference came a day after it was reported that special counsel Robert Mueller has empanelled a grand jury in his investigation of links between Trump aides and Russia. Key Trump aide Kellyanne Conway seemed to confirm the existence of the investigative panel on Friday, telling Fox News: \u201cRemember, grand jury investigations are meant to remain secret. So someone leaked it. \u201cIt could been anybody in the grand jury. It could be one of the lawyers. It could be anyone, I suppose. But what really should concern everyone, are these leaks that imperil national security.\u201d Most observers agreed that the existence of a grand jury would be bad news for the president, who could with his aides be subpoenaed to testify before it under oath. Bill Clinton testified to a grand jury over the Monica Lewinsky affair; Richard Nixon did so over Watergate. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Mueller had convened the grand jury in Washington, a sign that investigators are intensifying their work on potential collusion between Trump aides and Moscow. Subsequent reports suggested the grand jury had already subpoenaed documents in relation to the now infamous June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr and a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting, at Trump Tower in Manhattan, also included among others the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, then-campaign manager Paul Manafort, and a former Soviet counter-intelligence officer. The meeting was revealed last month, forcing Trump Jr to make public emails in which he accepted the meeting on the premise of receiving highly sensitive information about Hillary Clinton, his father\u2019s election rival. In the emails, the first public indication Trump aides might have been willing to conspire with Russians, Trump Jr was also explicitly told of an effort by the Kremlin to aid his father\u2019s campaign. The president, who has long refused to acknowledge the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Moscow sought to influence the election, continues to cast the entire investigation as an attempt to delegitimize his victory over Clinton. \u201cHave you seen any Russians in West Virginia, or Ohio, or Pennsylvania?\u201d Trump asked his audience on Thursday. \u201cThey can\u2019t beat us at the voting booths so they\u2019re trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us, and, most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our constitution.\u201d The president\u2019s legal team has reportedly looked into potential conflicts of interest involving Mueller and his team of investigators. In a recent New York Times interview, the president suggested he would soon make such matters public. Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said on Thursday he was unaware of a grand jury. But he took a more congenial approach to the subject than his client. \u201cGrand jury matters are typically secret,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cThe White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr Mueller.\u201d Trump has been publicly critical of Mueller, who was appointed after the president fired FBI director James Comey in relation to the Russia investigation Trump\u2019s hostile approach to the Russia investigation has sparked growing concern on Capitol Hill. On Thursday, two bipartisan groups of senators unveiled legislation that would protect Mueller from being fired by the president."
"16||Late-night hosts on Trump's week: 'He tends to retreat into alternate reality'Late-night hosts on Thursday discussed another damning news cycle for the Trump administration, including the Wall Street Journal report that special counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in the ongoing Russia investigation and the release of leaked transcripts from the president\u2019s phone calls with the Mexican president and Australian prime minister. NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers began: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s presidency was already in a tailspin before today\u2019s bombshell news that the special counsel has impaneled a grand jury in the Russia investigation. \u201cAs we saw throughout the campaign,\u201d he continued, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s political career has been declared dead many times, so it\u2019s important not to get ahead of ourselves.\u201d Meyers went on to explain the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report, which represents a major development in Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into potential collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. \u201cTrump is probably excited because he thinks a grand jury is just a fancier jury,\u201d Meyers joked, before launching into his impersonation of the president. \u201c\u2018So beautiful, not like one of those dump juries. Beautiful, gold, 12 chandeliers.\u2019\u201d The host went on: \u201cAs we know, when things aren\u2019t going well for Trump, he tends to retreat further into his alternate reality, a reality where he is beloved by all and the country is faring better than ever before.\u201d Meyers then discussed some of the president\u2019s more outlandish recent lies, including his claims that the president of the Boy Scouts called him, following his heavily criticized speech at the jamboree, to say it was the best speech ever given to the group. \u201cYesterday, we saw another feature of Trump\u2019s alternate reality: the idea that immigrants are pouring into our country and hurting our economy,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cTrump proposed new legislation cutting legal immigration by half and imposing new language requirements on immigrants before they come here. Naturally, this policy was highly controversial, which meant it was time to bring back a Trump spokesman we haven\u2019t seen in a while: that\u2019s right, I\u2019m talking about Stephen Miller.\u201d Meyers then took aim at the president\u2019s 31-year-old adviser for his particularly abrasive posturing towards the press when discussing the immigration proposal. \u201cHe took to the podium and immediately started fighting with the press,\u201d Meyers said, referring to Miller\u2019s treatment of CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, the Times\u2019 Glenn Thrush, and his comments about the irrelevance of the Emma Lazarus poem on the Statue of Liberty. \u201cMan, I\u2019m surprised to hear that kind of disdain for a statue from a guy that looks that much like a church gargoyle.\u201d \u201cIs there anyone more off-putting than Stephen Miller?\u201d Meyers asked. \u201cHe looks like a mortician\u2019s ghost. He looks like the guy in a prison movie who\u2019s in for eating his family.\u201d Stephen Colbert also discussed the latest development in the special counsel investigation. \u201cRobert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in his investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign,\u201d he began. \u201cNobody has ever said this before: \u2018God, I wish I had jury duty.\u2019 But I\u2019m available! \u201cBut really, how are they ever going to find unbiased people to serve on this jury?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201c\u2019Ma\u2019am, have you ever heard of a man by the name of Donald Trump?\u2019 \u2018No, father never mentioned him in our cave-dwelling cult.\u2019\u201d Colbert continued: \u201cThis news means that the investigation into Russian meddling is kicking up into a higher gear, because grand juries are powerful investigative tools that allow prosecutors to subpoena documents, put witnesses under oath and seek indictments if there is evidence of a crime. So it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s going to be a trial, but it\u2019s a strong indication that something is going to happen.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like picking up a blind date and the first thing they say is, \u2018Hey, I need some condoms,\u2019\u201d Colbert joked. \u201c\u2018Can we swing by the store? No reason.\u2019\u201d Comedy Central\u2019s Trevor Noah also got in on the action, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s Mueller time. It\u2019s about to go down.\u201d \u201cToday must suck for Donald Trump,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI just hope that if the police ever do arrest him they protect his head when they put him in the car. \u201cThis Mueller grand jury thing has capped off honestly a terrible day for Donald Trump, because in the beginning it started like this,\u201d Noah said, referring to leaked transcripts of the president\u2019s phone calls with Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the president of Mexico, and Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister of Australia. He also mentioned that the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has plans to start an investigation into leaks. \u201cYes, and we know that Sessions is conducting a leak investigation because that was leaked,\u201d Noah quipped. \u201cIs there anything this administration won\u2019t leak? \u201cHere\u2019s what Trump actually said to the president of Mexico,\u201d Noah said, before reading the transcript aloud, in which Trump asks the Mexican president to agree not to tell the press his country won\u2019t be paying for the border wall. Trump adds that the wall has created a \u201cpolitical problem\u201d. \u201c\u2018They\u2019re going to say, \u2018Who\u2019s going to pay for the wall, Mr President?\u201d Trump said to Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \u201cWe should both say, \u2018We will work it out.\u2019\u201d Noah concluded: \u201cMexico\u2019s president was like, we ain\u2019t paying for shit, man.\u201d"
"18||John Heeley obituaryMy friend and colleague John Heeley, who has died aged 65 of bowel cancer, was a leader in the development of tourism in some of the UK\u2019s major cities, especially in Sheffield. He started his career as an academic in tourism but switched to working in the field. It was thanks to John that Sheffield introduced visitor trails, factory tourism visits, heritage plaques, and walking tours to capitalise on the city\u2019s rich industrial heritage. He also prompted successful bids to host conferences and international events, including the 1993 European swimming championships and 1995 Special Olympics. John was born in Parsons Cross, Sheffield, the son of Gordon Heeley, a footwear retailer, and his wife, Eve (nee Edmonds), a nurse. He was brought up in Wisewood and attended Malin Bridge primary, Wisewood secondary modern and Sheffield Central technical school. He took a degree in sociology from York University, graduating in 1972, and went on to get an MSc in tourism at the University of Strathclyde. He then achieved a PhD in tourism and local government from the University of East Anglia, finishing in 1981. He worked as a lecturer in tourism at Strathclyde from 1978 to 1990. Having established a successful academic career John took the step in 1990, at the age of 38, to move into what he referred to as the \u201creal world\u201d by taking the post of managing director of Destination Sheffield, a public-private partnership. Here, he led the transformation of the city\u2019s thinking about its role as a tourist destination. After nearly seven years in Sheffield he went on to perform similar roles in Coventry, Birmingham and Nottingham. He encouraged councillors, officials, the media and the citizens to recognise the wealth in their cultural and natural heritage. This experience brought him to the attention of a wide audience. In 2009 he became Interim CEO of the European Cities Marketing organisation and he established a consultancy, Best Destination Marketing, providing much sought-after advice for cities across the UK and Europe. Toward the end of his career he returned to the academic world at Sheffield Hallam University as visiting fellow, and the University of Strathclyde made him a visiting professor. Apart from city tourism, John\u2019s other passions were for his home city of Sheffield. He also had great affection for Scotland and was a keen hill walker. He was a lover of literature and poetry. He is survived by Alison (nee Gillies), whom he married in 1977, and their children, Stephen, Gillian and Jennifer, and by his sister and brother."
"7||Liverpool\u2019s Adam Lallana to miss \u2018at least two months\u2019 due to thigh injuryLiverpool have confirmed that Adam Lallana will miss the start of the Premier League season due to a thigh injury, with the England international expected to be out for up to two months. Lallana, who scored eight league goals last season as Liverpool finished fourth, picked up the injury during Liverpool\u2019s Audi Cup final defeat on penalties against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Wednesday. The 29-year-old was replaced at half-time as a precaution but a statement from J\u00fcrgen Klopp on Friday confirmed he will miss next week\u2019s opening match against Watford. \u201cThis is certainly not news we would have wanted,\u201d the manager said. \u201cUnfortunately, the damage is such that it will likely mean Adam is out for a couple of months not weeks, so I think we can pretty much rule him out of August and September. \u201cBeyond that we will monitor and wait and see. He is a boy with a world-class attitude to everything professionally and he has always come back in good time from injury setbacks since I have been here, so we will see.\u201d Liverpool are also monitoring Philippe Coutinho\u2019s back niggle which has forced him to miss Saturday\u2019s friendly against Athletic Bilbao in Dublin. Meanwhile Klopp has welcomed a Champions League clash with Hoffenheim, admitting he felt in advance he would be heading home in the play-off round. Liverpool will go to Germany for the opening leg on 15 August before hosting Hoffenheim at Anfield eight days later. \u201cVery interesting. Actually it was exactly what I expected when I had a look. If there\u2019s a choice, we always seem to take the German team. Sorry!\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIt was clear from the first moment when we knew who we could face that there would be no easy game. It\u2019s Hoffenheim and that\u2019s for sure not an easy game. \u201cBut we should always not forget what they thought in the moment they saw the draw. It\u2019s not the best thing they could get. I\u2019m completely fine with it, happy to know and now we can start preparing. \u201cThey are a strong side, how everybody can imagine. When you are fourth in Germany you are a strong side. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting club. They have a lot of really good young players. They lost two of them, Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Sule to Bayern Munich and had a little change. They have a very young manager, Julian Nagelsmann, just 30 years old, a very talented man. First we\u2019ll play Watford but at the same time we\u2019ll start preparing for Hoffenheim and it\u2019s really exciting.\u201d The tie pitches Roberto Firmino against his former club as the Brazilian striker spent four seasons at Hoffenheim before joining Liverpool in 2015. Klopp has a mixed record versus Hoffenheim \u2013 winning five, drawing six and losing five of the 16 games with them while he was in charge of Mainz and Borussia Dortmund \u2013 but Liverpool have fared well against German opposition. Liverpool have progressed from 14 of 16 two-legged knockout ties against German opposition and are fresh from visiting the country at a pre-season training camp. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful region. Hoffenheim is more a village than a city,\u201d Klopp told Liverpoolfc.com. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely settled Bundesliga club. It\u2019s not too far away from my home, the area where I grew up. It\u2019s a really wonderful region, 100 per cent, a nice stadium.\u201d Celtic\u2019s reward for their third qualifying round victory over Rosenborg is once again to make the near 8,000-mile round trip to Kazakhstan. Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side played Astana in the Champions League last season, drawing 1-1 away before winning the Parkhead return 2-1 thanks to a last-gasp Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 penalty. \u201cWe are happy with it,\u201d Celtic\u2019s manager said of the draw. \u201cIt was always going to be a tough game wherever you play. The beauty for us on this one is it is not the unknown. We played them last year and qualified at the beginning of our journey, so we know what it is like out there: hotel, astroturf pitch, virtually the same players. It will be as tough as last year but we look forward to it and will be ready for it.\u201d Celtic will host the first leg on 16 August before the away game in Astana six days later. Meanwhile Ronald Koeman insists Everton will be prepared for the challenge of Hajduk Split in the Europa League. Everton face the Croatian club in the final play-off round as they aim to reach the group stages of the competition that Manchester United won last season. The first leg is scheduled for Goodison Park on 17 August before Koeman\u2019s team travel to the 35,000-capacity Stadion Poljud on 24 August. \u201cHajduk Split will be a real challenge, with their strong support and a stadium that is good to play football in,\u201d Koeman told Everton\u2019s official website. \u201cBut of course we want to reach the group stages of the Europa League, so we will have analysed their strengths and weaknesses between now and the tie and we will be prepared.\u201d"
"19||UK car industry facing an 'utterly demoralising' BrexitAs the latest car figures show that uncertainty over Brexit is helping to drag down sales, motor manufacturers fear the industry\u2019s revival over the past couple of decades could be put at risk by Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said: \u201cA lot of people have spent the best part of decades turning round the industry, when you think back to how it was characterised in the 70s, 80s and into the 90s. It is very different now. It has had very difficult times and it is a cyclical industry, and there is a fear that that success could be put at jeopardy.\u201d He said investments could be curtailed and the industry \u2013 which was overwhelmingly in favour of remaining \u2013 was also facing a multi-million pound bill for planning for the consequences of Brexit. Before the referendum a survey of the SMMT\u2019s 700 members, which include manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover, Nissan and Toyota as well as small and medium sized supply chain companies, found that 80% wanted Britain to stay in the EU, with only 10% backing leave. Hawes said the vote was \u201ca shock to everybody,\u201d and now \u201cpeople have gone beyond bewilderment\u201d to try and work out what the potential impact will be. \u201cThere is significant cost because every company has to do a certain level of modelling and planning for risk,\u201d he said, warning that smaller companies did not always have the resources to do this work. While impossible to quantify precisely, Hawes said the cost must be multi-millions of pounds already, including for consultants advising on Brexit implications. This work is almost entirely negative, he said, because it involves looking at future possibilities all considered worse than the frictionless relationship the industry currently has with the EU. And even though the effects of Brexit might not be immediate, that did not mean they could be shrugged off. \u201cWe always said there will not be an immediate closure of plants because the investments are fixed for many companies,\u201d Hawes said. \u201cThe impact is always going to be more gradual, and you are seeing that now: prices going up, demand is softening, investment decisions are on hold.\u201d New investment in the UK was also at risk, he said, due to overseas companies facing questions about whether Britain will have new tariffs and bureaucratic customs barriers, and the \u201cintangible\u201d factor of whether they would feel welcome: \u201cIf you weren\u2019t currently producing in the EU and you were looking to expand your presence into the EU, you probably wouldn\u2019t come to the UK first and foremost.\u201d Since the decline of British-owned car companies in the 1980s, the UK automotive industry has been rebuilt by overseas manufacturers investing in operations based on frictionless integration of products and people with other European countries, and no tariffs or regulatory barriers. SMMT\u2019s most recent figures state that 814,000 people are employed in the UK industry, which in 2015 turned over \u00a372bn and exported \u00a334bn worth of products, with 56% of car exports and 65% of components going to EU countries. Recently the SMMT announced that investment in the first six months of this year had reduced to just \u00a3322m, from a total of \u00a31.66bn invested last year and \u00a32.5bn in 2015. Hawes said that while the huge investments made by major manufacturers make it unlikely they will leave, there was a risk of smaller suppliers, which are more \u201cfleet of foot,\u201d leaving the UK. \u201cIt would just be utterly demoralising to lose so many of those advantages and the progress we have made, and that is the general feeling in the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will rise to the challenge but ideally we want to have as many of the benefits as we currently enjoy because that has helped make the industry successful.\u201d Hawes said the debate about Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU and discussion since the referendum betrayed ignorance among politicians, citing the use of the phrase \u201caccess to the single market,\u201d which he said meant being outside it, facing customs and regulatory barriers. \u201cThere was a lot of language bandied around, and in the prime minister\u2019s speech to the party conference [in October] she said we want business to \u2018trade with and [operate] within the single market\u2019 \u2013 how you are going to square that circle I don\u2019t know.\u201d Hawes said he does not believe people have understood that Britain\u2019s free trade deals with 57 other countries through the EU\u2019s current agreements will also fall away after Brexit. And he found particularly frustrating the \u201cmisguided\u201d view expressed by some prominent leave campaigners that the German car industry would press chancellor Angela Merkel to give the UK a good EU deal, because they export in significant numbers to Britain. \u201cWe consistently said do not expect that. The European market and to a certain extent the European project is more important to them than the UK, so they want to safeguard the four freedoms which benefit them. If any sector has really benefitted from growth and development across Europe, it\u2019s the German car industry. It is frustrating and it also reveals a lack of understanding of the way markets operate.\u201d Asked if Boris Johnson or Nigel Farage, who both made that argument during the referendum campaign, had discussed it with the car industry first, Hawes said they had not. The government\u2019s engagement with business has changed \u201ca little\u201d since the election, he said, and \u201cthe arguments are landing better.\u201d The SMMT called last month for Britain to be kept in the single market and customs union until any new trade agreement with the EU is actually implemented, but he said the industry view is still that any new arrangement will be worse than being in the EU. \u201cFrom our point of view we would be better off to stay. If the electorate decide they maybe didn\u2019t understand the economic arguments or didn\u2019t appreciate how severe the impact was going to be and we need to revisit this, then we will make clear again what the situation is.\u201d"
"20||Thomasina Miers\u2019 recipe for baked bream with tomatoes and peppersWhen the weather is this good, the last thing I want to do is spend hours in the kitchen. There, I\u2019ve said it: it\u2019s the summer holidays, and I want to go on adventures with the children, sip wine with friends and visit beautiful gardens out of town. At this time of year, I basically just want to make-believe that every weekend is the holidays. And it\u2019s not just me: even my local market seems to be mimicking the Mediterranean with its stalls laden with apricots, berries, tomatoes and aubergines. As part of our 10th anniversary at Wahaca, we have been hosting all sorts of dinners and events, and I\u2019ve been talking about Mexico even more than usual: my mission to explain the true magic of that country\u2019s food continues. I often revert to talking about Italian food as a comparison, because it shares not only such strong similarities in terms of regionality and an intensely strong food culture, but also so many ingredients taken from Mexico. When the Spanish discovered the Americas, it was at a time when they were also rulers of Sicily, and the exchange of ingredients and ideas between the two countries led to many splendid dishes. Today\u2019s recipe is a case in point: it is inspired by Veracruz, one of Mexico\u2019s oldest and most important ports, where the food is very Mediterranean-like in feel. This dish is quick to throw together, and most of what work there is, is done for you while the tomatoes and peppers cook down gently into a silky heap. The capers and pickled chillies give it a lively touch of heat and a delicious edge of acidity. Perfect for a hazy, sun-soaked summer evening, in fact. Baked bream with peppers and tomatoes Serves four. 5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 2 large onions, peeled, cut in half and then into thin half-moons 1 small handful fresh thyme or oregano, leaves picked and roughly chopped 1 cinnamon stick 50g pickled jalape\u00f1o chillies (ie, about 3), roughly chopped 4 cloves garlic, peeled and cut into very thin slivers 3 tbsp small capers Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 6 peppers (3 red, 3 orange), cut in half, seeds and pith removed and discarded, flesh cut into small chunks 500g multicoloured cherry tomatoes 100ml rich, full-bodied white wine 1 handful fresh basil leaves 4 sustainably sourced bream fillets (ie, from 2 fish) Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Heat a large pan over a medium heat, then add four tablespoons of the oil. When the oil is hot, stir in the onions, herbs and cinnamon stick, and leave to sweat over a medium-low flame, stirring from time to time, until the onions turn soft and translucent \u2013 about 10 minutes. Add the chillies, garlic and capers to the pan, season generously and cook for five minutes more, then stir in the peppers, tomatoes and wine. Transfer the mix to a baking dish and roast for half an hour, by which time the sauce will be smelling inviting and the vegetables will be deliciously soft. Taste the vegetables and season accordingly (if your tomatoes are not sweet enough, it will help to add a pinch of brown sugar). Shred the basil and scatter on top, then lay the bream fillets on top of the vegetables. Drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, then roast for 10-15 minutes, until the fish is just cooked and still firm. Serve with a fresh, crisp green salad and some boiled new potatoes, rice or crusty bread to mop up the sauce. And for the rest of the week\u2026 The herby veg sauce is delicious as a foil for baked eggs, too: bake the vegetables for half an hour, then crack in some eggs and cook until done, and you\u2019ll have an excellent brunch to eat with tortillas. Or serve the veg cold as part of a meze with bread, cheese and salad. Leftover jalape\u00f1os last for weeks in the fridge and add a deliciously bright tingle of heat to all sorts: I like them chopped with capers on leeks vinaigrette, or in a quick egg mayonnaise roll."
"21||George Little obituaryGeorge Little, who has died aged 90, was a painter who chronicled the heavy industry of south Wales. His life\u2019s work documented the region\u2019s decline, the most recent paintings showing the ruins of once vibrant and mighty industries. George was born in Swansea and spent his childhood in Danygraig, a working-class area close to the city docks. He witnessed the bombing raids between 19 and 21 February 1941 that destroyed the centre of the city. Many years later, he made a series of paintings based on Swansea\u2019s \u201cthree-night blitz\u201d. George\u2019s father, Bert, was an engine driver on the railways; his mother, Alma, had been in service. Both were self-educated and cared greatly for the education of their two sons. George\u2019s first art training was at Swansea School of Art before he undertook national service in Germany with the RAF. He returned to the same school, took an art teaching qualification, and then, in 1951, won a bursary to study at the Ruskin School of Drawing in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, which was where I met him. As a student, as in later life as a teacher of painting and art history, George was remarkable for his optimism, enthusiasm, kindness and ability. We were lucky at the Ruskin to work in one of the world\u2019s great museums and, equally important, to be taught by the Ruskin master Percy Horton, a skilful draughtsman and teacher of great integrity. I first visited Wales with George in those years. He introduced me to the bright colours of ships in the docks, the sombre tones of the mining valleys, winding gear and heavy machines, and the drama and brilliant colour of copper smelting, iron foundries and steel production. His first art school teaching job was in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, and was followed by several years teaching at Swansea School of Art before he moved to teach in the University of Wales, Swansea. He was one of the founders of the university\u2019s Taliesin Gallery and art complex; and in 1999 he arranged a two-man exhibition for us there. We took the same show to the Beldam Gallery at Brunel University, London, the following year, and in 2001, shared an exhibition in Oxford, at Christ Church College Picture Gallery, titled The Industrial Image. George never courted the media or played with gimmicks to catch the public eye. He refined his art tenaciously, following a single inspiration while never ceasing to experiment with form or colour or materials. He was an inspiration to students and younger artists. In 1975 George married Carolyn Denny, one of his former students at Swansea; they had previously shared a studio and their continuing collaboration as artists was extremely successful. Their last work together was a large mural on the themes of coloured harbour buoys, now in a dockside cafe, the Swigg, in Swansea. Carolyn survives him, as do the two daughters, Charlotte and Rebecca, of his first marriage, which ended in divorce, and his five grandchildren."
"1||Brilliant Battaash on course for Nunthorpe battle with Lady AureliaIn mid June, Battaash went to post as a 12-1 chance for a Listed race at Sandown Park, just another promising three-year-old sprinter in a field that was full of them. Less than seven weeks later, he scorched down the five-furlong track here to take the Group Two King George Stakes, beating a Group One-winning sprinter with ease as he did so, and Battaash will now make the step up to the highest level himself in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York later this month. That race now promises to be one of the most eagerly anticipated sprint-race duels of recent seasons, as Wesley Ward\u2019s Lady Aurelia, the brilliant winner of the King\u2019s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, is also being steered towards the Knavesmire on 25 August. Lady Aurelia remains favourite for the Nunthorpe at a top price of 7-4 with Paddy Power, but Battaash is close behind at best odds of 3-1 with Stan James and as short as 2-1 elsewhere. Charlie Hills\u2019s gelding won here despite the soft ground, which he had not experienced before, and was visibly travelling more swiftly and easily than his rivals from an early stage. Jim Crowley sent him into the lead just over a furlong out and Battaash quickened two-and-a-quarter lengths clear of Profitable, the 2016 King\u2019s Stand winner, stopping the clock at 58.51sec, a lightning-fast time in the prevailing conditions. \u201cHe\u2019s a three-year-old who\u2019s improving and going through the ranks and this is another step up today,\u201d Hills said. \u201cHe\u2019s up against some proper sprinters there and he just travelled with such ease. \u201cThese were completely different conditions today than at Sandown [last time] and he broke the track record there, so it was a little bit of an unknown if he would handle the ground. \u201cFive furlongs at York should really suit him. He\u2019s got the American horse to contend with there as well, but that should make it a good race. It\u2019s the obvious race for him.\u201d Crowley said afterwards that he \u201ccould not believe how well I was going\u201d when he made his move towards the lead. \u201cI was just hoping on that ground that he\u2019d keep going,\u201d the jockey said. \u201cI never felt like I was in trouble at any stage, he just has so much natural speed. He can be a little bit hot, but the horse is growing up with every run and is a lot more relaxed now. He will probably be even better on better ground.\u201d Goodwood is one of the trickiest top-level tracks to ride and can catch out even the best jockeys at times, but Ryan Moore made it look easy in the first three races on the card as he completed a 52-1 treble on Poet\u2019s Word, Beat The Bank and then Master The World, who took the day\u2019s featured handicap, the Betfred Mile, with a bold run up the far rail Master The World had finished second in the same race last year off a 3lb lower mark, but responded well when a gap appeared inside the final furlong and then held off the late charge of Tony Curtis, whose path to the line was not quite so direct. \u201cHe has considerable ability,\u201d David Elsworth, the winner\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cHe is a Group Three class, or even Group Two horse, but when you get these handicaps with old professionals, they duck and dive and it is hard work out there. \u201cRyan is the man that you want in your corner. I feel sorry for Pat Dobbs, who rode him last year and would have ridden him today, but he is suspended so we had to make do with Ryan.\u201d Poet\u2019s Word, who took the Group Three Glorious Stakes over 12 furlongs, is entered in both the International Stakes at York later this month and the Irish Champion Stakes in September. \u201cI think he will be [Group One class], but they might come too soon,\u201d Moore said. \u201cSir Michael [Stoute] has been patient with him and I think he has the makings of a proper horse.

"7||Standing around frowning and patting the top of their heads a lotWE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE MENTIONED THE QUEEN\u2019S CELTIC DRAWING ASTANA, COME TO THINK ABOUT IT, BUT WE DIDN\u2019T The benefits of winning away at Burnley, or at home against Crystal Palace, or not letting in three goals against Swansea City were writ large today, as Liverpool were handed a tricky draw in the 893rd and final qualifying round for Big Cup. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side, who would have gained automatic qualification to the group stage had they won at Hull last season, or managed to hold on to a 3-1 lead with 14 minutes to play against a club which nearly got relegated from the Football League only seven years earlier, will face Hoffenheim. Actually, putting in a shift at struggling Leicester, or scoring a couple against Southampton here and there could have avoided all this nonsense as well. Turn- und Sportgemeinschaft 1899 Hoffenheim e.V. are not a big name, granted, having won the grand total of zero major trophies since their formation 118 years ago. But they were fourth best in the Bundesliga last season, which means they\u2019re in much better nick than more successful institutions such as Hamburg, Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Schalke, Werder Bremen, Eintracht Frankfurt, Eintracht Braunschweig, Rot-Weiss Essen and SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth. Kerem Dermirbay is a creative and dangerous playmaker, Andrej Kramaric knows where the net is, and only Bayern Munich conceded fewer goals in Germany last season. That\u2019s bad news for Liverpool, who upon being faced with a team happy to sit back and soak up pressure, tend to grind to a halt and stand around frowning and patting the top of their heads with the flat of their palms quite a lot. Klopp has developed a useful habit of annoying his fellow countrymen since arriving at Liverpool, having put Augsburg and former club Borussia Dortmund to the sword in Big Vase last year, and embarrassed a Bayern Munich side who weren\u2019t really trying very hard in a pre-season friendly earlier this week. But all good runs come to an end at some point. Should the worst happen against Hoffenheim, it\u2019ll be a Thursday-night Big Vase campaign for Liverpool, and a serious downer on their season with it barely begun. Then again, that would open up the possibility further down the line of a continental showdown with Everton, who drew Hajduk Split in the Big Vase play-offs today. A long way to go before that could happen, of course, but your neutral Tranmere-favouring Fiver isn\u2019t making any social commitments next March, just in case.

"6||This anti-abortion hijacking of Black Lives Matter is cynical and offensiveIt\u2019s a fairly large number, 100,000, but nice and round. Easy to compute. Most of us could even divide it by 10, at a push. Apparently it is this convenient roundedness that led the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) this week to dismiss complaints about recent claims on a billboard that Northern Ireland\u2019s abortion laws have saved \u201c100,000\u201d lives. In its statement, the ASA said: \u201cWe considered that 100,000 was a large, round number that readers would typically associate with estimates\u201d \u2013 and was therefore unproblematic. Funded by a campaign called Both Lives Matter, the billboard prompted 14 complaints, but the ASA decided that its assertion was not misleading \u2013 despite the campaign admitting that it is not possible to calculate an exact figure, although its estimate is both \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d. It is not just the advertisement that is misleading and offensive, but also the very name of the campaign behind the billboard. Describing itself as \u201cpro-women and pro-life\u201d, Both Lives Matter is a recent addition to the Northern Ireland anti-choice landscape, where abortion is permitted only if a woman\u2019s life is at risk or there is a very serious risk to her mental or physical health. Fatal foetal abnormalities and pregnancies resulting from sexual crime such as rape or incest are not included. And yet, somehow, in all its talk of \u201cboth\u201d lives mattering during a crisis pregnancy, the campaign fails ever to mention the pregnant woman. What is happening to that person\u2019s life \u2013 their body, their dreams, their finances, their mental health \u2013 is, for a campaign seemingly more intent on oppressing women than liberating them, nothing more than a word association game meant to draw a provocative parallel with a real struggle for civil rights. Playing on Black Lives Matter is not just cynical, it\u2019s offensive. A campaign started by three black women \u2013 Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi \u2013 to highlight the gross injustice and racial dimensions of police brutality in the US, it owes much of its strength not only to the mothers of the men and women killed by police, but to women of colour writ large, who bear the brunt of America\u2019s institutionalised racism and sexism. The concept of reproductive rights and reproductive justice, which goes far beyond the simple right to choose whether or not to continue with a pregnancy, is integral to Black Lives Matter, because it also means the right to parent your child in a safe environment without fear \u2013 something consistently denied to black families by police and institutional injustice. Defined by the Sister Song Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective as \u201cthe human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities,\u201d reproductive justice as a concept was developed by women of colour who saw many of their communities challenged not just by an absence of accessible abortion, but by poverty, racism and discrimination. It is often poor women of colour whose access to reproductive healthcare is most affected by anti-abortion laws in states such as Texas, where the recent HB2 law increased the distance to the nearest abortion clinic by more than 100 miles in some places. This can be an insurmountable burden for women with low incomes, often women of colour, and is a pattern being repeated across America. Concepts such as reproductive justice and campaigns such as Black Lives Matter are a response to oppression and domination. There are parallels to be drawn with abortion access in Northern Ireland, but it is not the one that anti-abortion protesters attempt to make. Rather, it is an understanding of how human rights might be used to liberate communities, rather than excuse and justify their oppression. The hijacking of such a powerful concept by the Both Lives Matter campaign is a cynical attempt to spin the language of human rights into froth to hide their true agenda \u2013 the subjugation of women. An appropriation of intersecting oppressions, Both Lives Matter neither cares about women\u2019s lives, nor shares an affinity with Black Lives Matter \u2013 beyond using a powerful rallying cry for human rights as a cover to maintain the marginalisation of women in Northern Ireland. It is perhaps beyond the remit of the ASA to name this for what it is. But it is not beyond ours. \u2022 Elizabeth Nelson is an activist with the Belfast Feminist Network"

This seaside town still seems wedged in the age of Charles Hawtrey and the three-day week. All the more surprising with just a few hundred yards on one side dividing it from Whitstable, which seems to sprout a biodynamic toddlerwear emporium every third day, and a few miles on the other keeping Margate and its slam-poetry cafes at bay.

"8||Extreme heat warnings issued in Europe as temperatures pass 40CEleven southern and central European countries have issued extreme heat warnings amid a brutal heatwave nicknamed Lucifer, with residents and tourists urged to take precautions and scientists warning worse could be still to come. Authorities in countries including Italy, Switzerland, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia are on red alert, the European forecasters\u2019 network Meteoalarm said, and swaths of southern Spain and France are on amber. As temperatures in many places hit or exceeded 40C (104F) in the region\u2019s most sustained heatwave since 2003, emergency services are being put on standby and people have been asked to \u201cremain vigilant\u201d, stay indoors, avoid long journeys, drink enough fluids and listen for emergency advice from health officials. At least two people have died from the heat, one in Romania and one in Poland, and many more taken to hospital suffering from sunstroke and other heat-related conditions. Italy said its hospitalisation rate was 15% above normal and asked people in affected regions only to travel if their journey was essential. Polish officials warned of possible infrastructure failures. A spokeswoman for Abta, the UK travel trade organisation, reinforced the advice for holidaymakers, saying they should take sensible precautions, keep hydrated by drinking plenty of water, stay out of the sun in the middle of the day, and follow any advice issued by health authorities in specific destinations. The heatwave, now in its fourth day and expected to last until next Wednesday, follows an earlier spell of extreme temperatures last month that fuelled a spate of major wildfires, exacerbated droughts in Italy and Spain, and damaged crops. The highest temperature on Thursday was 42C in Cordoba, Spain, and Catania, Italy. Split in Croatia also hit 42.3C on Wednesday. The spell is forecast to peak at the weekend with temperatures of 46C or higher in Italy and parts of the Balkans. Authorities in Italy, which is suffering its worst drought in 60 years, have placed 26 cities on the maximum extreme heat alert, including Venice and Rome. Many of Rome\u2019s fountains have been turned off, and last week the city only narrowly averted drastic water rationing. In Florence, the Uffizi art gallery was temporarily closed on Friday when the air-conditioning system broke down. In Hungary, keepers at Budapest zoo cooled down two overheating polar bears with huge ice blocks. Temperatures along parts of Croatia\u2019s Adriatic coast, including Dubrovnik, were expected to hit 42C during the day. In the Serbian capital of Belgrade there were reports of people fainting from heat exhaustion. Highs in Spain, including in popular holiday resorts on the Costa del Sol and on the island of Majorca, are set to reach 43C this weekend, with extreme conditions also forecast in Seville, Malaga and Granada. Ibiza and Mallorca could hit 42C, Spain\u2019s Aemet meteorological service warned. While Europe\u2019s record high is 48C, set in Athens in 1977, current temperatures are in many places as much as 10-15C higher than normal for the time of year and likely to result in more fatalities, experts have said. Europe\u2019s record-breaking 2003 heatwave resulted in more than 20,000 heat-related deaths, mainly of old and vulnerable people, including 15,000 in France, where temporary mortuaries were set up in refrigerated lorries. Such spells of extreme heat in southern Europe could be a foretaste of things to come. French researchers last month predicted summer conditions in some of the continent\u2019s popular tourist destinations could become significantly tougher. Writing in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the scientists said if a similar \u201cmega-heatwave\u201d to that of 2003 were to occur at the end of the century, when average temperatures are widely expected to be noticeably higher after decades of global warming, temperatures could pass 50C. The researchers noted that climate models suggest \u201chuman influence is expected to significantly increase the frequency, duration and intensity of heatwaves in Europe\u201d and said their modelling suggested that by 2100, peak summer temperatures could rise by between 6C and 13C against historical records. The village of Conqueyrac in the Gard department of France hit 44.1C on two occasions in the summer of 2003, the highest temperature ever recorded in the country, meaning \u201cthe record maximum value could easily exceed 50C by the end of the 21st century\u201d, the scientists concluded. The current extreme temperatures, coupled with strong winds, have fanned wildfires that have already caused more than 60 deaths this summer in Portugal and caused widespread damage in southern France, Greece and Italy. About 300 firefighters and military personnel were fighting 75 wildfires on Friday in Albania, with firefighters also busy in Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Croatia, Greece and the French island of Corsica. In Italy, fires killed a 79-year-old woman in the central Abruzzo region and forced the closure of the main Via Aurelia coastal motorway that runs northwards from Rome to the Italian Riviera. The country\u2019s winemakers have started harvesting their grapes weeks earlier than usual due to the heat. The founder of the Slow Food movement, Carlo Petrini, said no harvest in living memory had begun before 15 August. The heatwave is likely to cost Italy\u2019s agricultural sector billions of euros, with as many as 11 regions facing critical water shortages. Olive yields in some areas are forecast to be down 50% and some milk production has fallen by up to 30%. Bosnian officials said the heatwave and drought had nearly halved agricultural output, which represents 10% of the country\u2019s economic output, and Serbia said its corn production could be cut a third."
"8||Flight delays and cancellations: your rights explainedBritish passengers flying to and from continental Europe over the coming weeks have been warned about possible long delays at airports. Many flights have been delayed because of the tighter border checks. And at Barcelona airport, security staff have begun a series of rolling strikes. For some holidaymakers the long queues are a massive inconvenience \u2013 aggravated by sweltering conditions at some airports \u2013 but for others it\u2019s much worse than that, as it means they are missing flights and connections. So where do they stand and what can they do? Am I entitled to compensation if I miss my flight because of a huge queue? Probably not. Alex Neill at Which? says: \u201cPassengers who miss a flight due to security queues are unlikely to qualify for compensation from their airline, as the time it takes to get through security is out of the airline\u2019s control.\u201d However, if a consumer has booked a package holiday that includes airport transfers and misses their flight owing to queues at security, the package provider is responsible for arranging another flight because of obligations under the Package Travel Regulations. Independent travellers arguably have fewer rights. So what should people do? Passengers should allow a lot of extra time for getting through security etc. The advice from some airlines is to arrive at the airport at least three hours before departure. Some are texting customers in advance if they are heading to an airport where there are known problems. British Airways says it depends on the issue and the airport, but if there are long delays at a location, it may hold the flight so delayed passengers are able to board. \u201cIf it\u2019s quite clear there are massive queues and we are missing 20, 30, 40 people, we might wait a bit,\u201d a spokesman said. BA added that it may allow someone who misses their flight because of the queues to rebook on to a later flight for free. And there may be some circumstances in which those affected can claim compensation \u2013 for example, if their flight is delayed due to the knock-on effects of the security delays, said Which? Passengers have rights under EU law to claim compensation for delayed or cancelled flights, for services that departed within the EU or were operated by a European airline. Delays of more than three hours for short-haul flights (up to 1,500 km or 930 miles) attract compensation of \u20ac250, while the figure is \u20ac400 for medium-haul trips (1,500 km to 3,500 km). For long-haul flights (more than 3,500 km), delays of between three and four hours have compensation set at \u20ac300, and for delays of longer than four hours the figure is \u20ac600. Airlines are required to give passengers food and drinks for delays of more than two hours, as well as hotel accommodation for overnight delays. Yes, what about water \u2013 shouldn\u2019t they be giving it out for free? Some commentators claim that in recent years UK airports have been gradually removing free water fountains, forcing travellers to buy expensive bottled water instead. Moneysavingexpert.com said this week that it had contacted 30 UK airports that offer international flights to ask them if passengers could fill up an empty bottle for free at a water fountain after security. While many of the bigger airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester and Stansted, do have fountains (if you can find them), 18 said they did not. If you\u2019re queuing in 40C heat at an overseas airport, that is clearly pretty grim. Some travellers with children say they send their offspring into airport restaurants, cafes etc, armed with a water bottle, in the hope that a pleading young face will result in staff taking pity and filling their container for free. These delays sound like a nightmare \u2013 do I have any other options? Those people about to head to the south of France by Eurostar are probably feeling very smug \u2013 though Eurostar, of course, is not immune to delays, technical foul-ups etc. The company operates direct trains to Lyon, Avignon and Marseille, plus a service to Bordeaux (the latter involves a change of trains). If you are planning a last-minute break, a quick Guardian price check on Friday morning found there were still some not horrifically expensive fares available for August and early September. We found return Eurostar fares from London St Pancras to Marseille from \u00a3109 per person."

He contracted polio during infancy, and was in a wheelchair for most of his life. Yet he attended countless demonstrations, for CND, housing and disability rights, and was arrested more than once. Keith\u2019s father, John Armstrong, was a South African who had come to Britain to volunteer for the Royal Navy during the second world war, where he met Frances (nee Waddilove), known as Nina, who was serving as a Wren. They married and moved to Cape Town after the war. Nina was pregnant with Keith when his father was killed in a car accident in 1950. When Keith contracted polio, Nina returned to the UK for his treatment. He attended Hephaistos school for boys with disabilities, near Reading. At 16, he launched his own poetry magazine, the Informer. I met him around this time on a CND march, when I was five years old, through his friendship with my father. In the early 1970s, Keith acquired a council flat in Euston, north London. Hundreds of activists passed through the flat, many of them working as his helpers, and he influenced all of them. He was involved in the campaign for accessible transport of the 80s and 90s, during which he was arrested with six others for blocking New Oxford Street. The case was thrown out of court as the courthouse did not then have ramp access for defendants using wheelchairs. Despite a strong distrust of government, he became an adviser to several London boroughs, including Ealing and Camden, serving on the management committee of the latter\u2019s Dial-a-Ride scheme during the 1980s, also its chair (1984-86), and to London Transport. In 1986 he was a consultant to the Greater London council on its disability awareness handbook, and in 1994 he went on a mission to research public transport accessibility in the US. He continued protesting throughout the 1990s and 2000s with the Disabled People\u2019s Direct Action Network (DAN), whose campaigning led to ramps in buses and improvements to tube and train access, as well as the introduction of the Disability Discrimination Act in 1995. Keith had a particular interest in the Roman emperor Claudius, publishing his writings at academia.edu. His work as a concrete poet and typewriter artist is included in Typewriter Art: A Modern Anthology (2014) and The Art of Typewriting (2015); and his music can be heard on SoundCloud, under the name \u201cruhuman\u201d. Keith did not suffer fools gladly. But he enjoyed a laugh, often at his own expense, and was unfailingly kind and generous to anyone who needed help. He saved many from homelessness by letting them stay at his flat for days, months or even years. He is survived by his brother, Christopher, and his sister, Angela."
"8||Israeli police confirm Netanyahu is suspect in fraud investigationIsrael\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been named as a suspect in two investigations into allegations of \u201cfraud, breach of trust and bribes\u201d with his former chief of staff signing a deal with prosecutors to testify against him. The moves mark the most serious political crisis for the Israeli leader, the only prime minister to rival founding father David Ben-Gurion for longevity in office. The suspicions against Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing, were first revealed in a court application by detectives on Thursday seeking a gag order on reporting details of negotiations with Ari Harow, the former chief of staff, to become a state witness. Talks were concluded on Friday with Harow signing a deal in which he agreed to testify. According to a statement from the Israel Police, Harow is expected to receive six months of community service and a fine of $193,000 on separate breach of trust charges \u2013 rather than a prison sentence \u2013 in exchange for his testimony. The latest dramatic twists in the series of long-running investigations into Netanyahu, his family and close circle, have led some commentators in the Israeli media to suggest that an indictment may now be inevitable. Amid mounting calls from politicians for Netanyahu to stand down if he is charged in any of the investigations, commentators even in media usually friendly to the Israeli prime minister \u2013 including the rightwing Jerusalem Post \u2013 have begun beginning to talk about \u2018alternatives\u2019 to him. The confirmation of the seriousness of the allegations comes on the day after his wife, Sara, was again interviewed by police in a separate case relating to claims for household costs in the prime minister\u2019s residence. The saga \u2013 which at times has played out like a soap opera \u2013 has gripped Israelis as it touched on many of the criticisms of Netanyahu during his long political career, including his sense of persecution, his insatiable wheeler-dealing to stay in power, his taste for luxury and sense of entitlement. For his part, Netanyahu and his office have dismissed the accusations against him as a politically motivated witch-hunt designed to push him out of office. It has also lifted the lid on the cosy and often nepotistic relationship between Israel\u2019s business and political elite in a country where many Israelis struggle with a high cost of living and modest salaries. While the scope of the investigations in the so-called cases 1000 and 2000 \u2013 the first about gifts from wealthy benefactors and the second over attempts to sway media coverage \u2013 have long been known, it is the first time Netanyahu has been publicly designated as a suspect. Netanyahu\u2019s office denied the accusations and said investigators were trying to bring down his government. \u201cWe completely reject the unfounded claims made against the prime minister. The campaign to change the government is under way, but it is destined to fail, for a simple reason: there won\u2019t be anything because there was nothing,\u201d a statement said. It comes as a third high-profile corruption investigation \u2013 case 3000 \u2013 has focused on allegations of bribery within his inner circle over a deal to buy submarines from Germany. The application for the gag order, made to the Rishon Lezion magistrate\u2019s court in central Israel, followed the confirmation by Israel\u2019s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, earlier on Thursday that talks were under way with Harow, a close confidant of Netanyahu, to testify in exchange for leniency. Harow served as Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff for two years from 2008, when the politician was in opposition. He returned in 2014 to serve as the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, but resigned a year later amid allegations of corruption, which he denied. Harow was accused of having used his ties to Netanyahu to advance his private interests. Police have recommended he be indicted for bribery and breach of trust, but Mandelblit has yet to file formal charges against him. The gag order also affects case 1000, in which the prime minister and his wife are suspected of receiving illicit gifts from billionaire benefactors \u2013 most notably expensive cigars and champagne from the Israeli-born Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan. Netanyahu is the primary suspect in the case. The couple has denied any wrongdoing. The investigations have begun to have an impact on Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing Likud party, whose senior figures are sparring publicly over whether their leader can remain in office if he is indicted. Likud officials have sharply criticised any suggestions Netanyahu may have to step down. \u201cThe prime minister does not need to resign, rather he needs to prove his innocence,\u201d said Likud\u2019s coalition chairman, David Bitan. \u201cThere will be no indictment. But let\u2019s say there will be: the charges would still be minor and the prime minister would be able both to function and to prove his innocence.\u201d Bitan has urged Likud supporters to rally in support of Netanyahu to counter weekly demonstrations against the slow progress of the investigation. Bitan said a rally on Saturday was designed \u201cto protest the invalid and anti-democratic attempt by those on the left who want to topple the government in a an undemocratic fashion\u201d."
"14||South Yorkshire police helicopter crew cleared over filming people nakedTwo police officers and two pilots accused of misusing a police helicopter to film naked sunbathers and a couple having sex have been cleared of all charges. The South Yorkshire police crew were accused of \u201ca gross waste of valuable resources\u201d by using the aircraft to make illicit recordings. A woman was filmed sunbathing naked with her daughters, aged 18 and 15, who were wearing bikinis, in her garden and a couple were filmed having sexual intercourse on the patio of their suburban house. Matthew Lucas, 42, and Lee Walls, 47, who are serving South Yorkshire police officers, Malcolm Reeves, 64, a retired pilot, and Matthew Loosemore, 45, a former pilot with the force, were charged with misconduct in a public office. But they blamed Adrian Pogmore, 51, formerly of South Yorkshire police, who shot the footage and was the only person in the aircraft when all four of the offending videos were filmed. Pogmore, from Whiston in Rotherham, was described by prosecutors as \u201ca swinging and sex-obsessed air observer\u201d. He had previously admitted four charges of misconduct in a public office. He was not in court for the trial. The other men said they did not know what Pogmore was doing as he filmed the sequences using the helicopter\u2019s high-powered camera. A jury of six men and six women at Sheffield crown court accepted their explanation, clearing them of the charges. The jury had been shown footage shot from the aircraft, including an 11-minute sequence of a couple having sex on their patio in a range of positions. In the footage the man is wearing only a Manchester United shirt and at one point the woman waves at the helicopter. Pogmore knew the couple through his interest in swinging. The court heard that he had previously had sex with the woman in the footage. He has already been sacked by South Yorkshire police and will be sentenced on Tuesday. Richard Wright QC, prosecuting, said: \u201cYou may hope that the police helicopter is chasing down criminals and keeping the community safe. You may never imagine that in fact it is being used to film a pair of swingers in the throes of sexual passion.\u201d Footage of naturists on a campsite was also shown to the jury, as well as another recording of people sunbathing naked. The woman who was filmed sunbathing nude with her daughters in her garden felt \u201csick\u201d at the thought of being recorded, which was \u201ca complete and utter violation\u201d of her privacy, the court heard. Some of the defendants appeared to be in tears after the jury foreman returned the verdicts after four hours of deliberation. Their families in the public gallery overlooking the court hugged each other and cried. As Lucas left the courtroom he said \u201cthank you\u201d to the jury. The prosecution stemmed from recordings found in Pogmore\u2019s desk drawer at a police station in 2015."
"22||Saudi ties raise doubts about Independent's editorial freedomA Saudi businessman who has bought a 30% stake in the Independent appears to have links to the country\u2019s government, raising questions about whether the deal could affect the news site\u2019s editorial independence. The Guardian understands that Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel works for NCB Capital, the investment banking arm of the National Commercial Bank, which is controlled by the Saudi government and is one of the biggest banks in the Middle East. In a move that highlights the concerns about the deal, Abuljadayel is understood to have had to sign a declaration that his investment is personal and that he is the ultimate beneficial owner of the Independent shares. News of Abuljadayel\u2019s stake emerged last week, sparking concerns that the website\u2019s liberal political stance and hard-hitting coverage of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record and foreign policy could change. Saudi Arabia\u2019s suppression of freedom of speech has been heavily criticised. It is one of several Middle Eastern countries that has demanded the closure of the broadcaster al-Jazeera in return for lifting a blockade of Qatar. Little was known about Abuljadayel when his investment in the Independent was revealed. Companies House filings say he is 42, based in Saudi Arabia, and appears to have no other UK business interests. He bought his shares from multiple investors. The deal means the shareholding of Evgeny Lebedev, the owner of the Independent\u2019s parent company, ESI Media, has fallen to 41%. Justin Byam Shaw, an entrepreneur and chairman of ESI, owns 26%, and the rest is held by smaller investors. It has been reported that Abuljadayel inherited his wealth and is from a family with international property investments. The Guardian has seen information showing that Abuljadayel is a manager at NCB Capital. ESI declined to comment on Abuljadayel\u2019s role at NCB Capital and Lebedev said he was not concerned about the possibility of editorial interference. While some journalists at the Independent have expressed unease about the Saudi\u2019s investment, others say they are confident that editorial independence will not be compromised. \u201cWe want to compete by breaking good stories from anywhere in the world. I don\u2019t see that changing,\u201d one source told the Guardian. Abuljadayel has not been given a seat on the board and a new agreement between the shareholders is designed to guarantee the editorial independence of the publication. Lebedev said: \u201cI am not remotely concerned about the prospect of editorial interference by a minority shareholder or anyone else. \u201cWe have recently formalised the editorial independence of the Independent in our shareholders\u2019 agreement and I think you will agree that our coverage of the Middle East continues to be as good and as independent as any UK news outlet and more robust than most.\u201d Lebedev announced in February 2016 that the Independent and Independent on Sunday would cease printing newspapers and continue online only. He told staff the move \u201cpreserves the Independent brand and allows us to continue to invest in the high quality editorial content that is attracting more and more readers to our online platforms\u201d. Since then, the Independent has reported a surge in online traffic in both the UK and US and it now has about 100 million unique users a month. The latest financial results for Independent Digital News and Media show it recorded a \u00a31.7m pre-tax profit in the year to 2 October 2016, up from \u00a31.3m the previous year. Revenue almost doubled from \u00a38.2m to \u00a314.3m. The Independent\u2019s digital operation employed an average of 49 people last year and ran up a wage bill of \u00a35.5m, including directors. Abuljadayel did not respond to requests for comment."
"14||Rashan Charles's family air their concerns about 'openness and fairness'The family of Rashan Charles, the young black man who died after a police chase in London, have told the police watchdog they are concerned about its \u201copenness and transparency\u201d. After confirmation from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) that an object removed from Charles\u2019s throat was a mixture of paracetamol and caffeine, the family have put out a statement asking that the composition of the object not be allowed to detract from their primary concerns. The 20-year-old\u2019s death in east London two weeks ago has sparked protests and violent clashes with police. His family said their \u201csingle objective\u201d was to find out what happened to him \u201cusing all lawful means available\u201d. The IPCC has said the evidence it has seen so far suggests Charles was detained by a Metropolitan police officer who had followed him on foot into a shop in Kingsland Road, east London, after a chase with police on 22 July. Video of the incident appeared to show him swallowing a package, leading to speculation that it contained illegal drugs, but tests have shown it did not. The officer restrained Charles with the help of a member of the public and he was handcuffed. After he was detained, attempts were made to remove the object from his mouth or throat. But Charles\u2019s condition deteriorated and the officer called for a police medic, who provided assistance prior to the arrival of paramedics, according to the IPCC. The watchdog said it had taken the decision to release information, including that the object removed from his throat was made up of a mixture of paracetamol and caffeine wrapped in plastic, \u201cgiven the inflammatory nature of some ongoing speculation\u201d. Charles\u2019s family urged the IPCC to carry out its investigation to the \u201chighest possible standards\u201d. The statement, released through Bhatt Murphy solicitors on Friday, said: \u201cWe are a large family and speak with one voice. \u201cOur single objective is to establish what happened to Rashan, and to do this using all lawful means available. \u201cWe expect the IPCC to conduct an investigation to the highest possible standards, and to provide the answers we urgently seek. We have raised concerns with the IPCC about openness and transparency, which is regrettable at this early stage. \u201cWe are aware, too, of the results on the forensic analysis conducted on the package recovered at the scene. \u201cWhilst this is important, we wish to make clear that the content of the package must not detract from our primary concern, which is to investigate the conduct of those involved in the incident that led to Rashan\u2019s death.\u201d The IPCC said no cause of death had yet been confirmed. Investigators will consider whether Charles\u2019s death was caused by the plastic wrapping rather than the contents. The inquiry will also examine the restraint used by police and whether that played a part in the cause of death, as well as what technique of restraint was used and whether it was authorised. According to Inquest, the charity that has been working with the family since his death, Charles is one of four black men who have died after police contact in just over six weeks in England. Last Friday, protests over the death led to some violent scenes in Hackney, east London, and the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, has warned of growing disquiet over the case. Charles\u2019s death and the resulting reaction has echoes of the death of Mark Duggan, who was shot by officers in 2011 in Tottenham, north London, leading to riots. On Friday, the sixth anniversary of Duggan\u2019s controversial death will be marked by a vigil and protest outside a police station in Tottenham."
"8||Barcelona airport strikes cause severe delaysHolidaymakers have been waiting in queues hundreds of metres long at Barcelona airport after security staff began a series of rolling strikes. The staff are protesting against low pay and poor working conditions in a series of staggered, hour-long strikes every Friday, Sunday and Monday until 14 August, when a 24-hour walkout is planned if the dispute is not resolved. On Friday there were strikes between 5.30am and 6.30am, and 10.30am and 11.30am. Travellers, mostly Spanish people setting off on their holidays, faced waits of up to three hours by late afternoon local time in queues that wound through the entire departure lounge in Terminal 1 and over two floors in Terminal 2. \u201cWe arrived at T2 at 4.30am for a 6.30am flight and it really looked like we weren\u2019t going to make it,\u201d said Oscar Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cBut then at the last moment they opened a couple more checkpoints and we got through in time.\u201d Many travellers appeared to be forewarned and arrived with time to spare, or so they hoped. \u201cWe knew about it so we came early,\u201d said Jan Surill, 45, a Dutch businessman travelling to the US with his family. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited an hour and I hope we\u2019ll get through on time. But it\u2019s a strike, so what can you do?\u201d Airport authorities set up a \u201cfast track\u201d gate for people travelling with small children, but the service was not publicised so most families continued to queue with everyone else. Last week more than 1,000 people missed their flights out of Barcelona as a result of the industrial action. Those affected could try to claim compensation from the Spanish airport authority, Aena. Generally, airlines will not accept responsibility for missed flights caused by airport delays. El Prat airport is Spain\u2019s second busiest after Madrid. Passenger traffic rose by more than 60% from 2009-16, driven by the arrival of low-cost flights to the tourist destination. The airport processed 44 million passengers last year, with 200,000 people passing through each day during peak season. An emergency meeting at 9am between the strike committee and Eulen, the security contractor, failed to reach an agreement, although both sides claimed it \u201chad gone well\u201d. The regional Catalan government was expected to convene a meeting later in the day. Barcelona\u2019s airport, like others in Europe, was also affected by delays in police passport controls after new EU regulations were introduced several weeks ago. Aena awarded Eulen a \u20ac23m (\u00a321m), two-year contract to run security at El Prat. The authority was wholly state-owned until February 2015 when 49% was floated on the stock exchange. Unions say standards have fallen as the company tries to increase shareholder value. \u201cBefore privatisation, Aena was a profitable public company and a model of good management,\u201d a spokesman for the Comisiones Obreras union said. Shares in the company had risen by 130% in the two years since the flotation. Security staff say that understaffing and a basic monthly salary of \u20ac900-\u20ac1,100 (\u00a3812\u2013\u00a3990) forces them to work overtime. Aena has threatened Eulen with a \u20ac300,000 fine if it doesn\u2019t improve its service, which it says is \u201ccausing grave damage to the airport\u2019s image\u201d. Eulen claims it invested an extra \u20ac450,000 at El Prat in early July, but the extra money failed to resolve the conflict. Marti Serrate, the president of Spain\u2019s travel agency association Acave, urged people to go to the airport at least four hours early."
"6||Just about managing? For these Tory failures, life is sweetIt feels fitting that Nick Timothy\u2019s big pitch was to the \u201cjust about managing\u201d. I am just about managing not to shriek with laughter at news that Theresa May\u2019s recently departed chief of staff is back already, to write a weekly column in the Daily Telegraph and a monthly one in the Sun. I know! What month? February 2035? I think there\u2019s an outside chance I could tolerate hearing from Nick by then. By all accounts, he has a massive brain, and it\u2019s always slightly awkward to have to explain highly complex political ideas to someone who thinks they wrote the book on them. But here goes. The technical term for what he, fellow henchperson Fiona Hill and prime minister Theresa May did with the last election, at this most crucial, time-pressured moment in Britain\u2019s national journey, is \u201cshit the bed\u201d. In any of the more decent decades of the past 100 years \u2013 basically all of them \u2013 Nick Timothy would be regarded as marginally more toxic than that salmonella outbreak at that e-waste processing site in Ghana, which itself makes Chernobyl look like a Dettol ad. And yet he has waltzed straight back to two high-profile and presumably highly paid media gigs. Some of you will have had package holidays longer than Nick\u2019s period in the political desert. I hope he used the time to write a searing account of the experience, perhaps titled Long Way Back, or The Wilderness Minutes. We\u2019re reportedly due a big interview with him in Saturday\u2019s Telegraph, so maybe he\u2019ll acknowledge this. Or perhaps he\u2019ll simply reprise his earlier take on the abortive election: \u201cWhile I accept that the manifesto might have been too ambitious\u201d \u2013 if anything, he\u2019s too committed \u2013 \u201cI worry that the implication of this argument is that politicians should not be straight with the electorate.\u201d Righto. And yet, I worry that the implication of Nick\u2019s insta-rehabilitation is that the electorate cannot be straight with politicians (elected or otherwise). The electorate was pretty straight with Nick: he pushed to call the election when the Tories were 21 points ahead in the polls; by the time May and team had worked their magic they\u2019d lost their majority. I mean \u2026 the collective message to Nick was not what you might term opaque. And yet he appears to have decided that the public was really asking for more, and soon. That said, his isn\u2019t the only splashy bit of career news this week. Many will have enjoyed the spectacle of Samantha Cameron inviting Harpers Bazaar into her Oxfordshire house in order to promote her fashion business. Hard to pick a lowlight, though perhaps you\u2019d go for the bit where David Cameron\u2019s wife explains she bought two dresses for the referendum \u2013 one for if they won, and one for if they lost. In the end, Samantha wore her win dress after all. Reading this, I kept waiting for a punchline. It turned out to literally be an anecdote about which \u00a31,500 dress she ended up wearing for her husband\u2019s prime ministerial farewell to the country he\u2019d just, on his own measure of success, fucked. See also Sam\u2019s description of the house as \u201cslightly falling down\u201d. Does anyone \u2013 particularly someone who, during the week, lives in the very shadow of Grenfell Tower \u2013 currently want to get into some hideously affected public riff on the maintenance of their \u00a31.5m-plus second hovel? I rather think they don\u2019t, but then I\u2019m not in fashion. Flicking on through the photos, there was, naturally, another run-out for David Cameron\u2019s ghastly \u00a325,000 \u201cshepherd\u2019s hut\u201d, which I increasingly feel must be a deliberate nod to Marie Antoinette\u2019s hameau. The hameau was very much the Versailles version of a shepherd\u2019s hut \u2013 indeed, the Queen used to dress up as a shepherdess and play at tending her dyed and perfumed flock, before these kind of activities were misunderstood by the peasants. Cameron writes speeches in his hameau, and then jets off to five-star hotels to deliver them for a hundred grand or so per throw. The other week, you\u2019ll recall, he was in Seoul, explaining that critics of austerity were \u201cselfish\u201d. Next year at Davos, I hope he simply herds a flock of pink sheep on stage and inquires: \u201cAnyone fancy skiing to Klosters for lunch?\u201d As for his closest political buddy, former chancellor George Osborne famously passed straight through the revolving door into the editor\u2019s chair at the London Evening Standard, and now has all sorts of people \u201cthinking again\u201d about him on account of his amusingly frequent editorial attacks on Theresa May, the PM who sacked him. And yet, looked at another way, Osborne is a guy who couldn\u2019t take the rejection of being professionally broken up with, despite his clearly unreasonable behaviour, and who now spends his days tormenting the one who spurned him. He\u2019s a sort of political stalker, really. Much more seriously, the effects of his ultra-ideological pursuit of austerity can be seen in a devastating denunciation this week by Britain\u2019s most senior family judge. Of a case involving a 17-year-old girl that cuts to the heart of catastrophic underfunding of child mental health services, James Munby said: \u201cwe, the system, society, the state \u2026 will have blood on our hands\u201d. Anyone \u201cthinking again\u201d about Osborne is advised to think again about doing so. Meanwhile, I await the Evening Standard report on the case with interest. Instead, Osborne seems to be spending much of his time \u201csettling scores\u201d with May, while some are speculating that Nick Timothy will use his own media pulpits to \u201csettle scores\u201d with Philip Hammond, and his many other enemies. Let\u2019s hope not. Public life today seems to be run as a host of bitter personal revenge plots, by characters who reinvent themselves so quickly it feels like we\u2019re watching one endless continuity error. And yet the country is shackled to this wildly dysfunctional telenovela, even in its hour of destiny. No point wondering where these people get off, because they clearly don\u2019t. But it does seem worth wondering how long so-called Jams are going to just about manage to stomach the spectacle. They must subsist precariously, while people who fail big in political life \u2013 often making things even more precarious for those who can ill afford it \u2013 simply reboard the gravy train and pootle off to the next stop. Or as the framed poster by the sink in David Cameron\u2019s second home (thanks, Harpers Bazaar!) prefers to put it: \u201cCalm down, dear \u2013 it\u2019s only a recession.\u201d \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"
"15||How do you feel about assisted dying? Share your thoughts with usLegalising euthanasia is seen by many as a way of enabling people to choose a humane and dignified death, and to die in their own homes with friends and family. Despite the defeat of the assisted dying bill in the UK, support seems to be growing. In the US, Colorado became the sixth state to allow what advocates for death with dignity call \u201cphysician-assisted dying\u201d.

"14||Charlie Gard medic decries 'soap opera' that stoked abuse of hospitalA member of the medical team that helped treat Charlie Gard has decried ill-informed politicians and religious leaders for stoking abuse of Great Ormond Street hospital and undermining confidence in the treatment of its young patients. The clinician said the furore over Charlie\u2019s case had already led some \u201cnervous parents\u201d of other children to start questioning the judgments of doctors in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit, fearing \u201cthey might not do the right thing for their child\u201d. The health worker said Charlie\u2019s case became a distressing soap opera for some commentators that had prolonged the agony of Charlie\u2019s parents. It had also clouded the heart-breaking truth that their son was critically ill and that the hospital was right to conclude it had done everything it could to save him. Charlie, the medic said, had effectively been kept alive for people such as Donald Trump and the pope, who \u201csuddenly knew more about mitochondrial diseases than our expert consultants\u201d. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to lose him, and we didn\u2019t want his mum and dad to be without him, but it\u2019s our job, our legal and moral obligation, to stand up for Charlie and say when we think: that enough is enough,\u201d the health worker said, writing in the Guardian. \u201cMy colleagues and I worked our hardest, tried everything, fought so hard for this family but there was nowhere else to go. It was obvious to all those people who treated him. \u201cWe gave him drugs and fluids, we did everything that we could, even though we thought he should be allowed to slip away in his parents\u2019 arms, peacefully, loved.\u201d Charlie died on 28 July, a week before his first birthday. He had a rare genetic disease that meant he needed to be on a life support system. His parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, fought a five-month court battle against Great Ormond Street, which had said his treatment should be stopped to prevent him suffering further. Gard and Yates ended their legal battle last week. The family had believed Charlie could still be treated, and questioned the analysis of experts at the hospital. But his parents gave up the challenge on Monday 24 July after accepting that their son no longer had any prospect of a meaningful life. In a statement read in court, Yates said the arguments with the hospital had wasted time \u2013 and that time had run out. The clinician who contacted the Guardian said the decision to speak out was highly unusual, but reflected how months of concern and frustration had taken a toll on staff in the 200-strong intensive care unit. The medic, who wrote on condition of anonymity, said colleagues had been deeply affected by the case and were shocked to become the target of \u201chorrendous and offensive\u201d abuse online and also from campaigners who camped outside the hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s things like \u2018why are you trying to kill this child? You are all murderers\u2019. It is horrendous and offensive. It is my job to stop people from dying, not to kill them.\u201d The team of healthcare professionals also felt dismayed by interventions from people who \u201cknew nothing\u201d about the condition Charlie suffered from, or the care he had been given. \u201cOver the last few weeks, parts of the media and some members of the public have turned a poorly baby\u2019s life into a soap opera, into a hot legal issue being discussed around the world. \u201cThe case has also had an effect on other families here. Parents are nervous, they worry that we might not do the right thing for their child. That worry is not based on the care we are giving; it\u2019s based on what you have been saying about medical staff you have never met.\u201d The worker criticised the \u201ckeyboard warriors\u201d who have bombarded social media with opinions and messages calling hospital staff \u201cevil\u201d for wanting to give Charlie palliative care until he dies. \u201cYou have contributed to the family\u2019s pain, you have been fighting a cause you know nothing about. It\u2019s not been helpful to anyone.\u201d They added that no healthcare professional wants to give up on a patient. \u201cThat\u2019s not why we go into care \u2026 It\u2019s our whole reason for being to keep these children alive, to give them back to their parents with as great a quality of life as we possibly can.\u201d They said that while the general public may eventually forget about Charlie, he will remain in the memories of his family and those that have cared for him. \u201cHis parents will live with this forever; they will go over and over whether they made the right choices for their beautiful baby. \u201cThe parents\u2019 pain will be unimaginable, their loss immeasurable and incomparable. But we will live with this for ever, too.\u201d They added that there are very few instances where parents and medical staff disagree over a patient\u2019s care to such an extent that legal action is taken; some cases go to court but the shock of initial proceedings is usually enough to reopen discussions where the two parties can come to a mutual decision. The case had previously gone to the European court of human rights, with judges at every turn backing the view of Great Ormond Street doctors who said Charlie\u2019s condition was irreversible and that further treatment could cause him suffering. The hospital requested a new hearing after receiving two letters \u2013 one from seven doctors and another from a solicitor representing Charlie\u2019s parents \u2013 claiming the chances of the treatment being successful were higher than previously thought. But the hospital was critical of Dr Michio Hirano, an eminent doctor and expert in his field, who had suggested Charlie could still be treated. The hospital criticised Hirano for not declaring earlier his \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in some of the drugs he wanted to prescribe. This article was corrected on 14 August 2017 to remove a reference to Boris Johnson being among those who believed they knew more than medical experts. The foreign secretary said at the time that decisions on the case should be led by such experts."
"14||It was our agonising job as Charlie Gard's care team to say: enoughOver the last few months, Charlie Gard\u2019s case attracted worldwide attention and divided opinion among politicians, religious leaders and medical specialists. The only voices not heard so far are those of the staff in the intensive care unit at Great Ormond Street hospital (Gosh), some of whom received death threats. Here, one of the team involved in Charlie\u2019s care describes the agony of looking after a child with his rare condition. On the one hand, trying to help a family desperate to save their only child; on the other, the need for the hospital to do what it believed to be in his best interests. I\u2019ve been part of a team of 200 nurses, doctors and consultants who cared for Charlie Gard, not just doing all the medical interventions he required but also washing him, cuddling him, propping up his toys around his cot. Like all of the staff who work in our unit, I loved this child to bits. But it got to the point where there was nothing more we could do. I know everyone working in intensive care would agree with me when I say that every child who comes through this unit is loved, but there are a few who take a piece of your heart with them when they leave. Some who have wonderful parents, some who have sad stories, some who you just work so hard to save that when you can\u2019t, it hurts your soul just a little bit. It\u2019s not just our job; it\u2019s our whole reason for being to keep these children alive, to give them back to their parents with as great a quality of life as we possibly can. We miss breaks, we stay late, we spend our days off researching and studying so that we can be better at what we do. We cry on the tube when we\u2019re not winning. We dream of nothing else. Have you ever really met a nurse or doctor who wants a child to die? We didn\u2019t want to lose Charlie, and we didn\u2019t want his mum and dad to be without him, but it\u2019s our job, our legal and moral obligation, to stand up for him and say when we think that enough is enough. There are few people in the world who are more injured by doing that than someone who has chosen to work in intensive care; it\u2019s not in our nature to stop fighting, but sometimes it\u2019s just not the right thing to do any more. My colleagues and I worked our hardest, tried everything, fought so hard for this family but there was nowhere else to go. It was obvious to all those people who treated him. We gave him drugs and fluids, we did everything that we could, even though we thought he should be allowed to slip away in his parents\u2019 arms, peacefully, loved. We didn\u2019t do this for Charlie. We didn\u2019t even do it for his mum and dad. Recently, we did this for Donald Trump and the pope, who suddenly knew more about mitochondrial diseases than our expert consultants. And we did it for the keyboard warriors who thought it was OK to write about the \u201cevil\u201d medical staff at Great Ormond Street, even though we were still there next to Charlie, caring for him as best we could, as we always had. We did it with every fibre of our being telling us that it was wrong, we should stop. But we couldn\u2019t. Over the last few weeks, parts of the media and some members of the public turned a poorly baby\u2019s life into a soap opera, into a hot legal issue being discussed around the world. Working in the intensive care unit is like living in a bubble at the best of times, but this went too far. I used to be proud to tell people I work here, but not now. Even my friends have asked me: \u201cWhy are you trying to kill this child?\u201d That\u2019s not what we do at Gosh. It\u2019s not why we go into care. It upset my colleagues \u2013 I\u2019ve watched them be affected. The case has also had an effect on other families here. Parents are nervous, they worry that we might not do the right thing for their child. That worry is not based on the care we are giving; it\u2019s based on what you have been saying about medical staff you have never met. So next time you feel like commenting on social media about how awful we are, please try to remember how hard we work to stop children from dying every day; please try to remember that Charlie\u2019s parents read those comments; please try to remember Charlie, who chose none of this. You have contributed to the family\u2019s pain, you have been fighting a cause you know nothing about. It\u2019s not been helpful to anyone. You will forget about Charlie, you\u2019ll carry on with your life. His parents will live with this for ever. They will go over and over whether they made the right choices for their beautiful baby, whether they were strong enough to make those choices amid the fury of you watching a drama unfold from behind your screen. The parents\u2019 pain will be unimaginable, their loss immeasurable and incomparable. But we will live with this for ever, too.

"7||League One and League Two: a fan from each club previews the 2017\u201318 seasonAFC Wimbledon It would be nice to stay clear of relegation and have a comfortable season with a few big wins to keep us going. I\u2019d like a number of our younger players to establish themselves here rather than being bought by Premier League clubs. One to watch: Kwesi Appiah is a Ghana international with bags of potential. He was great during a previous loan spell with us in 2014 but needs to keep fit and have a good run of games. Jack Blackburn Rovers The scenario is simple; we expect an immediate return to the second tier. Popular managers haven\u2019t exactly been a regular fixture at Ewood Park in these dark and difficult times, but in the popular Tony Mowbray the supporters finally sense a source of light and aspiration. A positive summer began with the news that Mowbray would be staying on, coupled with regular and astute signings and a resistance to the expected exodus of existing talent. There\u2019s a buzz around the better half of East Lancashire at the moment, with many fans excited about ticking off new destinations, being a bigger fish in a smaller pond, and just generally looking forward to watching a winning team again. Let\u2019s hope that reality meets expectation. One to watch: Only a decade ago, Rovers were in the Prmeier League and signing the likes of Roque Santa Cruz from Bayern Munich. So it\u2019s a sign of the times that we are all relatively ecstatic about the capture of the equally dashing Bradley Dack from Gillingham. The fact that tears were shed in South Glamorgan over Peter Whittingham illustrates what a great signing he may prove to be at this level, while Ben Gladwin\u2019s pre-season performances suggest he could slip under the radar and be a very useful player as part of a much-needed renovation job in central midfield. Of those retained, Charlie Mulgrew, Craig Conway and Danny Graham should have the qualities to light up the division. Craig R Haydock Blackpool Last season\u2019s promotion after two successive relegations was an unexpected surprise. Much of the credit must go to Gary Bowyer, whose calm and astute management has been very impressive in the face of the off-pitch issues which have bedevilled the club in recent years. There is a big step-up in quality between Leagues Two and One, so a mid-table finish would be a very decent achievement. Regardless of where we finish in the league my greatest hope is that we finally see an end to the the Oyston ownership of our club. One to watch: Bright Osayi-Samuel is an exciting talent; a quick and tricky winger who can be unplayable on his day. If he continues to progress and can deliver consistently, we might produce another Trevor Sinclair. Terry O\u2019Cleirigh Bradford City After two seasons of play-off heartache, Stuart McCall\u2019s men will be aiming for automatic promotion this time. The team racked up 19 league draws last season; they dominated possession but were pedestrian in the final third. The squad needed to convert at least some of those draws into wins. City have signed four strikers to add to the two in the January window, though losing the mercurial Mark Marshall to Charlton will hurt. The absence of any real big hitters in the league will further our case for a top-two finish. One to watch: Charlie Wyke, signed in January, hit the ground running with six goals in his first 10 games but then stalled. Wyke could be a 20-goal-a-season man if he can recapture his early form. We\u2019re also excited to see Shay McCarten purely because at \u00a3200,000 he cost 20 times more than we\u2019ve spent on anyone in the last five years! Stuart Henry Bristol Rovers After witnessing two relegations and a slow start to their non-league campaign in 2015, the club have gone from strength to strength under the guidance of sought-after manager Darrell Clarke. Rovers have an excellent chance of making the play-offs, if not the automatic promotion places. Clarke has strengthened the squad and there is now strong competition in all positions. One to watch: Tom Nichols and Liam Sercombe could prove to be two of the canniest signings made by any League One side. Joff England Bury With the signings we\u2019ve made and Lee Clark getting rid of deadwood in last year\u2019s squad, we have a good chance of reaching the play-offs. A trip to Wembley is the dream, but not in the Checkatrade Trophy. A good run in the FA Cup, culminating with a visit to a Premier League ground, would be brilliant. One to watch: Jermaine Beckford. He was a pivotal part in Preston\u2019s promotion campaign a couple of seasons ago scoring lots of goals. He\u2019ll need to fill the huge gap left by fans\u2019 favourite James Vaughan, who was our top scorer last season and a great leader in a brief stint as captain. Nick Round Charlton Athletic Charlton are so unpredictable. The ambition is promotion, as it should be for a club of our size. Transfer business has been a bit mixed. Jay Dasilva back on loan is good; bringing Stephy Mavididi back on loan from Arsenal would also be welcome. Keeping hold of Ricky Holmes was probably the best bit of business for us. The jury is still out on Karl Robinson, but if we can find a goalscorer and some consistency we\u2019ll make the play-offs. One to watch: Ricky Holmes. Quite simply our best player. Works super hard and is a game-changer. Also Ezri Konsa, a young centre back who will be playing at a higher level sooner rather than later. Probably not at The Valley sadly. Paul Wright Doncaster Rovers Only one of our last six seasons hasn\u2019t ended in either relegation or promotion, so forgive us if we hope for a bit of peace and quiet this season. Some consolidation that enables us to settle and build a squad for the future would be most welcome. But then that\u2019d be boring, so stick us down for a long overdue FA Cup run and a late, heroic, but ultimately fruitless push for the play-offs. One to watch: James Coppinger. Always James Coppinger. This will be his 14th season at Rovers and he\u2019s still one of those rare players who, whenever he receives the ball, has you craning forward in your seat in anticipation of what he will do next. Contemplating Rovers without him now is like contemplating fish and chips without vinegar; you know it exists and that some people seem to enjoy it, but it couldn\u2019t possibly be as magic. Glen Wilson Fleetwood Town Will last season\u2019s play-off heartache be as good as it gets for us? I\u2019m not sure this season will be anywhere near as positive. Yes, we\u2019ve kept hold of Uwe Rosler but a lot of experienced players have departed for supposedly better things, including tireless right-back Conor McLaughlin. I\u2019d still expect a top-half finish, but another play-off push might be beyond us as more squad rebuilding has been necessary this summer. One to watch: Kyle Dempsey was great for us on loan last season from Huddersfield and it\u2019s a fantastic bit of business to have signed him up permanently. Alex Cairns also has the potential to be one of the best goalies in the league. Carl Gillingham Avoid relegation and most of us will be happy! Having sacked Justin Edinburgh midway through last season and appointed ex-skipper Ady Pennock, we only stayed up on goal difference on the final day. There were plenty of off-field problems but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be first to admit that his points return was nowhere near good enough. This summer we have lost Cody McDonald to AFC Wimbledon and former League One player of the year Bradley Dack to rivals Blackburn. The play-offs are always an ambition but realistically staying up is the aim \u2013 and Pennock\u2019s job will depend on it. One to watch: Liam Nash. Signed from non-league outfit Maldon &amp; Tiptree, where he scored a hatful of goals, and he has looked sharp in pre-season. Matt Griffiths MK Dons After two poor seasons, there is a breath of fresh air in the club with the arrival of Robbie Neilson. I hope we achieve automatic promotion but a play-offs place is more likely. One to watch: Ousseynou Ciss\u00e9. The Malian defensive midfielder can also play in a back four and looks a really good acquisition. Matt Northampton Town I expect a solid mid-table finish, if not a sneaky play-off push. The recent influx of money has heightened expectations, but has also heightened the pressure on Justin Edinburgh\u2019s shoulders. One to watch: Matt Crooks and Billy Waters. Crooks comes highly rated with from his loan spell last year at a high flying Scunthorpe. Billy Waters has already shown in pre season his ability and pace with the ball. Adam Clarke Oldham Athletic I\u2019d be happy to avoid a relegation scrap \u2013 and I think we will. We ended last season well with John Sheridan back and we\u2019ve kept a lot of the squad together. Defensively we look sound, but Peter Clarke\u2019s legs will go at one point. We need someone to score goals though. We are the bookies\u2019 favourites to go down but League One often throws up the unexpected. I think we\u2019ll finish halfway up. One to watch: Courtney Duffus, the striker who has signed from Everton. He was linked with Brighton in January and he scored on his friendly debut against Accrington. Is he the goalscorer the club has cried out for in recent seasons? Ryan Hamer Oxford United The hope is that the consistent progress made over the past three seasons under Daryl Eales\u2019 ownership, with Michael Appleton at the helm, continues. Pep Clotet taking over is a leap into the unknown, but retaining the infrastructure had to be the key decision in the appointment and, with the backroom team remaining in place, there\u2019s stability at the club. Progress means seventh or better but another top 10 would hardly be a disaster. A crack at the play-offs is not out of the question. One to watch: Marvin Johnson is an eye-catching winger. This could also be the breakthrough season for young Josh Ruffels. Keith Harris Peterborough United The mood in the camp seems more determined than in recent seasons and, with David Oldfield back as assistant manager, we have a good chance of promotion this year. One to watch: We have a few new signings such as Michael Doughty from QPR and Alex Penny from Nuneaton, but I\u2019m most looking forward to local lad and Posh fan Ricky Miller leading the line and scoring the goals along with Jack Marriot to lead us to glory. Jeremy Plymouth Argyle We have a really good manager in Derek Adams. We have a sound chairman and great fans. The squad has been strengthened over the summer and at last the club seems to be really moving forward. A lot of fans say they would be happy with mid-table, but I think they\u2019re trying to limit the disappointment if things don\u2019t turn out so well. We\u2019ll be up there in the mix. It might not happen from the off but Adams will do what needs to be done to get a result. Look at his record; he doesn\u2019t do \u201caverage seasons.\u201d One to watch: Like everyone I enjoy watching Graham Carey. It\u2019s a great bonus that we managed to hang on to him for another season. But generally Argyle haven\u2019t been about a single player. It\u2019s about a good, solid team that wants the result. I would be excited if we sign a good striker \u2013 something we have slightly lacked over the last couple of seasons. Tom Widdicombe Portsmouth Another promotion would be fantastic and not entirely unrealistic. Losing Paul Cook but gaining Kenny Jackett hasn\u2019t made anybody lose any sleep since winning League Two last season. We\u2019ve now been bought by American billionaire Michael Eisner so we\u2019re surely looking to push on now. One to watch: Taking a player of the calibre of Brett Pitman down a league will be very interesting. He is a proven goalscorer in both Championship and, more importantly, League One. Martin Daniels Rochdale We have to aim as high as possible and there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t go for promotion this season. Keith Hill continues to impress and will reap the rewards sooner rather than later. One to watch: Josh Lillis is one of the best goalkeepers in League One. He will take some beating this season. JKM Rotherham United After a terrible time in the Championship last season, I\u2019m hoping for us to mount a challenge for the play-offs and go on a good cup run. We have a much more competitive squad than last season. One to watch: I\u2019m excited to see how Jon Taylor will perform in League One, which looks to be his level. Harry Scunthorpe United We\u2019ve lost some players but our target should be promotion to the Championship. One to watch: Kevin van Veen is one of our most eye-catching players. He has such a fantastic touch and has scored some unbelievable goals. Marc Hill Shrewsbury Town We just beat Villa and Wolves in pre-season. That might be as good as it gets this season. Our signings have been a mixture of loans with a bit of pedigree and National League level players. Our manager was in the National League only two years ago, so I\u2019m hoping he knows something we don\u2019t. None of us have a clue how everything might pan out. One to watch: Out of the current crop, no one excites me as much as players that have been here on loan in previous seasons. Our Under-20 World Cup winning goalkeeper Dean Henderson, on loan from Manchester United, might attract a bit of attention. We\u2019ve got winger Daniel James on loan from Swansea who has played for Wales. He might be alright. But the players who I\u2019m praying for are the National League signings. I don\u2019t think the New Meadow will overwhelm them, I\u2019m just hoping they\u2019ll be up to the task. Sam Brown Southend United After narrowly missing out on the play-offs last season, they must be the minimum aim this season. A few players have left, but the chairman is fighting to retain Ryan Leonard, the engine room of the team, rejecting bids from the Championship and insisting he is not for sale. There have only been a couple of additions so far but they have been quality: experienced centre-back Michael Turner and quality forward Michael Kightly, who is coming back to the team where his professional career started. One to watch: Michael Kightly. He showed promise as a 17-year-old but was considered surplus to requirements. He grew from that experience and went on to grace the Premier League. He should really be playing in the Championship at least. Lets hope he\u2019s doing that for Southend next year. Barry Labs Walsall I hope that the club surprises us once again by outperforming our budget and resources, but we appear to be heading for relegation. We have, with one exception, a mostly new back five, no width, little creativity and, most worrying of all, no firepower. We have two strikers who do not score goals and a style of play that does not work to their advantage. Oh, and throw in an inexperienced manager who, if we start poorly, may not see autumn. Several players have been sold for decent money, but the money has not come back into player acquisitions. It\u2019s shaping up to be a typical Walsall season, which is why I\u2019m looking forward to getting it started! One to watch: Erhun Oztumer. He\u2019s the Turkish Messi. Well, in League One anyway. He scores some absolute wonder goals and is our only really creative player. Stuart Smith Wigan Athletic Promotion has to be the aim, plain and simple. After a season of unnecessary upheaval last time out, which resulted in Latics being relegated back to League One, we need to try to get back to the Championship at the first attempt. But possibly more important than any promotion ambitions is for the club to regain some stability. For a club that was the model of stability in its eight years in the Premier League, it has fallen short in recent times. Six managers in four years tells its own story. Hopefully former player and new manager Paul Cook can bring back that stability. Wiganers will tell you they had a fantastic time when we were in League One last time. A similar campaign this time around would be most welcome. One to watch: Wigan have players that should be the envy of any club at this level. If they can keep the bulk of the squad together before the transfer window closes \u2013 and in the case of the likes of Will Grigg and Nick Powell keep them fit \u2013 the Latics should be able to compete with the top sides in the division. Although Will Grigg set League One on fire last time, a fully firing Nick Powell could be an unbelievable talent at this level. The key is to get his attitude right. If Paul Cook can get his head right, he\u2019ll have an unbelievable talent on his hands. Sean Livesey Accrington Stanley We could have a successful season building on the past two seasons and go for a play-off spot. This is the first season in a while where we\u2019ve had a squad to build around from last season which makes me believe this goal is reachable. One to watch: We\u2019ve made a couple of good signings this summer. One of those is Mekhi McLeod, who has impressed in pre-season. He\u2019s an exciting player who brings a bit of electricity to the team and looks hungry for the ball and to score as well as create chances. Another player who caught my eye is Ben Richards-Everton who is a centre back. He\u2019s a strong lad and, after watching him pair up with the centre backs from last year, he looks at home and I\u2019m excited to watch him this season. Dylan Barnet It would be easy for outside observers to be sceptical of Barnet\u2019s chances this campaign. The Bees saw hopes of the play-offs slip away thanks to a poor second half to last season and only a couple of players have been added to the squad at the time of writing. That doesn\u2019t tell the full story, however. Barnet have the core of a good side and a handful of exciting prospects who have come through the club\u2019s youth academy. While they were hampered by numerous managerial changes in 2016-17, they are now led by the EFL\u2019s youngest manager, Ross Eames, who did an excellent job as caretaker last year. He has implemented an exciting, passing style since taking the reins permanently, and his side have beaten higher division opponents such as Swansea City and Millwall in pre-season. The play-offs will be the aim but I can see Barnet falling short but finishing in the top half of the table. One to watch: Barnet\u2019s prospects will be largely dependent on John Akinde, their colossal all-time Football League top scorer. The striker has scored 20+ goals in each of the previous three campaigns and carried a side that was, at times, woefully short of goals last term. The rest of the team will have to find the back of the net more frequently if they are to prosper this season. Will Evans Cambridge United Realistically, we should aim to finish in the play-off positions. Last season runs of good results were interspersed with some calamitous defeats to weaker opposition. Goals were not always easy to come by. The 1-0 home defeat to Hartlepool on a Tuesday night in March still galls. Combined with our dreadful start, with no win in our first eight games, a mid-table finish was indicative of a lack of consistency. The recruitment team appears to have made a considerable effort to bolster the depth of the squad this year. We are a large physical side and the focus of recruitment this year seems to have continued in this vein. Incoming, among others, are experienced campaigner Jabo Ibehre, midfield workhorse Gary Deegan and the promising Emmanuel Osadebe from League One side Gillingham. Retaining Luke Berry, scorer of 22 goals last season from midfield, is key. With the mountainous Uche Ikpeazu up front, the football tends to be direct and the default plan tends to be hitting him early. Many regulars are vocal in their desire for a more aesthetically pleasing brand of football. With greater forward options and a seemingly better standard of squad depth, it remains to be seen if Shaun Derry has the will to develop that style of play. Turning a few draws into wins could see us into those elusive play-off spots. One to watch: Emmanuel Osadebe. Left Gillingham under a cloud regarding his attitude and application but has all the requisite tools to dominate at this level despite his young age. Agressive, fast, strong and tenacious he really could be the difference this year. Matt Jolley Carlisle United Hopes are high after last season\u2019s play-offs. This season we should push for automatic promotion, preferably as champions. One to watch: Nicky Adams. The midfielder works his socks off and is a creative catalyst. Alan Sinclair Cheltenham Town I\u2019m almost totally half-confident that we will brush aside the likes of Crawley, Swindon and Forest Green... Also, this will be the season we unveil the electronic scoreboard to end all electronic scoreboards. So yeah, that\u2019ll be fun to watch. Can\u2019t wait. One to watch: Mohamed Eisa, whom we signed from Greenwich Borough in the Ryman League. He\u2019s looked electric in some otherwise underwhelming pre-season games. And no one has said he\u2019s the next Jamie Vardy yet, which means we might be able to keep hold of him for a little while longer. Charlie Gilbert Chesterfield After finishing bottom of League One, this season can\u2019t be any worse, can it? My hopes are for the play-offs. But this is basically a new side from the one that got relegated. We\u2019ve had great success in this league with two promotions in recent years. Time will tell if we can replicate them. One to watch: Chris O\u2019Grady should score and be involved with lots of goals this season. He looks a real coup for this division. Jake Kilcline Colchester United I would like to see the club pushing for promotion back to League One, either through the play-offs or automatically. Injuries hurt the side\u2019s progress last year, when we were so close to making the play-offs. Hopefully we can keep everyone fit, add a couple of new players and challenge for promotion. One to watch: Brennan Dickenson is unfortunately injured and would undoubtedly have left the club in the summer if he remained fit. Dickenson contributed 12 goals and seven assists from left wing-back last season and will be a key player once he returns to fitness. Kurtis Guthrie scored 12 in 33 league games before injury curtailed his season early last term. He\u2019ll be another one to watch and will surely spearhead our attack. Dave Coventry City Last season was possibly the worst in Coventry City\u2019s already demoralising history. Paradoxically, it also contained a day to cherish forever, as we lifted the Checkatrade Trophy at Wembley in front of 44,000 Coventry fans. The team played better that day than I\u2019ve seen any Coventry team play in years and I hope that they can find a way to capture the spirit of day and apply it to every game of what is bound to be a frustrating, long, brutal season. Returning manager Mark Robins has been hard at work overhauling the squad post-relegation and, with a good mixture of experience and promising youth among the signings, Coventry fans are guardedly optimistic of a serious challenge for promotion from League Two \u2013 and I am among them. One to watch: Jordan Ponticelli. A very exciting product of our youth academy who spent last season banging them in for fun for our youth and reserve teams. Relegation may prove to be his big chance to make himself known. Adrian Wilson Crawley Town I would love to finish in an automatic promotion place or a play-off spot at least. It\u2019s not too crucial, but being the top goalscorers would be nice too. One to watch: Dean Cox. The former Leyton Orient and Brighton forward missed the first half of the season last year and has now had a full pre-season under his belt. Creative, great balance and an eye for goal. He\u2019s the best player at the club and hopefully he can have an excellent season. Mark Crewe Alexandra Hopes have been raised by a decent end to last season since Dave Artell\u2019s managerial appointment. And decent experienced signings have raised hopes of a promotion push. One to watch: Brad Walker may be one to watch of the new signings. George Cooper should continue to progress from the academy graduates. Chris Judson Exeter City Having been defeated at Wembley last year, Exeter fans are hoping the team can go one better this time around. Despite the loss of last year\u2019s EFL young player of the year Ollie Watkins, the current squad is more than capable of achieving promotion. If we can improve our home form, we can challenge for an automatic promotion place. One to watch: It was great to see full-back Dean Moxey return to the club after eight years, having gained valuable experience at clubs such as Crystal Palace and Derby. Having reportedly rejected offers from bigger clubs, it\u2019ll be very exciting to see how Moxey will fare in his second stint at St James Park. Nathan Forest Green Rovers This season is our first in the Football League. It\u2019s very important that we start very strongly, just to ease any potential doubts. But we should have more than enough quality in the squad to survive comfortably. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have enough quality to \u201cdo a Stevenage\u201d though. Finally, it\u2019s important for the club to retain our unique vegan values, something I hope visiting fans will enjoy. One to watch: Our captain, Liam Noble, leads by example and has recently ignored interest by Notts County to sign a new deal. But it\u2019s 27-goal striker Christian Doidge who has a point to prove after misfiring in League Two for Dagenham and Redbridge a few years ago. Now aged 24 and full of confidence, he should reach the 20-goal barrier. Hugo Leford-Brown Grimsby Town With Russell Slade back at the helm and an intent on playing passing football, quite a few people are feeling quietly optimistic. One to watch: If we sign him on a permanent deal, Moroccan triallist Kamal Ait El Haj looks like one to watch just in front of the back four. If not Sam Jones up front will hopefully replace the void left by Omar Bogle. Thomas Sargent Lincoln City I hope for a season that builds on the huge progress the club made last season, both on and off the field. We\u2019ve sold more than 5,500 season tickets and I can see no reason why we can\u2019t harness that incredible support and mount a genuine promotion push. One to watch: Michael Bostwick is surely one of the most eye-catching League Two acquisitions of the summer. Peterborough\u2019s player of the season last year reportedly turned down Blackburn Rovers to join the Imps\u2019 nascent assault on the Football League. Ben Allen Luton Town Like many Luton fans, I have an (often unrealistic) expectation of fighting for promotion each season. This season though, considering the quality of the teams that have been promoted from and relegated into League Two, automatic promotion has to be the club\u2019s goal. The play-offs simply aren\u2019t our cup of tea. The signings we\u2019ve made look promising, particularly having three permanent goalkeepers compared to last season\u2019s zero. The outfield purchases also look to be more in-tune with Nathan Jone\u2019s desire to play a diamond in midfield than our squad last season. Ultimately automatic promotion and a big team in the third round of the FA Cup will be more than enough for me and most other Hatters. One to watch: Andrew Shinnie, who we\u2019ve signed on loan from Birmingham. Many seem to think he is Championship quality but just hasn\u2019t been given the opportunities. Having lost Cameron McGeehan to Barnsley, a creative and classy midfielder was needed. Hopefully Shinnie is just the man for the job. JGM Mansfield Town I hope we can at least make the play-offs. There\u2019s a huge buzz around the club before Steve Evans\u2019 first full season in charge and, with 13 new signings, there has been a big overhaul of last seasons squad. We have shipped 12 out and did our business early, which can only be a positive. We still lack that killer striker but the signings we have made have been impressive. Evans is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea but he\u2019s a proven winner. One to watch: The signing of David Mirfin from Scunthorpe definitely caught the eye and also Jacob Mellis from Bury. But our signing of the season could be Paul Digby, the towering, box-to-box central midfielder who can also play at the back. He has played Championship football for Barnsley and has gone under the radar a little bit. Jack Richardson Morecambe With all the off-field nonsense last season, I\u2019d be happy for the club just to settle down this year. We have no chance of chasing the leading pack, but should comfortably avoid any relegation threat. One to watch: Adam Campbell needs to be our main man in front of goal this season. There\u2019s surely only so much that can be expected from 38-year-old club legend Kevin Ellison. Adam Chain Newport County I would take 22nd again now, but I would love a season of not having to worry about relegation at all. Mid-table obscurity would suit me just fine. We have kept the core of the squad, added some interesting players and are on a real high after last season\u2019s dramatic great escape. I am quietly optimistic we can have a good year. One to watch: It will be interesting to see what Frank Nouble can bring. We have been searching for a goalscorer for the last few seasons. Owain Bright Notts County My main hope is, as always, a better finish than the previous season. That should mean comfortable mid-table with, if we are lucky, a brief flirtation with the top seven. Summer recruitment has been slow but steady and I have faith in Kevin Nolan\u2019s ability to get the best out of his squad. The defence remains a cause for concern, having more holes than your gran\u2019s favourite colander and, given that this is Notts, the season will have probably fallen apart by October. If Nolan hangs around until next May, we will be alright. One to watch: Jorge Grant, whose return on loan from Forest is a huge boost. Gets goals from midfield and actually provides a creative spark in an otherwise pretty one dimensional side. Simon Patrick Port Vale My hope is that we avoid another catastrophe like last season. We lost many of our best out-of-contract players before the 2016-17 campaign and the Bruno Ribeiro experiment just didn\u2019t work. Consolidation under Michael Brown, most of the squad staying fit and no more public outbursts from our chairman would be just fine. One to watch: We\u2019ve signed striker Rekeil Pyke on loan from Huddersfield, who\u2019s scored six goals in pre-season and is apparently very highly rated. He looks to have formed a good partnership with the returning talisman Tom Pope already so that bodes well. It\u2019s worth keeping an eye out for wingers Marcus Harness and Cristian Montano, who have both impressed in pre-season. Ted Stevenage I have very positive hopes for the season. Our manager has brought in some very talented players who were needed to complete the jigsaw. If we start well and players stay fit, we can reach the top half of the table. One to watch: I\u2019m excited to see all of our boys, but the one who stands out is Jack King. He is such a good player and commands the whole team superbly. Matt Farley Swindon Town After a disappointing season last year, I\u2019m hoping for promotion. However, promotion is easier said than done. A lot of fans are confident we will go up but it won\u2019t be easy, especially with rival teams bringing in a bunch of quality players. One to watch: Harry Smith, a striker who has a good goals-to-game ratio and can hopefully continue scoring this season. Jackson Wycombe Wanderers After a season of ups and downs, Wycombe should be looking for consistency this season. An incredible run that included an FA Cup fourth round nearly got us to the play-offs but the talismanic Adebayo Akinfenwa\u2019s goals weren\u2019t quite enough. A decent crack at the play-offs should be considered good enough for most realistic supporters from a club with minimal resources and a small squad. With only one signing, staying as injury free as possible will be crucial. One to watch: Having, at this point, only signed Adam El-Abd there is a slight clamouring for the kind of player to get excited about in pre-season but a lot of the work was done last season. A fully fit Sam Saunders is a beautiful thing and having him supplying proven finishers Akinfenwa and Scott Kashket could be our ticket out of the division. James Watson Yeovil Town Relegation would be catastrophic for us so avoiding that is the main hope. Beyond that, a push for a play-off place at some point in the season would be nice and a mid-table finish would be great come May. We also need a good cup run this year. It\u2019s been too long. One to watch: Otis Khan has shown glimpses of magic over the past season. With a confidence-boosting run of good form, he could be a star for us. Christo Nation"

"19||Credit crunch, 10 years on: fate of RBS shows global crisis is not overTen years ago, Royal Bank of Scotland was battling with Barclays to take over a Dutch rival, ABN Amro. RBS eventually slapped \u00a349bn on the table and won. It was to be a transformational deal, and it certainly was \u2013 but not in any way that the boss of RBS at the time, Sir Fred Goodwin, had ever planned. Today, the Edinburgh-based bank is still displaying the damage caused by doing that deal. Still 71% owned by the taxpayer after a bailout in October 2008, the bank will once again sink to a big loss by the end of the year \u2013 its 10th consecutive year in the red. The story of RBS shows that, even now, the global financial crisis is having a profound impact. But it also raises another issue: has enough been done to prevent a repeat of the horrors of a decade ago, which began in August 2007? Given concern that the record low interest rates and electronic money printing that central banks resorted to in the face of the biggest recession since the 1930s are storing up problems for the future, the question is simple: has anything really changed? Those responsible for dealing with the crisis say there is little doubt about its lingering impact. Alistair Darling, who had been chancellor for little more than a month when the markets froze in early August 2007, said the events generated a sense of injustice that is still shaping politics today. \u201cVery few people would have thought, back in 2007, this will provoke an economic crisis that will still be under way 10 years later. Everything that\u2019s happening in the world just now \u2013 UK included \u2013 has to be seen in light of the backwash of what happened with the economic crash that followed the banking crash,\u201d said Lord Darling. Events moved swiftly 10 years ago. A month after the banks stopped lending to each other there was a run on Northern Rock \u2013 the first to affect a UK high street bank since Overend Gurney in the 1860s. A year later, Lehman Brothers collapsed in the US \u2013 triggering shockwaves through global markets. In the UK, the government bailed out RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. No longer an MP but now a Labour peer, Darling reckons it could happen again \u2013 but not for a long time. \u201cWhen the present generation is gone, the people who were in shock, a bright spark will come along and say \u2018I\u2019ve found a great way of making money\u2019 and there\u2019ll be nobody to say \u2018the last time we did that we went bust\u2019.\u201d Mervyn King, with whom Darling had a sometimes testy relationship during the crisis, agrees. Like most of those in the eye of the storm a decade ago, King thinks the financial system is in much better shape, but would be even healthier had Darling fully nationalised RBS and forced all the leading banks to take bailout cash, as happened in the US. Even so, he said, banks were stronger and individuals now had to take greater personal responsibility for their actions. \u201cIn that sense we are in a much better position, but the challenge for policymakers is not to worry about today but to worry about what happens in 20 years\u2019 time, when everyone will have forgotten about this,\u201d said Lord King. \u201cThat\u2019s what a central bank is all about, it\u2019s an organisation with institutional memory.\u201d His idea is for central banks to become a \u201cpawnbroker for all seasons\u201d \u2013 agreeing in advance the terms of any loans by a lender of last resort, helping to avoid the moral hazard problem where banks take risks because they know they are going to be bailed out. A senior Bank of England official, Alex Brazier, has recently warned about banks dicing with a \u201cspiral of complacency\u201d in their consumer lending \u2013 when borrowing on credit cards, via unsecured loans and car loan schemes has topped the \u00a3200bn level for the first time since the crisis. Paul Myners, a former fund manger who was City minister during the banking crisis, is concerned. \u201cEven a return to normal interest rates of inflation plus one or two per cent would have quite substantial impacts on a lot of borrowers ... You start to run scenarios in which interest rates are higher and the economy is not going so well and the default risk in property, consumer credit and car loans will increase dramatically,\u201d said Lord Myners. He does not, however, think we are on the verge of another collapse. But he does believe there should be more scrutiny of shadow banking \u2013 where fund managers, insurance companies and hedge funds conduct bank-like activities with less regulation. Adair Turner, who became chairman of the Financial Services Authority in the month that Lehman Brothers went bust, worries that the complex, off-balance-sheet financial instruments that dominated the 2007 crisis \u2013 such as special investment vehicles (SIV) \u2013 have now become a feature of the financial regime in China, the world\u2019s second biggest economy. Lord Turner reckons the authorities in Beijing could contain a financial crisis \u2013 but the inevitable slowdown in the Chinese economy that would follow would prove costly to the rest of the world. But he also believes that after 10 years of record stimulus \u2013 low interest rates and electronic money printing through quantitative easing \u2013 the world may be ill equipped to cope with another recession. \u201cThe big thing sitting behind the global economy is even, after years and years of very low and even negative interest rates, all we are getting to is barely adequate growth rates and inflation still below target. So if in that environment you have a significant downward shock, what do the central banks do next?\u201d After the crisis, the FSA was shut down in a regulatory overhaul . The Bank of England was handed back powers to oversee the biggest lenders and a new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), was set up to monitor how financial firms behaved. There was a big push to force all the strategically important global banks to increase the amount of capital they held against possible losses. Turner, who chaired the now defunct FSA until 2013, said: \u201cI think the financial system is now much more resilient than what it was in 2007-08.\u201d Andrew Bailey, who now runs the FCA, was at the Bank of England during the crisis. He also cites the side-effects of a prolonged period of low interest rates. On Thursday, the Bank of England left interest rates unchanged at 0.25%. \u201cIf we put Brexit to one side, then the impact of sustained low and negative real interest rates is the biggest issue we face,\u201d said Bailey, pointing to research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing the gap between young people and the older generation. Darling points to the social and political impact of the years following the crisis. \u201cIf you look at the politics that have seen Trump elected, the politics in the UK today, of Brexit, a lot of it has got to do with the backwash of that time, where people have seen their incomes squeezed, if not reduced. People are worried about the security of employment.\u201d The consequence of the credit crunch and the global financial crisis, he concludes, is \u201c a millennial generation who are now poorer than the generation which came before them\u201d."
"13||Salt review \u2013 one-woman show retraces the transatlantic slave routeTim Etchells of the experimental theatre company Forced Entertainment once wrote a superb essay on the risks that come when an artist is genuinely invested in what they are doing on stage \u2013 how it exposes them and how the audience recognises this and is laid bare, too. Selina Thompson\u2019s one-woman show, in which she draws upon her journey retracing the transatlantic slave triangle from Britain to Ghana to Jamaica and back, is theatre that does just that. And not just because she asks the first three rows of the audience to don safety goggles when she takes swings at pink salty rocks with a pickaxe. This piece is about a personal journey that Thompson made but it is also about the journeys of millions of black men, women and children. They were sold in the slave trade on which the wealth of Europe was built, providing the foundations of its economic success today. On a cargo ship to Ghana, Thompson encounters contemporary racism: cruel, casual, completely normalised. At the former trading fort of Elmina castle, Ghana, she stands before the Gate of No Return that faces the Atlantic ocean. Salt is a piece that is so haunted by absence \u2013 of the many who died in Elmina, during their voyages and on the plantations \u2013 that the traumas of the past become palpably present. How, asks Thompson, can this grief coexist in a world of post offices and perfume diffusers? This show is, as she says, her \u201cact of remembrance and grief\u201d but it is also our burden. Lest we forget, at the end she gives us all a small piece of rock. For the rest of the day, I feel its weight in my pocket, its rough edges a sharp reminder. The performance is delivered with the lightest of touches, as Thompson stands before us in a white dress and adopts an easy, conversational tone. As with Josette Bushell-Mingo\u2019s extraordinary Nina, which is at the Traverse in Edinburgh, this is a piece suffused with anger at the fact that it even has to be asserted that black lives matter. It also uses humour to fine effect, not least in the wry conversations that Thompson has with her father, a man inclined to treat his daughter\u2019s stories with a pinch of salt. But then, this is a piece that offers the gift of seeing the world through different eyes. At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 26 August. Box office: 0131-226 0000."
"0||'Deep down, I knew it didn't happen': The woman who imagined a murderIn 1974, two men vanished in Iceland within the space of 10 months. The country\u2019s population was only 220,000, small enough for people to feel they knew each other. Crime was scant. But neither man was found. There were no witnesses, no forensic evidence \u2013 no bodies. After an intensive police investigation, six young men confessed to their part in the murders. Their confessions were spurred in part by the testimony of Erla Bolladottir, girlfriend of the group\u2019s alleged ringleader, S\u00e6var Ciesielski. Despite retracting their confessions, Ciesielski and four friends were convicted of murder; Bolladottir was convicted of perjury for attempting to implicate four other innocent men. The case, and Bolladottir\u2019s name, remain notorious in Iceland \u2013 at the time of the trial, she says that Ciesielski was painted by the media as a Charles Manson figure, and her as one of his devoted Family members. But over the decades, horror at the supposed crimes has been replaced with fears that an atrocious miscarriage of justice occurred. Now, more than 40 years later, with the special prosecutor in Iceland recommending that the case be reopened, Bolladottir has turned chief witness in Out of Thin Air, a feature-length documentary for BBC Storyville. The film, directed by Dylan Howitt, has a noirish feel, appropriately for a mystery which in Iceland is regarded as \u201ca black hole\u201d. But this is no whodunnit. The film raises many more questions than answers, and even talking to Bolladottir \u2013 during her visit to the UK to view the documentary \u2013 takes the story further into uncertainty. Bolladottir\u2019s part in the murder investigation began on 13 December 1975 when, aged 20, she was arrested for embezzlement. She confessed to the crime, which she had committed with Ciesielski. As the interview concluded she felt relieved to have got the story off her chest. She was also looking forward to going home; she and Ciesielski had an 11-week-old girl. But instead of letting her leave, the police officers threw her a question about Gu\u00f0mundur Einarsson, the first of the two men to have gone missing 11 months earlier. \u201cI was really tired. I was trying to accommodate them, but I didn\u2019t know anything,\u201d Bolladottir says. She told the police about a nightmare she had had on the night of Einarsson\u2019s disappearance. She dreamt that she lay in bed listening to voices outside the window. \u201cThey were whispering, \u2018Is she awake? Is she asleep?\u2019\u201d From those fragments, Bolladottir says, the police began to construct an alternate reality: \u201cThey tried to convince me that this had not been a nightmare.\u201d She was sent back to her cell, where over the next nine days, the questioning continued. \u201cThey really went into details. \u2018Why was a bedsheet in the bin? Had it been used to wrap the body?\u2019 I was trying to picture everything they told me.\u201d At a certain point, the effort to visualise the details described by the police produced in her mind a picture that was vivid enough to seem real. Now the bedsheet, which hadn\u2019t previously figured in Bolladottir\u2019s dream, was not only imaginable but memorable too. When the police asked, \u201cCould it have been like this?\u201d suddenly all things seemed possible. \u201cI couldn\u2019t deny that it could have been,\u201d she says. \u201cSomehow, between me and them, this story formed. And I never knew, did it come from me, or did it come from them?\u201d It seems unthinkable that Bolladottir, on the basis of such unstable recollections, would provide the testimony that helped to convict her boyfriend and his friends of murder. At one point, she claimed that she herself had killed Geirfinnur Einarsson with a shotgun. At another, she implicated her half-brother Einar along with three other men, all of whom were held for 105 days before being released without charge. It is the instability of memory itself that Howitt investigates. The film has the atmosphere of a thriller \u2013 it opens in darkness, a gun fires, snow falls, a door thunks shut on a green cell. And the softly spoken Bolladottir, reliving it all with undisguised bewilderment, is the ultimate unreliable narrator. Even now, she finds it hard to know what she knew. How much does she really remember of that night? She knows that she had the nightmare; and that she never had it again. And that the mental pictures of the murder have stayed in her head, \u201cas if it happened, you know? But it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d She now views these images as symptomatic of memory distrust syndrome, a condition originally identified by G\u00edsli Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsson, a professor of forensic psychology whose expert testimony helped overturn the convictions of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four. Central to the case is the amount of time Bolladottir, Ciesielski and his associates spent in solitary confinement. One of the group, Tryggvi R\u00fanar Leifsson, spent 655 days in solitary, the longest recorded stint outside Guant\u00e1namo Bay, while Bolladottir herself spent 242 days alone. All had infrequent access to lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re a split personality,\u201d she says. \u201cDeep down I knew it didn\u2019t happen. But somehow I wasn\u2019t sure at the same time.\u201d \u201cTime is so difficult to talk about [in detention]. It\u2019s all just one big universal time,\u201d she says. She became so distrusting of her own memory that she began to doubt she had even given birth. \u201cI tried to see my daughter\u2019s face, and I couldn\u2019t see it. I didn\u2019t want to ask anybody.\u201d She was scared if she did that she would never see her daughter again. \u201cI just waited and waited for something to confirm for me that I didn\u2019t imagine it.\u201d These days Bolladottir works as a project manager for an adult education centre that helps immigrants integrate in Reykjavik. But it took decades to integrate herself. \u201cThere was no life for me in the community,\u201d she says. People spat at her on the street. She struggled to find work. She lived for a while in Hawaii, with her sister, then after getting married she spent a few years in South Africa. She had two more daughters, now aged 27 and 21. When Bolladottir came back to Iceland in 1998, Ciesielski had been out of prison for more than a decade, fighting to clear his name. He had become homeless, and alcoholic, but before his death in 2011, the two managed to talk. So did Bolladottir apologise to Ciesielski for her part in his conviction? \u201cI did, I did,\u201d she says. \u201cFor a long time, no matter how drunk he was, that man \u2026 would come to my house and I couldn\u2019t take him inside because I had a family there. So we had an arrangement. He would ring the bell and I would go down to where we kept the bicycles. We had total peace there. We would just sit on the floor and talk for hours.\u201d It was during these conversations, she says, that she \u201ccame out of all uncertainty\u201d about his innocence. She is crying now. Life \u201cnever went back to normal\u201d, she says. Nor can it. Julia, her eldest daughter, is now 41 and, Bolladottir says, in touch with her half-siblings, Ciesielski\u2019s other children, who are also hoping to prove their father\u2019s innocence. But even if Ciesielski\u2019s conviction is overturned, along with that of his friends, Bolladottir will not be found innocent. Her own perjury conviction is unlikely to be re-examined. She plans to take her case to a private court. In the meantime, she hopes the film will tell the story of a miscarriage of justice for younger generations. \u201cBecause it\u2019s always going to surface,\u201d she says. \u201cThe film is my hope.\u201d Out of Thin Air will be broadcast on BBC Four on Monday 14 August and available on Netflix from September. This article was amended on 8 August 2107. The original version said Bolladottir had been in solitary confinement for 135 days rather than 242 days."
"12||Hywel Bennett obituaryThe actor Hywel Bennett, who has died aged 73, achieved his greatest fame as the thinking man\u2019s layabout in the title role of the hugely popular ITV sitcom Shelley. The character was a geography graduate with an analytical brain but no desire to work \u2013 a philosopher on a sofa. A handful of jobs failed to last and Shelley was in constant conflict with the tax office, his building society and his father-in-law, aided only by his sardonic wit and anti-establishment attitude. As a programme, Shelley was a slow-burner, but it caught on and initially ran for six series, from 1979 until 1984. Bennett\u2019s private life made headlines, and heavy drinking led him to book into a clinic in 1986. Repeats of the sitcom then led ITV to revive the series as The Return of Shelley (1988), before reverting to its original title for a final three runs between 1989 and 1992. Shelley was the brainchild of Peter Tilbury, who wrote most of the original episodes, with Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin scripting many of the later ones. \u201cThe writers had done something pretty amazing,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cThey had created what was almost a monologue and turned it into a popular sitcom.\u201d Bennett\u2019s TV popularity followed a false start for him as a star of the big screen \u2013 he was unfortunate to emerge at a time when the British film industry was in decline. His good looks and appearance in pictures that pushed the boundaries in the swinging 60s had made him a part of that vibrant era; it seemed appropriate that in 1970 he should marry Cathy McGowan, the fashion icon who had shot to fame presenting the TV pop show Ready Steady Go!. In Bennett\u2019s first film, The Family Way (1966), a comedy made by the Boulting brothers, John and Roy, with music by Paul McCartney, he played an impotent teenage husband opposite Hayley Mills. Two years later, he played Mills\u2019s stalker in Roy Boulting\u2019s psychological saga Twisted Nerve (1968), in which the drama turns to terror, and he was with her again in the Agatha Christie thriller Endless Night (1972), taking the role of a chauffeur marrying a wealthy heiress, then moving into a dream home that proves to be a nightmare. His most enduring film was The Virgin Soldiers (1969), based on Leslie Thomas\u2019s best-selling novel about national service recruits in Singapore dealing with a guerrilla uprising against the colonial administration in Malaya. Bennett starred as a private who has his first sexual experience with a prostitute known as Juicy Lucy. \u201cHywel Bennett\u2019s young Brigg appeals by grace of his close-set eyes, puddle brow and general air of queasiness,\u201d remarked the New York Times critic. Bennett was born in Garnant, Carmarthenshire, son of Gorden, a police officer, and Sarah Gwen (nee Lewis). When he was five, the family moved to London, where his brother, Alun (who became an actor under the name Alun Lewis), was born. At the age of 15, while attending Henry Thornton grammar school, Clapham, Bennett joined the National Youth Theatre. He played the female role of Ophelia in Hamlet (Queen\u2019s theatre, 1959) when it became the first amateur company to perform in Shaftesbury Avenue and was still casting only male actors, as in Shakespeare\u2019s time \u2013 a practice that changed shortly afterwards. He continued with the company for five years, his roles including Richmond in Richard III (Scala theatre, 1963). After a brief spell as a teacher, Bennett won a scholarship to train at Rada, then gained experience with rep theatre companies in Salisbury and Leatherhead in 1965. He continued to excel on stage in the classics, as Prince Hal in Henry IV, Parts I &amp; II (Mermaid theatre, 1970), Mark Antony in the National Theatre company\u2019s Young Vic production of Julius Caesar (1972), the lead in Hamlet on a 1974 South African tour, Marlow in She Stoops to Conquer (National Theatre at the Lyttelton theatre, 1984) and Andrey Prozorov in Three Sisters (Albery theatre, 1987). He also directed productions in provincial theatres. Bennett\u2019s movie career petered out with parts in sex comedies such as Percy (1971) and It\u2019s a Two-Foot-Six-Inch-Above-the-Ground World (1973, also known as Anyone for Sex?), although Loot (1970) gave him a starring role in the film version of Joe Orton\u2019s play and earned a screening at the Cannes film festival. \u201cI had come in at the tail end of everything, the studio system and so on,\u201d he told Bryan Appleyard in a 1986 interview. \u201cI found myself in the early 70s with nowhere to go.\u201d He took one-off character roles on television, then starred as the doctor planning to murder his wife in the four-part drama Malice Aforethought (1979) and played the field agent Ricki Tarr in Arthur Hopcraft\u2019s six-part adaptation of John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979), before Shelley made him a household name. There were also parts as the investigative journalist Allan Blakeston in Paula Milne\u2019s single drama Frankie and Johnnie (1986), Detective Sergeant Eddie Spader in the Stephen Poliakoff crime series Frontiers (1996) and the pompous assassin Mr Croup in the fantasy drama Neverwhere (1996), as well as a short run playing the gangland boss Jack Dalton (2003) in EastEnders. Bennett appeared in three Dennis Potter serials \u2013 as the pimp Tom in Pennies from Heaven (1978) and the sleazy club owner Arthur \u201cPig\u201d Mallion in both of the writer\u2019s final, linked works, Karaoke and Cold Lazarus (both in 1996). In 2007, he retired after being diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. Bennett is survived by his second wife, Sandra Layne Fulford, whom he married in 1998, and a daughter, Emma, from his marriage to McGowan, which ended in divorce. \u2022 Hywel Thomas Bennett, actor and director, born 8 April 1944; died 25 July 2017"
"23||Andrew Keogh obituaryMy friend Andrew Keogh, who has died of lung cancer aged 66, was a barrister, blogger, writer and political activist. He was called to the bar in 1978 and, starting out in law in London in the 1980s, was committed to the legal aid system and to resisting the then often transparent racism of the Brixton police. A friend recalls being astonished at how elegant Andrew looked in pinstripe suit, wig and gown. Andrew explained that \u201cif you\u2019re a poor, black kid being fitted up by the Brixton nick, that\u2019s how you want your brief to look\u201d. He joined No5 chambers, and became a widely respected jury advocate, known for his integrity and his willingness to devote time to helping younger members of his profession. He was also a writer, author of the longstanding White Rabbit blog, of two published novels, twentytwelve (2006), and The Killing Room (2013), and of the unfinished Diary of a Jobbing Barrister. Andrew was born in Leeds, son of Austin, a headteacher, and Hilda, a district nurse. He was brought up a Roman Catholic, and was educated at St Michael\u2019s college, a Catholic grammar school, but later converted to Anglicanism. He went on to the London School of Economics, where he studied political science and then law, and to the Inns of Court. Despite living and working in London, he thought of himself as a Yorkshireman, and was a loyal supporter of Leeds United and Yorkshire county cricket club. Probably cricket mattered the most to him: his parents had lived within easy walking distance of Headingley cricket ground and he regularly went with his father to watch both Yorkshire and England. He inherited a magnificent collection of Wisden from his father, which has now been bequeathed to his sons. He enjoyed Indian, Greek and Italian food, good wine, especially Malbec, and real ale, especially Young\u2019s bitter, marijuana, the novels of Evelyn Waugh, and the music of the Grateful Dead, New Riders of the Purple Sage and Bob Marley and the Wailers. As a student, Andrew had been active in the Young Liberals, serving as chairman of the Union of Liberal Students, and heavily involved in Anti-Apartheid Movement and the Stop the Seventies Tour campaign against South Africa. Later, he joined the International Socialists, the forerunner of the Socialist Workers party. Later still, he joined the Labour party and served on Lambeth council. More recently, he supported the Greens. What connected this itinerary \u2013 and also linked it to his vocation \u2013 was his belief in justice, both social and individual. Andrew is survived by two sons, Austin and Fintan, from his marriage to Sheila Jones, which ended in divorce, and three grandchildren, Dylan, Alyssa and Lily."
"19||Dow hits record high after US jobs report beats forecasts - as it happenedTime for a quick recap: America\u2019s economy has beaten expectations by creating 209,000 new jobs in July. An upbeat Non-Farm Payroll report also showed the jobless rate has fallen to 4.3%, while annual wage growth remained at 2.5%. The labor force participation rate picked up too. Here are the details Economists broadly welcomed the news. As Michael Pearce of Capital Economics put it: The real economy remains on a strong growth path at the start of the third quarter. If the labour market continues to tighten over the coming months, as the survey evidence suggests it will, the Fed will raise rates again later this year. Many of the new jobs were low-paid, though, while manufacturing continued to shrink as a share of the economy. Wall Street cheered the NFP report, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a new all-time high. Marcus Bullus, trading director of MB Capital, says: \u201cAfter seven straight record closes, the Dow\u2019s reaction to Friday\u2019s solid US jobs data has been balanced rather than breathless \u2013 with much of the cheerleading left to President Trump. \u201cBut nevertheless there\u2019s much to be reassured by in this comprehensively strong jobs print. \u201cYes the headline figures are impressive, both on the job creation and unemployment rate fronts. \u201cBut the details are arguably more important \u2013 the participation rate is creeping up as more Americans return to work, and average wages continue their solid upward progress. \u201cWith more Americans working, and more Americans earning more, the US\u2019s consumer-led growth remains firmly on track \u2013 powering equities into a sustained bull run. The dollar is also staging a recovery. It has now surged by 1% against the euro after hitting its lowest level since January 2015 this morning. Donald Trump welcomed the figures on Twitter (where else?....). And that\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The dollar is continuing to rebound strongly, putting worries about the Russian probe to one side. The greenback has hit a one-week high against the Japanese yen, at \u00a5110.99. It\u2019s also at a four-day high against the euro: Jameel Ahmad, VP of Corporate Research at FXTM, says today\u2019s jobs report has lifted the dollar. Those hoping that the US dollar would be thrown a lifeline may be in luck, following the news that the United States added another 209,000 jobs to its economy in July This is an overall positive employment report and highlights the underlying strength of the US labor market. Figures exceeded expectations, with earlier projections sitting at 183,000 and wage growth, with average earnings rising by an annualised 2.5%, being further good news for the US Dollar. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in New York. Wall Street traders piled into stocks as soon as the opening bell rang, following today\u2019s jobs report. This pushed the Dow up by 62 points, or 0.28%, to 22,088 points. Investors are encouraged by the news that America\u2019s economy created 209,000 new jobs last month, or almost 30,000 more than expected. The pick-up in monthly wage growth, from 0.2% to 0.3%, has also cheered the markets. Employment site site Indeed.com have sent over a handy chart, showing how many of these new jobs were relatively poorly paid... ....and another one showing how the US factory sector continued to shrink. Indeed Chief Economist Jed Kolko says: \u201cThis was a banner jobs report. With the strong payroll number in July, job growth in the past three months is ahead of the 2016 pace and way ahead of what\u2019s needed to keep up with population growth. Working-age adults are now more likely to be employed than at any time since the recession.\u201d \u201cAlthough wage growth remains stuck at 2.5%, the changing industry mix might be holding wage growth back. Low-wage industries grew fastest in July, led by leisure and hospitality. That\u2019s helping the least-educated Americans get back to work. The recovery is now strong and long enough to lift many of the people hurt most by the recession -- except in manufacturing, which continues to lag overall jobs growth.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s upbeat tweet failed to mention that the US labor market has been creating jobs steadily for years. Today\u2019s employment report is pretty robust, but it also extends a long trend of job creation and moderate wage growth. Ranko Berich of Monex Europe has tweeted this chart, showing monthly NFP figures (in blue) and the rolling average (in green). Berich adds that the dollar will probably remain under pressure, despite its rally in the last 50 minutes... \u201dThe move is not yet anywhere near large enough to suggest the greenback\u2019s relentless downwards trend of the last few weeks has been challenged.\u201d Erik Norland, Senior Economist at CME Group, has calculated that total pay growth remained steady in July. He writes: \u201cNon-farm payrolls grew by 209,000 in July, 29,000 better than consensus, while average hours earnings advanced by 2.5%, beating consensus by 0.1%. These numbers are very strong. Meanwhile unemployment fell back to its 17 year low of 4.3%. \u201cWhat this means is that total labour income in the US grew by 4.3%, very much consistent with its pace of growth since 2010. Here\u2019s our US business editor, Dominic Rushe, on today\u2019s US jobs report: The US economy added 209,000 new jobs in July \u2013 the second month in a row of 200,000 plus jobs growth. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, a 16-year low. Economists had forecast the US would add 180,000 jobs in July, in line with the average monthly gain for the last six months. The latest jobs news will come as a welcome relief for Donald Trump, who was elected on the promise of rebuilding the US jobs market. \u201cExcellent Jobs Numbers just released,\u201d the president tweeted, \u201cand I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!\u201d Ahead of the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the president heralded the announcement that Toyota and Mazda would soon be adding 4,000 new jobs at two new US plants. However, the jobs report showed once again that the majority of gains were in low-paying service industries. Jobs in food services and drinking places rose by 53,000 in July. The industry has added 313,000 jobs over the year. Healthcare employment increased by 39,000. Job growth in higher-paid sectors including construction, manufacturing and mining was marginal. Here\u2019s Dom\u2019s full story: President Donald Trump didn\u2019t waste any time in welcoming today\u2019s jobs figures, and taking credit for them too.... America\u2019s record-breaking run of job creation continued in July, points out economist Rupert Seggins: Alan Krueger, who chaired President Obama\u2019s council of economic advisors, says the NFP report doesn\u2019t contain any nasty surprises. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, he says: That\u2019s solid for the economy. It says the recovery is continuing at the same pace as before. Here\u2019s more details from the jobs report: Private sector jobs: Up by 205,000, compared with 194,000 in June Government jobs: Up by 4,000, compared with 37,000 in June Factory jobs: Up by 16,000, compared with 12,000 in June Goods-producing jobs: Up by 22,000 Construction jobs: Up by 6,000 Retail: Up by 900 Kully Samra, UK managing director at investment group Charles Schwab, says July\u2019s jobs report confirms the strength of the US economy. And that means the US central bank is likely to raise interest rates again before Christmas, Samra says. Sustained labour market strength will likely mean that the Federal Reserve remains on track to raise interest rates for a third time this year and announce a plan to start its balance sheet reduction plan, despite a recent ebb in inflation pressures. This healthy set of figures should bolster labour market buoyancy and goes some way to suggest that there is momentum in the economy to generate some inflation, even though price pressures still remain moderate. With US stocks drifting along near record highs, this latest jobs report bolsters our view that the US economy remains in robust shape as we continue in this long-term bull market.\u201d In another encouraging sign, America\u2019s labor force participation rate has risen to 62.9%, from 62.8%. That suggests that people are returning to the jobs market. On an annual basis, US earnings grew by 2.5% in July. That matches June\u2019s figures, and is a \u201cpretty solid\u201d result, according to James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute: The dollar is rallying back from this morning\u2019s lows, as traders welcome today\u2019s No-Farm Payroll report. This has sent the euro down 0.25% to $1.184, and the pound down to $1.311. Average earnings in the US economy grew by 0.3% in July, today\u2019s report shows, up from 0.2% in June. That\u2019s another encouraging sign, although workers might hope for stronger wage growth at this stage of the economic cycle. Breaking! America\u2019s economy created 209,000 new jobs last month. That\u2019s better than most economists had expected, and suggests the US labor market is still recovering. June\u2019s non-farm payroll has been revised higher too - to 231,000 jobs, from 222,00 originally. Plus....the unemployment rate has dropped to 4.3%, from 4.4%. More to follow... Tension is mounting in the markets ahead of the Non-Farm Payroll report. The US dollar is hovering at $1.1870 against the euro, close to this week\u2019s two and a half-year low. Forecasts for today\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll range from a modest 175,000 extra jobs to a robust 220,000. It\u2019s nearly time for the final major economic news of the week - America\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll for July. The NFP will tell us how many new jobs were created in the US last month (excluding hirings in the volatile agriculture sector), how much workers got paid, and whether people entered or left the labour market. Payroll forecasts vary widely, as it\u2019s quite a volatile measure (which is why financial types play a game of trying to guess the number each month, with limited success). Here\u2019s the consensus expectations for the data, due at 8.30am East Coast time or 1.30pm in London. NFP: Up by 183,000, compared with 222,000 in June Unemployment rate: Down to 4.3%, from 4.4% in June Average earnings (monthly): +0.3%, up from 0.2% in June. Although the job creation number may dominate the headlines, investors may be more interested in the wage growth figures. Earnings, and inflation, will determine how fast the US Federal Reserve can raise interest rates over the coming months. Kathleen Brooks of spreadbetting firm City Index explains: We believe that the wage component, which we do not forecast, will be the most important piece of data from the labour market report on Friday. If wages only rise by the expected 0.3% on the month, the annual rate is expected to weaken a touch to 2.4% from 2.5%, then it is hard to see how the dollar could stage a meaningful rally, as weak wage growth is likely to hinder the chances of a further rate hike from the Federal Reserve later this year. The US dollar\u2019s weakness, and general nervousness, is keeping the gold price near a seven-week high today. Bullion is changing hands at $1,268 per ounce, up slightly today, and close to the highest level since mid June. That means gold is on track to gain 1% this week, adding to the 2.2% increase in July. Warren Patterson, analyst at ING, says: (via Reuters): \u201cIts the same trend we\u2019ve seen for the last month. There\u2019s no change. Its mainly a dollar story.\u201d Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx predicts more pain for the dollar today, if July\u2019s jobs figures are a disappointment. He writes: Analysts are expecting the headline non-farm figure to shrink from 222k [new jobs] to 182k month-on-month, but with the unemployment rate falling back to 4.3%. Wage growth, meanwhile, is set to remain rather flaccid, with forecasts of a 0.3% increase in July compared to the 0.2% jump in June. If accurate \u2013 and remember, those non-farm estimates have a tendency to be way off base \u2013 it could be another difficult day for the dollar, continuing the currency\u2019s summer from hell. Plus, of course, we could see more revelations around the Russia inquiry. Any suggestion that the situation is becoming more serious for the White House would probably spook the markets. The US dollar is on track for its fourth weekly loss in a row, unless today\u2019s jobs data is strong enough to spark a rally. Bloomberg says: The dollar index is headed for a fourth straight weekly decline after yesterday\u2019s report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a federal grand jury in Washington to help his probe into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion. Investors shouldn\u2019t panic over the news that the UK government is reviewing Help to Buy, says Anthony Codling of Jeffries. Codling reckons the scheme will simply be tweaked, to encourage more smaller homes to be built, rather than sunk altogether. There is speculation in Property Week that the UK Government is seeking to scale back Help to Buy. Our view is that the Government will do nothing which could lead to a reduction in housebuilding volumes. We believe that around two thirds of Help to Buy sales did not need help to buy, rather homebuyers used the scheme to purchase a bigger home. Focusing Help to Buy on First Time Buyers who need it is sensible, in our view. Housebuilders may need to build more 3 bed homes and fewer 5 bed ones, but, in our view, such a change in density may lead to a rise rather than a fall in housebuilder returns. There\u2019s a subdued mood in Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning, with the main indices broadly flat. Investors seem to be keeping to the sidelines until the US jobs report has landed. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says: The exuberance of yesterday appears to have been left behind this morning, with the FTSE retreating into a risk-conscious period of consolidation, given the unpredictability ahead of us. UK housebuilders are having a particularly bad, following a report that the government could end its \u2018Help To Buy\u2019 scheme early. Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Development are all down 3.5%, even though the government has denied that the scheme - which helps first-time buyers - is being wrapped up. The US dollar continues to bob around a 15-month low, as traders get ready for the US jobs report in three hours time. Concerns over the US political situation continues to weigh on the dollar. Commerzbank strategists explained to clients this morning that: \u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that the greenback is ...suffering as a result of President Trump\u2019s weak government --the situation in the White House is simply too chaotic. \u201cThat means any hopes that arose after the elections andresulted in a sharp rise in inflation expectations have sincebeen dashed.\u201d The drop in car sales last month shows that consumers are struggling, says Howard Archer, chief economist at the EY Item Club: Sky News\u2019s economics editor Ed Conway is also concerned: Noble Francis, economics director of the Construction Products Association, fears that the slowdown in car sales could signal a wider weakness in the economy: Breaking! UK car sales fell over 9% in July, for the fourth month in a row. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders blamed Brexit uncertainty for the decline, and is urging the government to provide clarity over its plans. According to the SMMT, 161,997 new cars were registered in the month as the market continues to fall. Car sales to businesses slumped by 23.8% year on year, while fleet sales were down 10% and registrations to private buyers fell by 6.8%. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says the auto industry desperately needs to know what Brexit deal Britain is aiming for: The fall in consumer and business confidence is having a knock on effect on demand in the new car market and government must act quickly to provide concrete plans regarding Brexit. Diesel sales declined by 20%, following the recent emission scandal, while sales of alternatively fuelled vehicles, such as electric cars, surged by almost 65%. Hawes explains: While it\u2019s encouraging to see record achievements for alternatively fuelled vehicles, consumers considering other fuel types will have undoubtedly been affected by the uncertainty surrounding the government\u2019s clean air plans. Today\u2019s dollar weakness is part of a broader trend. The greenback has lost around 10% of its value since January, as optimism that Donald Trump might achieve tax reforms and infrastructure spending have faded. This chart, from CNN, shows how the US currency has had a rocky ride as investors lost faith, or patience, with the president. CNN says: The \u201cWhite House soap opera\u201d has fueled the dollar\u2019s decline, according to Kit Juckes, a macro strategist at Societe Generale. \u201cConfidence in the U.S. administration\u2019s ability to deliver growth-boosting fiscal policies is at rock bottom,\u201d Juckes wrote in a report this week. More here: The UK economy is \u201ca little bit\u201d better placed to withstand a small rise in interest rates according to Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor of the Bank of England. Broadbent has been speaking a day after the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee left rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.25% and downgraded UK growth forecasts. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cWe have got to recognise that changes in interest rates take time. We can\u2019t look just at what is happening now, we have to look at what might happen in the medium term. \u201cWe think that the economy will continue to grow, we think that wage growth will pick up. I think there may be some possibility for interest rates to go up a little bit.\u201d Broadbent suggested there was light at the end of the tunnel for cash-strapped consumers, whose incomes are being squeezed as prices rise faster than wages: \u201cWe think inflation will peak in the second half of this year. We expect... wage growth over the next three years.\u201d It\u2019s a dark morning for staff at educational publisher Pearson, as it announces plans to cut another 3,000 jobs.... Back in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland has revealed it is planning to create a new hub in Amsterdam, to help it cope with Brexit. Shares in the taxpayer-owned bank have jumped by over 4% this morning, after it also announced it made a profit of almost \u00a31bn in the last six month. Maybe the worst of over for RBS (although a likely fine from US regulators over its conduct before the financial crisis still looms...) The US dollar could weaken further today, if July\u2019s American employment report fails to meet expectations. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga believes it will take something special to shake off the grand jury news. It has been another rough and rocky trading week for the Greenback as heightened political jitters in Washington weighed heavily on the currency.... The distressed Dollar is in need of a lifeline and it may take an extreme upside surprise in both headline job numbers and earnings to bring the bulls back into the game. The US dollar is under pressure this morning, after it emerged that a grand jury has been convened to examine that Russia meddled in the US presidential election. The dollar is languishing at a 15-month low this morning, and is close to its lowest level against the euro in over two years. Reuters reports: The dollar hovered near the 2-1/2-year-low against the euro touched earlier this week, pressured by signs that probes into possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections are gathering pace. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says there is \u201cunrelenting US dollar weakness\u201d right now. And Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York, says: \u201c(Political) policy uncertainty in the U.S. I think has been the biggest driver of declines in the dollar recently. \u201cAny positive effect from the election of President Trump I think at this point has been priced out. This comes after US media reported that special prosecutor Robert Mueller had set up the grand jury, as part of his inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. President Trump hit back last night, telling his supporters that there was a plot to \u201ccheat\u201d them out of his leadership.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. America\u2019s economy is in the spotlight today as we find out how many new jobs were created in the US last month. July\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that the US unemployment rate dipped back to 4.3% last month, with around 183,000 new jobs created. The earnings figures will be closely watched too. They may show that wages rose by 0.3% during the month, up from June\u2019s disappointing 0.2%. Although the Non-Farm Payroll is frequently revised, it is a good insight into the health of the world\u2019s largest economy. President Donald Trump famously promised to be \u201cthe greatest jobs president that God ever created.\u201d This might not be the first thing the history books remember him for, but today\u2019s figures could show if he\u2019s delivering on that pledge. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, expects a strong report: \u201cOur models point to an above-consensus gain of 200,000 or better in July. This aligns well with the quick job creation in June and other measures of labour market health that abound in the U.S. However, we are aware that there is a slight undercurrent of decelerating job creation over the past few years that will probably extend on a trend basis into the future \u2013 a natural function of an aging cycle.\u201d The US economy created jobs steadily under president Obama\u2019s watch, as this chart reminds us: In the City, Royal Bank of Scotland, publishing group Pearson and theme park operator Merlin Entertainment are all reporting results.

"8||British husband appeals to Foreign Office to help free wife in Iranian jailThe British husband of a woman imprisoned in an Iranian jail has appealed to the Foreign Office to raise her case during a visit to Tehran this week. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who holds British and Iranian passports, has decorated her cell with pictures from her infant daughter after being sentenced to five years in jail on secret charges last year, her husband told the Guardian. Richard Ratcliffe, an accountant who lives in north London, hopes that the Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt will hold talks with senior Iranian politicians about the 38-year-old charity worker, who was arrested in April last year. Burt is meeting Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s family and is due to attend the official swearing-in ceremony for the re-elected president, Hassan Rouhani, on Saturday. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested during a trip to Iran with her daughter, Gabriella, to visit family members. The daughter, who is now three, had her passport confiscated before it was returned. She is living with her grandparents in Iran and is allowed to see her mother twice a week. Ratcliffe, 42, said his wife was finding the separation from her daughter especially difficult. He said he hoped Burt would insist on Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s rights as a British and Iranian passport holder. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the quirks of the law and UK policy about dual nationality,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cNazanin lives in Britain, she is British, her job\u2019s here, her home is here. She is being held in part, or mainly, because she is British. The way in which you can\u2019t do anything about it because she is Iranian seems so counter-intuitive.\u201d Ratcliffe has been campaigning for his wife\u2019s release since she was arrested at Tehran airport as she tried to leave the country at the end of her visit. She was accused of trying to topple the Iranian regime. \u201cIran hides behind dual nationality,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cThe reason they don\u2019t allow the British ambassador access to her is because, \u2018Oh, she is Iranian,\u2019 which is a fiction, because the reason they took her is because she is British.\u201d Ratcliffe has applied for an Iranian visa and is hoping to visit Gabriella and Zaghari-Ratcliffe. \u201cI have promised Nazanin I won\u2019t do anything with Gabriella without her agreement, because of course the only thing Nazanin lives for at the moment is visits from her daughter. That is the worst thing at the moment, missing these months with her daughter. Nazanin has covered the walls of her cell with pictures drawn by Gabriella during the visits.\u201d Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been imprisoned at Evin jail for several months and is suffering from mental health problems, as well as physical issues with her shoulder, neck, eyesight and teeth. Ratcliffe said he had recently had a meeting with Burt, and hoped he would raise the issue during the visit. Labour MPs have criticised the lack of progress. \u201cHe was kind,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cIt feels like he cares. I do have a dispute with the Foreign Office that they are not pushing hard enough, and I have made that clear all along, but I do not doubt that he cares.\u201d Ratcliffe said he remained hopeful that his wife would be released but said Foreign Office involvement would be critical. \u201cThe Foreign Office are never optimistic,\u201d said Ratcliffe. \u201cThey are just guarded.\u201d Zaghari-Ratcliffe is not the only British-Iranian citizen in an Iranian prison. Kamal Foroughi, 77, is being held for alleged espionage. Both Foroughi and Zaghari-Ratcliffe have maintained their innocence. Ahead of his trip, Burt said the UK was \u201ckeen to maintain dialogue\u201d on issues including the detainees. He said: \u201cWe hope to build further on improving UK-Iran relations during President Rouhani\u2019s second term. \u201cThe president\u2019s personal commitment to the nuclear deal is welcome and it is vital both our countries work closely together to ensure the deal continues to be successfully implemented. \u201cWe are also keen to maintain dialogue on Iran\u2019s regional policies, human rights and particularly our dual national detainees. Progress in all of these areas is important to the UK.\u201d"
"8||The impact of affirmative action at the University of California in one graphicGovernment documents on Wednesday revealed that the US justice department is planning to investigate and possibly sue universities based on their affirmative action policies. As president, Donald Trump may be trying to appeal to the 56% of Americans who said they think it\u2019s likely \u201ca white person won\u2019t get a job or promotion while an equally or less qualified black person gets one instead\u201d, according to a General Social Survey (GSS) from the University of Chicago. A lot of the polling on affirmative action is unsurprising. White Americans are consistently less likely than non-white Americans to support policies that attempt to address discrimination. But the polling is often flawed because it uses biased language in questions. One example (also in the GSS) asked Americans whether they believe blacks should overcome prejudice without \u201cspecial favors\u201d. Affirmative action is not a \u201cspecial favor\u201d. It is a measure aimed at bridging the gap between the best universities in the country that remain largely comprised of whites and the rest of the country that increasingly isn\u2019t. Several states have banned affirmative action programs in the past. This happened in California in 1998, and when it did, black and Hispanic enrollment at the University of California, Berkeley fell from 24% to just 13%. Now over half of college-age Californians are black or hispanic but only 15% of Berkeley\u2019s freshmen is black or Hispanic. The graphic above, inspired by one created by The New York Times in 2013, has been updated with more recent data. You can view more details about the numbers here."
"6||Give us a paintbrush! Ten ways to make the housing market work for tenantsPolitical parties, aware that tenants are a sizeable voting block, are vying to be seen to mend the UK\u2019s undeniably broken housing market. Housing and planning minister Alok Sharma supports building more homes for private rent, offering three-year, family-friendly tenancies at \u201caffordable\u201d rents. That\u2019s reasonable, of course \u2013 although of little help to those already suffering in the rental market. At last week\u2019s AGM of Living Rent (Scotland\u2019s tenants\u2019 union), everybody listened to stirring tales of defeating bad landlords, before splitting into groups to plan the next campaign. The resulting wish-list was simple. This is what we\u2019d like: 1 Rent controls Letting agents insist on big rent increases, not because of improvements, but because that\u2019s what they do. It\u2019s especially galling to see rents rising when interest rates are low, but Scotland has a new law conferring power to restrain greed with \u201crent pressure zones\u201d, which cap rent increases across an area (and includes social tenants). Tenants across the UK need similar powers. 2 Don\u2019t link rents to inflation No above-inflation rises sounds like another workable solution to rocketing costs. But an older Living Rent member recalled the days of 20% inflation. If our economy stumbles (make that when) rents tied to escalating inflation could cripple tenants who, especially in London, pay up to 75% of their incomes on housing. 3 Include tenants in policy discussions Living Rent was formed after an eagle-eyed renter realised landlords had organised and were lobbying Holyrood for new rules detrimental to tenants. They demanded a place at the policy debating table, and Scotland now has legislation helpful to tenants. Lobbying works. 4 Longer rental periods But how long should these new miracle tenancies last? Well, how about for ever? Or at least until we choose to leave. Life for tenants is paved with eggshells. We step carefully, accepting notice issued for no reason, trivial causes or just \u2026 because. When renewal time comes around, we hold our nerve while exploitative letting agents sense our fear and whack up the rent. Scotland\u2019s Private Housing (Tenancies) Act 2016 enacts the assumption we can stay for ever. Over to you, England and Wales. 5 Let tenants decorate I am bored with requesting decoration rights, but I am going to repeat myself nonetheless. It used to be that tenants were given one week rent free if they painted, thereby avoiding the tyranny of magnolia sensory deprivation tanks. Let us paint as they do in Germany, where at the end of a long tenancy, it is incumbent upon renters to put the property back as it was. But hey, in the interim we get to splash colour around until it\u2019s like the world turning Technicolor in The Wizard of Oz, albeit after the judicious consultation of paint charts. 6 Ban furnished flats Controversial maybe, but furniture provided by landlords is often bizarre. Three precarious chairs around a rickety four-seater table, temperamental fridges, soggy cushions, sticky sofas, cracked lino and carpets with mysterious stains. Unfurnished is more expensive but, with a proper culture of genuinely affordable upcycling enabling tenants to acquire a few essentials, we can do this. 7 Professionalise landlords Property investment must be seen as a business, not a hobby. Tenants pay rent, and do not occupy a house as a favour or a gift; we pay for the privilege. Most landlords own one rental property, and have no knowledge of rules, best practice or how to be, well, nice. So train them up and make them better. 8 Recognise tenants\u2019 unions Negotiate with Living Rent in Scotland, Acorn and Generation Rent in England and Wales. If renting policy is discussed, do not immediately and unquestioningly adopt any crazy notion from the powerful landlord lobby. Current renting policy is subject to landlords\u2019 whims and fancies. Many MPs and MSPs are rentiers, which should be declared as an interest when debating policies that affect the lives of tenants. 9 Energy efficiency is vital It\u2019s not enough to colour-code appliances to indicate how much energy they devour. Tenants need powers to enforce replacements if appliances are inefficient. 10 Good, old-fashioned revenge One speaker at the AGM semi-jokingly demanded the right to inspect a landlord or letting agent\u2019s home or premises to give them a taste of their own medicine, meandering snootily around taking pictures of curtains, wearing high heels on laminate floors then leaving instructions on how to deal with damp and mould when you\u2019ve been doing just that for the past five years (this happens to me every three months or so). Ah, sweet revenge. And it might actually encourage landlords to treat us with more respect. \u2022 Penny Anderson is a writer and artist"
"1||Stan Wawrinka to miss US Open title defence and rest of 2017 seasonStan Wawrinka will not defend his US Open title and will miss the rest of the season after deciding to undergo surgery on his left knee. The 32-year-old was troubled by the problem during his first-round loss to Daniil Medvedev at Wimbledon and revealed earlier this week he would miss the Masters events in Montreal and Cincinnati. Wawrinka, however, has since made the decision to take direct action in a bid to resolve the problem. He said in a statement: \u201cI am sad to announce that, after talking with my team and doctor, I had to make a difficult decision to undergo a medical intervention on my knee. This was the only solution to make sure I will be able to compete at the top level for many more years.\u201d Wawrinka won his third grand slam title in New York last year with victory over Novak Djokovic. Neither will be at Flushing Meadows this year, with Djokovic also calling an early end to his season to rest an elbow problem that forced him to retire during his Wimbledon quarter-final against Tomas Berdych. It remains to be seen whether Andy Murray will be fit enough to compete as he continues his recovery from a hip problem. The world No1 has withdrawn from next week\u2019s Rogers Cup in Montreal but has not yet announced whether he will play the following week in Cincinnati or at the US Open. Continuing his statement, Wawrinka said: \u201cThis is obviously extremely disappointing but I\u2019m already looking ahead and planning my recovery. I love this sport and I will work hard to get back to my top level and play many more years.\u201d Wawrinka has been replaced in the US Open draw by Germany\u2019s Florian Mayer."
"2||Jack Jeffery obituaryMy father, Jack Jeffery, who has died aged 87, was a chemist and water purity expert who came from a family strongly rooted in pacifism, secularism and socialism. He taught his children the value of strong opinions and vigorous debate. The only child of Philip Jeffery, a plasterer and school caretaker, and his wife, Elsie (nee Carr), he was born and brought up in Clough Dene, a hamlet in Co Durham. Jack shared his father\u2019s passions for literature and cricket. He played the piano from the age of 11. When he was 18, he saw Duke Ellington at the City Hall in Newcastle. Later, wherever he went, Jack sought out live jazz \u2013 a conference in Stockholm was once eclipsed by the chance to see Woody Herman and his Herd. After attending Alderman Wood school (later Stanley grammar school), he did his national service in the RAF and met Mavis Carroll, a Waaf radar operator. They married in 1950, and Jack began his first year at King\u2019s College, now Newcastle University, reading chemistry and bacteriology. I was born in 1951, followed by Carole in 1953 and Jill in 1958. Jack\u2019s first job was with the National Coal Board as a chemist at Dunstable Coke Works. He examined the potential for using bacteria to break down chemical effluents in the coking process. The result was a significant improvement to the water quality of the River Wear. He combined his work with studying for a master\u2019s degree from Durham University. In 1961 Jack was appointed to the South West Suburban Water Company as its first chemist. We moved to Ashford, Middlesex, and he joined Laleham Cricket Club, playing for the first team for 13 years. He chaired the Water Companies Association and became well known internationally in the field of water quality; he led the negotiations on behalf of the statutory companies when the industry was privatised. In 1983 he and Mavis divorced, and he married Deborah Hyde. They had a long and loving marriage, in the company of various rescue basset hounds. Jack became master of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers in 1995 and was appointed CBE the same year. He was chair of the World Humanity Action Trust in 2000, and was in large part responsible for its report Governance for a Sustainable Future, which he presented to the UN in New York in the same year. He was vice-chair of the British Humanist Association, and in 2009 chaired the International Humanist Conference in Uganda. He was a loyal friend and an unwavering supporter of Sunderland Football Club. After Deborah\u2019s death in 2009 he married Gillian Mason, an old friend. He is survived by Gillian, by Carole, Jill and me, and by four grandchildren."
"14||Man accused of murder during sex session challenged over 'no memory' claimA convicted killer, caught on camera smothering a computer repair technician in a bondage sex session, has been challenged over his claim that he cannot remember the latest killing with which he is charged. Jason Marshall allegedly stole \u00a3780 in cash from Peter Fasoli, 58, and used his bank card to buy a ticket to Rome after attacking him in his home in Northolt, north-west London, in January 2013, the Old Bailey has heard. Marshall, of East Ham, denies murder. While on the run in Italy the 28-year-old murdered a second victim and tried to kill a third, the court heard. He was convicted by an Italian court of murder and attempted murder. He was sent back to Britain this year and charged with Fasoli\u2019s murder. For nearly two years, Fasoli\u2019s death was put down to an accident until his nephew stumbled across the footage of his violent death on his hard drive, the court previously heard. Marshall dressed up as a police officer and claimed to be an MI5 agent as he committed the alleged murder, the court heard. On Friday he was played extracts of the CCTV footage from the flat of Fasoli\u2019s last hours, during which he was smothered. In his defence, Marshall has claimed he cannot remember the entire period spanning the killings. Cross-examining on Friday, Edward Brown QC, prosecuting, said Marshall told a different story in his earlier Italian trial, which led to his conviction. He said: \u201cWhat you did not say to the court was that you could not remember. Yesterday you claimed on oath that you could not remember a thing from the time you were partying with your family in England to the time you woke up in an Italian hospital.\u201d Marshall said the truth was he could not remember what had happened but his lawyer in Italy had urged him to \u201ccome up with something better\u201d. In the Italian trial, the court heard, he had never made any reference to amnesia. Earlier in the trial, Brown told jurors that less than three weeks after Fasoli\u2019s death Marshall had murdered Vincenzo Iale in his flat in Rome. Italian investigators found that Marshall had met 67-year-old Iale, a Badoo user, and strangled him with an electrical flex. Just over a week later, Marshall, posing as \u201cGabriel\u201d, contacted Umberto Gismondi on Badoo and they arranged to meet for sex. When Gismondi, 54, invited him to his Rome flat, Marshall pretended he worked at the British embassy and bound and attacked him with a truncheon and pepper spray and tried to smother him with a cushion. Marshall fled when Gismondi alerted his neighbours, but was arrested later, jurors were told. The court on Friday heard how in the Italian trial Marshall blamed a person called \u201cMichael\u201d for Iale\u2019s death and claimed Gismondi had attacked him. Brown told Marshall he could not \u201chide behind drink and drugs\u201d in the Italian case because Gismondi had survived. He went on: \u201cThere is a really important fundamental difference, Mr Marshall, from the evidence that was able to be presented to the Italian courts and the evidence at the Old Bailey and that is the CCTV. You just cannot get away from it can you?\u201d Marshall retorted: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to get away from it.\u201d Brown said: \u201cWith respect you have got two choices given the strength of that unassailable material. You can say \u2018yes I did intend to kill Mr Fasoli\u2019, or you can say \u2018I cannot remember\u2019.\u201d The defendant said: \u201cDon\u2019t you think I would come up with a better excuse than I can\u2019t remember?\u201d The lawyer replied: \u201cThat is the point. There is nowhere else for you to go given that CCTV material.\u201d Marshall was played the CCTV in the courtroom. The defendant said Fasoli, who he met on gay dating site Badoo, might have had a \u201cdesire to be dominated\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not all about me.\u201d Brown said: \u201cIt\u2019s plain later, this is nothing to do with enjoyment.\u201d The trial was adjourned to Monday when it will continue."
"24||I don\u2019t want to leave my husband but I feel suffocated and am having an affairI\u2019ve been with my husband for eight years and we have been married for three. We are in our mid-30s and still haven\u2019t decided if we want to have children. I am more hesitant than him. I have left my home country, family and friends to live with him. While it was extremely tough at the beginning, I feel I have now built something nice \u2013 a good job, a house, all in all a very convenient life. My husband is a very sensitive, good-natured person. He has mental health problems and we have been through some very difficult times in the past. He is now stabilised, but I still wonder if the illness could come back and how I would be able to cope with it \u2013 especially if we have a child, and no family support. I have been seeing a psychoanalyst and it has helped me understand why I am so undecided. But unfortunately, despite the work I have been doing, from time to time I still get a feeling of suffocating with him, and I want to run away. I feel that I chose my husband for the wrong reasons and that our relationship feels more like one between mother and son than between equals. I still don\u2019t know if this can change, or if it is better to change partners and choose more wisely next time. The crises I\u2019m going through \u2013 maybe one every few months \u2013 affect my husband a lot and I can see how much I hurt him. I want him to be happy and stop making him suffer, and sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m the right person for him. I have had an affair with an extremely handsome man who is also very ambitious, self-confident and successful \u2013 quite the opposite of my husband \u2013 and it was exhilarating. The affair might continue. I\u2019m not sure yet, but I\u2019m definitely open. Which should be my life from now on: not leaving my husband because I\u2019m scared of what\u2019s next; leaving my rather nice, if not exciting, life, and the benefits of an affair now and then \u2013 if the opportunity arises, I won\u2019t be actively looking for it I think; or motherhood; or starting all over again and moving back home? When I first got your letter I almost put it to one side for a few weeks as I thought it was too similar to a recent one \u2013 \u201cshould I have a second baby?\u201d. You asked in your longer letter whether having a baby will \u201ccalm you down\u201d. But then I realised that this really isn\u2019t about a baby but about your marriage. You cannot have a baby to cement a marriage. You may have a baby with this man, but that\u2019s a way down the line, when you have first sorted out your relationship issues. It\u2019s interesting how you put the bit about the affair almost at the end of your letter, as an afterthought. Unless your husband knows about this and you have an arrangement (and I offer no judgment for such arrangements \u2013 they can work very well if all parties are in agreement), then this really is the nub of your problem. I consulted Stefan Walters, a couples therapist. \u201cYou sound lost and fearful, and it is fear which is keeping you trapped,\u201d he says. \u201cThis presents as a problem about having a baby but it\u2019s really not that, you sum it up when you say: \u2018I feel I chose my husband for the wrong reasons.\u2019\u201d Walters also says you are \u201cdoing a lot of predictive thinking\u201d. In other words, you are imagining a lot of what your husband may be thinking or what he may say. \u201cWhy not let him answer for himself?\u201d he asks. We guess that, perhaps, the reason you can\u2019t talk honestly to your husband is because of your affair. \u201cInstead of talking,\u201d says Walters, \u201cyou have retreated and are having an affair. An affair is often not about getting away from your partner, but the person you think you\u2019re becoming. You are trying to escape your own narrative.\u201d I thought this was astute and a sentence you should linger over. Walters reiterates that having a baby is \u201cnot a fix [for your marriage], and it is never a good idea to make a decision out of fear\u201d. While it\u2019s great you are going to therapy, Walters says you both need to go to couples therapy. I asked him how you might broach the subject of your unhappiness. \u201cCome at it from a place of vulnerability, not aggression. If you are aggressive, it will make him defensive,\u201d he says. \u201cTry to name some of the emotions you are feeling, so don\u2019t blame, but say something like: \u2018I\u2019m scared about the future, I have these insecurities.\u2019 Ask him how he feels.\u201d \u201cOn some level,\u201d says Walters, \u201cyour husband will probably already know how you feel, so a conversation may come as a relief.\u201d There were some contradictions in your letter: detachment, clarity, feeling like the adult but also sounding immature. \u201cYou seem to lack ownership in some of your choices,\u201d says Walters. \u201cIf you always put yourself in the role of parent, your husband has no choice but to be the child. Why don\u2019t you allow yourself to be cared for for a change?\u201d If you don\u2019t communicate how you feel, any other long-term relationship you undertake may also suffer from this lack of intimacy (remember intimacy is not about sex necessarily, but about communication), and you may come up feeling exactly the same in a few years\u2019 time.

"24||Fancy a life swap with Donald Trump? No, thanksOne of the minor upsides of having to devote any brain-space to the Trump family is how vividly they demonstrate that an ultra-luxury lifestyle doesn\u2019t lead to happiness. We\u2019re all at least a little susceptible, I take it, to society\u2019s message that celebrities\u2019 lives are to be envied, leaving us feeling vaguely dissatisfied with our own. But I can state confidently there isn\u2019t a shred of me that wants to swap existences with Donald, Ivanka, Don Jr or the others. In showing how easily the extremes of wealth, fame and power can coexist with the bored and angry restlessness they exude, they\u2019re doing us a huge favour. There\u2019s nothing like contemplating Trump in his bathrobe, distractedly watching Fox in a gold-encrusted Mar-a-Lago bedroom suite, to make you appreciate your cramped flat and non-celebrity life. Then again, as the philosopher Todd May explained in a recent New York Times essay, this notion of wanting someone else\u2019s life \u2013 even the life of some truly admirable, non-famous person \u2013 is exceedingly odd, once you think about it carefully. Taken literally, it would mean not only acquiring that person\u2019s circumstances, but also surrendering your own. \u201cMy relationships with everyone \u2013 children, spouse, friends \u2013 and my whole history\u201d would all need to be jettisoned, May writes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have undergone it. My loss would be that of the whole of my own experience.\u201d Perhaps a few people have had lives so terrible they\u2019d make that trade. But most of us don\u2019t feel that way, even about the bad times \u2013 perhaps least of all about the bad times, which we tend to conclude are what made us who we are: \u201cWe want to have been there ourselves, even though it was not a joyous experience for us.\u201d This, deep down, is the strangely self-hating implication of our culture of celebrity envy: not only that their gleaming lives would be fun, but that they\u2019d be worth completely relinquishing our own for. You might object that only a philosopher would take the idea of life-swapping literally. Obviously, when the rest of us say we\u2019d like someone else\u2019s life, we simply mean we\u2019d like various things we don\u2019t have, whether that\u2019s things like money and fame, or things like stronger relationships and more fulfilling work. Yes, but even this poses a problem. Because where do those desires come from? From our unique personal histories, which have made us who we are. The very fact of your daydreaming about a radically different life is a product of your own. The whole thing threatens to collapse into paradox: your view of someone else\u2019s circumstances as more appealing arises from a perspective shaped entirely by your own interests and values. If you actually did have that person\u2019s possessions, relationships and status, you\u2019d be someone else. And who\u2019s to say you\u2019d share those interests and values? You\u2019d probably just be envious of someone else. The grass is always greener at a distance. Which, come to think of it, is maybe why Trump seems to be spending his presidency on a never-ending tour of golf courses. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"
"2||Industrial meat production is killing our seas. It's time to change our dietsEvery spring, as the snows thaw, water rushes down the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, spreading life, then death into the Gulf of Mexico. The floodwaters are laden with fertilisers washed from fields and factory farms. As spring turns to summer, excessive nutrients first drive a huge bloom of living plankton, then cause death on a gargantuan scale as a dead zone blossoms across the seabed. Most years it grows swiftly to over 5,000 square miles of seabed, killing everything that cannot outrun it. This year\u2019s dead zone has engulfed 8,700 square miles, the biggest ever recorded. A new report lands much of the blame for the dead zone at the door of modern industrial agriculture. America\u2019s addiction to cheap meat, fed on corn and soy in vast indoor factories, comes at a high cost in human health problems and environmental destruction. None of these costs are paid for by the companies that produce the meat and feed, such as Tyson, Cargill and ADM. Agriculture was very different before the second world war, when animals were mostly kept outdoors. Cows grazed on pasture and rangeland, while chickens and hogs rooted over fields, supplemented with food and crop waste. Chemicals were little used. In the last few decades, meat production has intensified and become big business for the agrochemical industry. Animals have been moved indoors into crowded feedlots where they are fattened on corn and soybeans grown, ironically, on the rangeland the animals vacated. Cropland is eating into the remaining prairie, making this wildflower rich habitat one of the most endangered in the US. Crops grown to supply meat production consume vast quantities of fertilisers, herbicides, fungicides and pesticides, much of which wash into streams and rivers, and then downstream to the sea. Indoor animals are pumped full of veterinary drugs to counter the disease risks of high-density living. The drugs find their way into watercourses from urine, manure and abattoir waste. Plankton, the microscopic plants and animals that drift in the open sea, fuel ocean food webs. Normally, they are limited by lack of nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, the key ingredients of farm fertiliser. But in certain parts of the sea, nutrients, light and warmth come together in just the right quantities. One such area was the \u201cfertile crescent\u201d, an area west of the Mississippi Delta, once famed for its abundant marine life and prolific fisheries for fish and shrimp. But agricultural pollution has destroyed it. The Mississippi drains 40% of the lower 48 states, including much of the midwest agricultural belt. Corn and soybeans for industrial meat production produce half the nitrogen and a quarter of the phosphorus pollution reaching the Gulf of Mexico. So much fertiliser washes into the Gulf today that the planktonic explosion of life is excessive. Come summer, the short-lived plankton die and sink and their rotting bodies suck up all the oxygen dissolved in the water. The deathly shroud kills indiscriminately. There are more than 550 dead zones across the world today, the great majority due to agricultural and industrial pollution. Meat consumption is growing fast, encouraged by low prices that do not reflect the true costs. As Philip Lymbery argues in his compelling book, Dead Zone: Where the Wild Things Were, if the costs of pollution, habitat destruction, losses to fisheries and tourism, climate change and impacts on human health were fully accounted for, meat would be a luxury food. Industrial agriculture and our diets must change if the world is to prosper. By eating more vegetables and less meat, reared outdoors in humane and sustainable ways, we would all be better off."
"7||Is Wolves\u2019 record signing R\u00faben Neves really suited to the Championship?For a 20-year-old, R\u00faben Neves has broken a good few records. He finished coolly on his debut as a 17-year-old to become Porto\u2019s youngest league scorer. He surpassed Cristiano Ronaldo as the youngest Portuguese player to appear in the Champions League. At 18, he became the youngest captain in the history of the same competition, leading Porto to victory over Maccabi Tel Aviv. On Saturday he looks likely to anchor the midfield for Wolves as they host Middlesbrough in the Championship. The \u00a315.8m Wolves paid to bring Neves to the Black Country is another record, the biggest transfer fee in the history of the Championship. Since the deal was agreed it has raised questions: about the club\u2019s ambitions under the Chinese owners Fosun (owners closely advised by Neves\u2019s agent, Jorge Mendes), the competitive status of the division and what the transfer says about Neves\u2019s ability. In his three seasons as a professional, Neves has managed to squeeze in not only a rapid rise but a stark decline. A local boy who had been on Porto\u2019s books since the age of eight, Neves was plucked out of the youth system by Julen Lopetegui, now Spain\u2019s national coach. It is easy to understand why. An instinctive reader of the game, Neves\u2019s key strength is his ability to make interceptions, backed up with a strong tackle. In his breakthrough season, over-the-top comparisons flew thick and fast but one, describing him as the new Sergio Busquets, carried more weight as it came from his team-mate Cristian Tello, himself a product of Barcelona\u2019s La Masia academy. Neves has more than that in his locker though. Technically adept, he can break up play as well as drive it back down the other end of the pitch. He can pick out a crossfield pass from either flank. He takes up smart positions in and around the box that make him a great option for long-range shooting opportunities. But Neves has scored only twice since that goal on his debut. The two full caps he earned as an 18-year-old (in friendlies against Russia and Luxembourg) have not been followed up and his chances to shine at junior level have been and gone. He made six starts in the league last year, a season whose tone was set when Neves burst into tears on the Porto bench after his coach had decided not to use him during a Champions League qualifier with Roma. That coach was Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, now the manager of Wolves. Nuno has had an itinerant career (he lasted a season at Porto) and is perhaps most famous for being the first client signed to the books of Mendes. The world\u2019s most powerful agent, Mendes is a business associate of the Fosun Group and is believed to have advised it to plump for Wolves when the company was first looking to invest in football to support the Chinese government\u2019s latter-day enthusiasm for the game. Mendes, through his company Gestifute, represents Neves and four other players on Wolves\u2019 books. Between them they have cost the club about \u00a332m in transfer fees. There are questions as to whether Mendes is directing undue influence over the transfer policy and to whether these players, half of whom were part of the side that finished 15th in the Championship last season, are the right ones to helped Wolves reach the Premier League. Neves poses the biggest questions of all. He has the raw ability, but does he have the mentality to thrive in the unrelenting and physical environment of the Championship? Is his game even suited to a league where less financially endowed clubs will see no shame in bypassing midfield altogether? Wolves\u2019 pre-season results have been mixed but they will be buoyed by a convincing win over Leicester City last Sunday. Neves, in a midfield two as part of a 3-4-3 formation, pulled the strings. The long-term motivation behind Neves\u2019s arrival in the Midlands seems clear. He is here to earn a move to a Premier League club. In his precocious years Liverpool and Chelsea were matched against his name and it is surely clubs of that marque Neves and his advisers still have in mind. Neither is the 20-year-old shy of admitting it. In an interview with Wolverhampton\u2019s Express and Star to commemorate his arrival, Neves was asked if he saw this move as a chance to put himself in the shop window. \u201cIt will be easier to move to the Premier League from here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m focused on getting better as a player and this is the right place to do so.\u201d Neves\u2019s arrival in England\u2019s second tier is not the only sign that the Championship is changing. The takeover of Leeds by the TV sports rights magnate Andrea Radrizzani. The arrivals of Leonid Slutsky at Hull and the Borussia Dortmund II\u2019s backroom staff at Norwich. A transfer window that has resulted in more than \u00a3130m being spent with a month still to run. The Championship is not England\u2019s second tier any more, it is the gateway to the Premier League. Expect more players like Neves to be persuaded of that."
"6||Amid fears of election violence, Kenyans seek a way past inter-ethnic conflictKenya\u2019s presidential and local elections, scheduled for next Tuesday, are being closely watched in the region and beyond for good reason. The country is one of Africa\u2019s most open societies, and an important commercial centre. It has flourishing, independent media, and numerous foreign investors, including global tech giants, have set up shop in what is one of the continent\u2019s leading hubs of technological innovation. But it also has a history of election-related violence \u2013 so many people are on edge as next Tuesday\u2019s elections approach. That history, as one commentator wisely remarked, explains why Kenyans prepare for elections in the same way others prepare for war or natural disasters. Voters are anxious to avoid a repeat of what happened in 2007, when a disputed presidential poll resulted in weeks of bloodletting. More than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed, with hundreds of thousands uprooted from their homes, amid ethnic conflict. While the following election in 2013 passed off relatively peacefully, memories of 2007 linger. Evidence of anxiety abounds. Supermarkets have been packed with shoppers stocking up on food and emergency supplies, while the main bus station in Nairobi is crammed with residents leaving the capital for more ethnically homogeneous rural areas perceived as safer. The shocking killing last weekend of Chris Msando, the official in charge of an electronic system designed to curb election-day cheating, has exacerbated tensions. Major observer groups have sent in heavyweights \u2013 including John Kerry, a former American secretary of state, and Thabo Mbeki and John Mahama, former presidents respectively of South Africa and Ghana \u2013 hoping to lean on political actors to behave responsibly. What lies behind the tension is that elections in Kenya are quasi-existential affairs for ethnic elites that stand to benefit enormously from control of the public purse. That politicians still run on political platforms based mainly on ethnic identity doesn\u2019t help. In this case, the presidential election is a two-way race between scions of the country\u2019s most prominent political families. The 55-year-old incumbent, Uhuru Kenyatta \u2013 son of the nation\u2019s first president \u2013 will seek to defend his seat against the opposition leader, 72-year-old Raila Odinga: the son of Kenya\u2019s first vice-president. Kenyatta is Kikuyu, the largest ethnic group, while Odinga is Luo, a major community whose members chafe at years of exclusion, primarily at the hands of Kikuyu elites. Partly in an attempt to lessen the stakes of the election and dilute the all-or-nothing nature of past presidential contests \u2013 and thus reduce risks of a repeat of a 2007-style crisis \u2013 Kenyans endorsed a new constitution in 2010 that significantly reshaped the structure of the state. Power and resources were distributed more evenly, notably by guaranteeing that at least 15% of all national revenue would be allocated to 47 governorates controlled by elected assemblies and governors. The 2017 presidential elections will undoubtedly be intensely contested \u2013 not least because Kenyatta will be seeking to avoid becoming the first Kenyan president not to secure re-election, while this is expected to be Odinga\u2019s last serious bid for the presidency \u2013 but the constitutional devolution of power could lower the heat. But there is a flipside. Along with the presidential contest, elections are taking place for local governorships. The new constitutional devolution means that governors will enjoy considerable power and budgets \u2013 possibly making these local elections more fraught and prone to violence. Added to this are the considerable institutional problems of preparing for the elections \u2013 a task all the more vexing given that the commission charged with running them was installed only six months ago. Ultimately, at the heart of Kenya\u2019s challenge lies a profoundly ethnicised form of politics on which the political class thrives. It is a political culture with deep historical roots. When the British colonised Kenya, divide-and-rule tactics became a de facto policy aimed at preventing a broad-based nationalist movement. By law, political parties had to be based on districts that were essentially ethnically homogeneous. After independence, the Kenyan political elites found in this system \u2013 and its ethnic divisions \u2013 a convenient way to entrench their power. Many have called for a change of course. When Barack Obama visited Kenya in 2015 \u2013 a \u201cson of the soil\u201d \u2013 he said, to rapturous applause, that a political system based on ethnic identity represents a \u201cfailure of the imagination\u201d and is \u201cdoomed to tear a country apart\u201d. Kenya boasts the region\u2019s most sophisticated and diversified economy. Yet its politics remain divisive and riven with conflict. The nation\u2019s vibrant civil society, its increasingly well-connected and well-educated young people, and the lively independent media must find ways to mobilise and pressure Kenya\u2019s politicians to abandon the us-v-them fearmongering, if elections are to stop being periods of high anxiety. \u2022 Murithi Mutiga is senior Kenya analyst for the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organisation"
"25||No more heavy loads: experts develop greener, lighter washing machineResearchers have developed a device to make washing machines lighter that could significantly reduce carbon emissions and the back pain of people having to install them. Washing machines typically contain one or more large concrete blocks, which can weigh more than 25kg (4st), in order to prevent them from moving during spin cycles. But the production and transportation of concrete creates carbon emissions and makes washing machines very heavy to transport, increasing fuel costs. To combat this, a team at Nottingham Trent University, including Dylan Knight, a 22-year-old undergraduate, developed a hollow plastic container that is filled with water once the machine is in place to stop it shaking violently or shuffling across the floor. Knight, who is studying product design, tested the lightweight device, which weighs less than 3kg when unfilled, and found it was equally effective as concrete blocks when filled with water. \u201cThe hollow container is left unfilled until the appliance is installed. We found it worked as good as a concrete counterweight, stopping the spinning drum from heavily vibrating the machine,\u201d he said. \u201cConcrete is actually quite bad for the environment due to the CO2 released when it is produced. The use of concrete is also the reason why washing machines are normally very heavy to move.\u201d The design cuts the weight of a typical machine by one-third, which in turn lowers the cost of fuel for transportation. About 3.5m washing machines are sold a year in the UK, and the team said that if each were fitted with the device, the carbon savings would equate to about 44,625 tonnes of carbon dioxide, in addition to the reduced fuel consumption. The idea for the project came from Tochi Tech, a design company working with researchers and students at the university to find innovative and sustainable solutions to appliance manufacturing. Prof Amin Al-Habaibeh, an expert in intelligent engineering systems, and Knight, who is from south-east London, designed the device in collaboration with Tochi Tech. Al-Habaibeh said: \u201cThis sustainable solution not only reduces cost and energy needed for transportation, but also provides ergonomic and health and safety benefits to those physically handling washing machines. \u201cThis is a great example of how we integrate our teaching and learning processes, and research with industry, to solve real problems and support job creation.\u201d Reducing the weight of washing machines in a lorry by 100kg could save approximately 8.5g of carbon dioxide emissions and 0.35 litres of fuel per 100km travelled. The research was provided through the Enabling Innovation programme at Nottingham Trent University. This is funded by the European Regional Development Fund, which \u201caims to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the European Union\u201d."
"11||NYOGB/Ad\u00e8s review \u2013 a controlled performance of vivid extremesThe programme that Thomas Ad\u00e8s has put together for his concerts this summer with the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain makes no concessions at all to the inexperience of this hugely talented band. The first UK performances of Francisco Coll\u2019s Mural, a 25-minute piece of striking symphonic ambition, are followed by one of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s own scores, Polaris, and Stravinsky\u2019s The Rite of Spring \u2013 a 20th-century classic and a piece with special significance in the history of NYOGB, ever since they played it for the first time in the 1970s under Pierre Boulez. It\u2019s a measure of the imagination and confidence of Coll\u2019s Mural, first performed in Luxembourg last year, that its impact wasn\u2019t diminished at all when heard alongside two such immensely powerful musical statements. The composer says it presents a synthesis of the musical language he has developed over the previous decade, and certainly there\u2019s the vivid instrumental imagery that one recognises from Coll\u2019s ensemble pieces. It is music of extremes, which is constantly reassessing its options and the directions it can take. The whole structure of Mural is tethered by a pair of slow movements \u2013 the churning, string-dominated canon that\u2019s placed at the centre of the five-movement scheme, and the finale, which opens vast, almost Brucknerian harmonic vistas as it proceeds. Only the second movement, a brief motoric scherzo that sounds as if Prokofiev is lurking somewhere in its genes, seems a bit secondhand; the rest is marvellously original. NYOGB certainly played Mural superbly, just as it made Ad\u00e8s\u2019s piece into the orchestral tour de force it\u2019s designed to be, with its four groups of extra brass deployed around the Maltings auditorium, and the onstage orchestra generating textures of immense rhythmic intricacy. If it sometimes seems like an unlikely marriage of Jan\u00e1\u010dek and John Adams overlaid on tectonic harmonies that hark back to Sibelius, Polaris undeniably does what it sets out to achieve. There was marvellous orchestral security in The Rite of Spring, too, from its opening bassoon solo onwards, though as a whole the performance didn\u2019t have quite the sense of feral excitement one hoped for. Ad\u00e8s seemed to be holding back just a fraction, putting precision before theatrical vividness. It was hugely impressive all the same. \u2022At the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 5 August.

"7||\u2018Not about the money\u2019: Neymar checks in at PSG relishing his new challengeNeymar has dismissed suggestions his world-record \u00a3198m move to Paris Saint-Germain was motivated by money and instead insisted he had moved to the French capital for \u201ca new challenge\u201d. A little more than 12 hours after his transfer from Barcelona was confirmed, the Brazilian was introduced as a PSG player in front of the world\u2019s media at the Parc des Princes just after lunch on Friday. Waiting for a glimpse of their new star, hundreds of PSG fans had thronged the streets outside the stadium throughout the morning. When Neymar appeared a few boys perched on their fathers\u2019 shoulders cried at the sight of the 25-year-old. \u201cI wanted something bigger, a bigger challenge. This was about ambition,\u201d Naymar said. \u201cMy heart told me it was time to sign for Paris Saint-Germain. It was the right time to leave Barcelona. I was never motivated by money. I thought above all else about the happiness of my family, regardless of money. I\u2019m really sad some people think this is the case.\u201d When asked how he felt about becoming the most valuable player of all time, surpassing Paul Pogba following his \u00a389m move to Manchester United last summer, Neymar even found time for a joke: \u201cIt\u2019s not an extra burden. I weigh 69kg and I\u2019ll remain at 69kg.\u201d Nasser al-Khelaifi, the PSG owner, then took the striker on a tour of the stadium, where PSG will take on promoted Amiens on Saturday in the first match of the Ligue 1 season. Despite yet having to train with his team-mates, Neymar has not ruled out playing some part. The occasion was certainly a triumph for Khelaifi, whose Qatar Sports Investments bought a majority share in PSG six years ago. \u201cFor me Neymar is the best player in the world, so we wanted to have the best player in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cNeymar came here to write new pages in the history of Paris Saint-Germain. With him our project will grow even stronger. The league will become more interesting for everyone. More transfers? The best player in the world is here. Let\u2019s enjoy Neymar.\u201d The supporters outside did not take much persuading. \u201cThis is the best day of my life,\u201d said S\u00e9bastien, a PSG season ticket holder for 20 years. \u201cI cannot believe a player of Neymar\u2019s calibre is playing for my team. It is a dream come true for all the PSG fans and for French football in general as well. He is bigger than anything we have seen before in France.\u201d By lunchtime the club shop on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es had reported record sales, with Neymar\u2019s replica No10 shirt being sold for \u00a3140. The transfer has not been well received by everyone, however. An hour before he was due to appear, the international players\u2019 association released a statement demanding an investigation into \u201canti-competitive, unjustified and illegal\u201d Fifa transfer rules. \u201cFifpro is calling on the European Commission to investigate the flow of money via transfer fees within the EU territory to understand their impact on competitive balance in the region.\u201d Barcelona confirmed a \u00a323.5m bonus due to Neymar and his father as part of a bonus for his contract renewal last year will not be paid. The amount had been deposited with a notary but a Bar\u00e7a spokesman Josep Vives claimed \u201cagreed conditions have not been met\u201d. He added: \u201cThere were three conditions \u2013 one, that the player didn\u2019t negotiate with another club before 31 July; two, that he publicly expressed his decision to fulfil his contract; and three, the payment was to be made on 1 September to ensure he didn\u2019t go to another club. With these criteria not met, Barcelona will not pay the renewal bonus.\u201d Neymar is expected to fight Bar\u00e7a\u2019s decision in court but that is a battle for another day."
"15||UK judges rule DWP wrong to deny appeals over refused benefitsThe Department for Work and Pensions has been unlawfully stopping people going to tribunal to appeal against decisions to refuse them benefits, three senior judges have ruled. The upper tribunal found it was wrong for the DWP to refuse claimants the right to appeal if they took more than a month to ask for a review of the benefit decision. It comes just a week after a supreme court finding that the government was unlawfully charging fees of up to \u00a31,200 for access to employment tribunals. The DWP system was challenged by the Child Poverty Action Group and two claimants with serious mental health problems who were refused disability benefits and then failed to ask for an internal review within the one-month time limit. They made late applications for an internal review, called \u201cmandatory reconsideration\u201d, of their benefit decisions, but the DWP initially refused to change the decision or let a tribunal consider whether that was correct. The judges found: \u201cThe reality is that many claimants will be vulnerable for reasons including issues relating to their mental health or learning disabilities. It is obvious that there is a high risk that many of them with good claims on the merits will miss time limits. \u201cThis risk has been exacerbated over recent years by changes in the scope of legal aid and local authority and advice sector provision, and hence the reduction in the numbers of welfare rights officers and others who are readily available to assist claimants with their benefits claims and appeals.\u201d They concluded: \u201cWe are concerned with the situation where a claimant sends the secretary of state a request for a mandatory reconsideration to which the secretary of state responds by stating that the application is late and does not meet the criteria for extending time. We have concluded that as a matter of statutory interpretation a claimant in such circumstances has a statutory right of appeal to the first-tier tribunal.\u201d The Child Poverty Action Group said the upper tribunal decision would protect the appeal rights of the hundreds of thousands of benefit claimants who each year seek to challenge refusal of benefit. The case related to employment and support allowance (ESA), but affects all those who claim benefits from the DWP, although not tax credits through HM Revenue and Customs. It comes after a freedom of information request revealed the DWP has a target to uphold 80% of its original benefit decisions after the internal \u201cmandatory reconsideration\u201d reviews. About 12% of employment and support allowance (work capability assessment) decisions are overturned at mandatory reconsideration, but the figure rises to 59% of those that make it to the tribunal stage. The government had argued that claimants had recourse to judicial review if their right to go to tribunal was refused, but the judges observed that out of 1,544,805 mandatory reconsideration decisions made by the government between 2013 and 2017, there had not been a single example of a claimant taking this legal path. Carla Clarke, the legal officer for Child Poverty Action Group, said it was \u201cnot only a vindication for our two clients, but it stands to provide justice for significant numbers of families wrongly denied the financial help to which they are entitled\u201d. \u201cThis decision ensures that even if the DWP thinks there is no good reason for their delay, it cannot prevent such individuals pursuing an appeal before an independent tribunal. To have found otherwise would have been to uphold a system where the decision-maker also acts as arbiter of whether an individual could challenge their decision or not \u2013 a clear conflict of interest and an affront to justice,\u201d Clarke said. The Department of Work and Pensions said: \u201cWe have received the tribunal\u2019s decision and are considering the judgment.\u201d"
"12||'Everything that's wrong with humanity': readers on troubling TV shows, from GoT to BuffyFrom over reliance on race and class stereotypes to scripts that would clearly fail the Bechdel test, many of our favourite TV shows from Eastenders to Sex and the City, from Sherlock to the Simpsons are problematic. After a piece in the Guardian this week about what shows writers felt had left a negative impact, we wanted to know about the TV shows that readers have found problematic too. Here is what you said. The Big Bang Theory \u2018The show reinforces negative stereotypes about geeks\u2019 - James, from London Every episode seems to contain jokes that are out of date and it is far from portraying \u2018geeks\u2019 in a new light. They just reinforce negative stereotypes about them. Other stereotypes include Indians through Raj, Jews through Howard, women through all of the female characters. Those with social problems are also portrayed as being likely to be on the spectrum to some degree. \u2018It misrepresents women in science to an insulting degree\u2019 - Joanne, from Ireland Penny is a character who exists entirely as an object for nerds to gawk over, and so we can be reminded that women like her (thin, conventionally good looking) are not scientists. When the show does include women who are scientists they are represented as socially inept, frumpy, and typically in biological sciences which are seen as soft. Leonard takes advantage of and has sex with Penny when she is clearly too drunk to consent, and the defense of this is \u2018what nerdy guy would turn the opportunity down?\u2019. Sheldon makes those on the spectrum easy bullying targets and adds fuel to the already infuriating stereotypes about those of us who suffer with OCD. The whole show misrepresents women in Stem fields to an insulting degree while patting itself on the back for inspiring kids to get involved in Stem. Buffy the Vampire Slayer \u2018There\u2019s major problems with the concept of consent - and where are the people of colour?\u2019 - Amy, from Bristol I absolutely adore Buffy for its writing, the way it portrayed Tara and Willow\u2019s relationship at a time when lesbian relationships were invisible on this kind of show, and for its strong young female characters owning their own power. But where are the people of colour? As a young black woman watching the show for the first time 20 years ago, I was given Kendra with the questionable accent, and for a few episodes Rona, a streetwise, jaded potential slayer with dreadlocks. Joss Whedon\u2019s feminism didn\u2019t seem broad enough to include women like me. The show also had major problems with the concept of consent. Spike is a fantastic creation, but I will never understand the writers\u2019 decision to use the attempted rape of the show\u2019s strongest woman as a catalyst for male character development. Add in Willow sleeping with Tara after wiping her memory of an argument, Faith having sex with Riley while in Buffy\u2019s body, and true-to-life sexbots made to order by a male character, and a nasty theme emerges. Game of Thrones \u2018Under pressure to make the female characters more powerful, the writers have made them more psychopathic than the worst of the male villains\u2019 - Joanna, from the UK Following the rightful backlash to the rape of Sansa Stark in season five of Game of Thrones, the showrunners felt the need to put women \u2018on top\u2019 from season six. This amounted to nothing more than making many of the female characters even more psychopathic and irrational than the worst of the male villains. Ellaria Sand, a wise voice reminding her step-daughters of the futility of vengeance in the books, had her character completely altered to the point that she became a kin-slayer. She decides that the best path of revenge for the death of her lover, Oberyn Martell, is to have his beloved brother and nephew killed. Sansa also becomes a miniature version of Cersei and Arya goes from caring deeply about justice to massacring a hall of people just because their last name was Frey. \u2018A feast of everything that is wrong with humanity\u2019 - Anton, from Sydney, Australia Where do I begin? Shockingly and abjectly sexist, codifying women as sexual slaves at worst and as conniving breeders at best. Daenerys is forced into marriage and raped by the Dothraki leader. The show elevates misogyny to an art form and celebrates it in all episodes. Racism is an issue too - the Dothraki just happen to be of Middle Eastern appearance and are treated accordingly. Animal cruelty is everywhere - dead animals abound - and even horses are beheaded. Human cruelty in every episode. That such a travesty would be embraced and lauded on mainstream television is truly a feast of everything that is wrong with humanity. How I Met Your Mother \u2019Producers even published a book celebrating Barney\u2019s womanising\u2019 - Tim, from Trier, Germany The true star of How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM) has arguably always been the character of Barney Stinson. What the audience, however, completely chooses to ignore is the blatant misogyny and sexism of the character. Women are portrayed throughout as incredibly foolish as they fall for every unrealistic and humiliating trick Barney uses on them. Women are degraded to objects and trophies such as when Barney makes a challenge out of sleeping with seven women in seven days. His sexism is even documented in the Playbook which the producers of the show then published as a real book, making his absurd tricks towards women seem cool. In the rare moments one of his female friends objects to his comments, they are shut down. Perhaps what\u2019s most bizarre is when Ted Moseby, as the narrator of the show, tells all of these stories to his teenage children in the future, they do not question their father\u2019s strange attitude towards the sexist character that is Barney."
"5||Peter Venables obituaryThe career of my father, Peter Venables, who has died aged 94, spanned the entire development of modern psychology. He made landmark contributions to the fields of schizophrenia and psychophysiology. His most striking and innovative contribution in this area came in 2012, when he documented for the first time that early malnutrition at the age of three predisposed to schizotypal personality 20 years later in adulthood. His findings helped inform thinking about early-years support for disadvantaged families. Peter was born in Ilfracombe, Devon, the son of Lilian (nee Harris) and Henry Venables, who ran a sweet shop. Peter attended Calday Grange grammar school, and at 16 he started work at Post Office Telephones as an apprentice. The assignment which gave him most pride was the installation of telecommunications equipment on HMS Largs, a ship that took part in every allied landing. Called up in 1944, he joined the navy and worked as a radar technician. By this time, through left-wing mutual friends he had met Agnes Hawkins, known as Ness, who demonstrated recipes for meals on rations, and later worked on food books and campaigns. They married in 1948 and later, at weekends, extended a cottage in Caterham, Surrey and built its fitted furniture. On demobilisation in 1947, Peter received a government grant and studied psychology at University College London, graduating with a first in 1951. He received his PhD from the Institute of Psychiatry in 1953. His first job was with the Medical Research Council. He was then for three years a reader in the department of psychology at Birkbeck College, south London, where he was given a personal chair and finally appointed dean of the faculty of science (1968-74). In 1972, with two colleagues, Peter set up the Mauritius Joint Child Health study. This study collected data on nearly 2,000 children and is probably the most extensive prospective psychophysiological study of mental health in the world. Two years later he was appointed to found the department of psychology at the University of York. He established the principles of the department: that psychology is most influential when it is quantitative, biological and experimental. His early experience as a post office engineer and navy radar technician equipped him to think about the \u201cwiring\u201d of the brain in an analogous way. In 1980 he became president of the BPS and went on to receive the society\u2019s lifetime achievement award in 2015. He was a brilliant photographer who used to process large colour prints at home, and a generous supporter of many charities. He was resilient and dignified in the face of Ness\u2019s dementia. She died in 2010. Peter is survived by his sons, Andrew and me, seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren."
"21||\u2018I was aware of being naked for about three minutes, then I forgot\u2019I\u2019ve been working with Gregory Crewdson since 2004. He\u2019s more like a film director than a photographer \u2013 he creates staged, cinematic, often unsettling large-scale art images, working with huge crews, casting directors and big budgets. His latest series of pictures, Cathedral Of The Pines, took four years to shoot, from planning to post-production. He usually employs casting directors to find people to feature in his pictures, but for this series he photographed local friends and family for the first time. It\u2019s his most personal project yet. His backdrop is always small-town America. Cathedral Of The Pines was shot in Becket, in Berkshire County, Massachussetts. It has a church, a general store, a library and little else. New Yorkers own summer homes here, and there\u2019s a small year-round population. Gregory moved here in 2010; he was going through a sad, difficult divorce, wasn\u2019t working much, and was doing a lot of hiking, open-water swimming and cross-country skiing. My parents live in Becket, and I was nearby, so Gregory and I would get together regularly, often with our children. I became more closely involved with his work \u2013 and today we\u2019re partners in life, too. One day in 2012, we were skiing across a frozen pond and something stirred a memory in Gregory; I remember his face lighting up for the first time in two years. Later that day, we stumbled on a sign for Cathedral of the Pines, a memorial site in a forest dedicated to servicemen and women. These photographs grew from that day. All the interior shots are taken at my parents\u2019 house; they bought it in 1979, and it has barely changed since then. Gregory loves it \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful but ordinary, and dated. Overgrown hedges surround the house. They left town for the whole summer in 2013 so we could take over. Each photograph took two days to shoot. On the first day, the subjects learn what they\u2019ll be doing and where they\u2019ll be standing, and the shot is lit. Gregory only shoots at twilight, so the following day, there\u2019s a lot of waiting around, a build-up of anticipation, then a brief, intense period of activity. Exterior shots are bigger operations: the Becket fire department would do a \u201cwet down\u201d, where you hose down a street to make it look as if it\u2019s been raining \u2013 a common movie technique. And they cut holes in the ice on lakes for us. We were allowed to use the church as a changing area, and we often ate lunch in there. I\u2019m usually extremely shy about being photographed, let alone naked. But Gregory creates a calm, supportive environment. There were about 10 people on set during this shoot. I was aware of being naked for about three minutes, then I forgot. It\u2019s hard to hold a pose for 90 minutes. Gregory uses long exposures, which means you have to be very still. I didn\u2019t dare breathe when the shutter was open, for about three seconds. But it\u2019s harder to find your position again if you move around, so it was easier to stay still. These photographs are huge, so it\u2019s a special thing to see them hanging in a gallery, in a totally different place \u2013 Paris, say, or London. I\u2019ve seen this picture so often I don\u2019t even think of it as me; I usually refer to her as \u201cthe woman\u201d. She\u2019s in another world. \u2022 Cathedral Of The Pines is at the Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London W1, until 8 October. Are you in a notable photograph? Email thatsme@theguardian.com"

"24||Experience: I am a professional mermaidI grew up in St Ives, on the Cornish coast, so as a child I spent a lot of time in the water. The sea has always fascinated me. The film Splash was a huge part of my childhood and people even called me a mermaid because I spent so much time underwater. But then I grew up. In 2015 I was in a relationship with someone who lived in London. I was in my mid-20s and thought the big city lifestyle was what I wanted, so I decided to move to the capital to be with her. I found a job with the NHS but unfortunately my relationship soon fell apart. I didn\u2019t have a support network in London and it was lonely. The anxiety I\u2019d always suffered from became extreme, and I developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. I couldn\u2019t eat or sleep, had night sweats and all-day tremors. After five months in London I decided to hand in my notice and drive home to Cornwall. It was a life-saving decision. Back in St Ives I picked up a summer job in catering and started spending more time on the beach and in the water. One evening I went out paddleboarding and as I paddled back into the harbour, I witnessed the most gorgeous sunset; the whole harbour was glowing. That\u2019s when I realised this was where I was meant to be. I imagined how magical it would be if a mermaid swam into St Ives on an evening like this, and what a stir it would cause. Then I thought maybe I could be that mermaid. I knew there was someone in the US who made mermaid tails and after talking it over with friends \u2013 some of whom thought I was mad \u2013 I ordered mine online. Weighing two stone, it is custom-made from silicone and neoprene, and cost me about \u00a3800. The tail arrived in the autumn of 2015 and I did my first public swim as a mermaid the following February. I posted on Instagram that people might see a mermaid in St Ives, then I slipped into the water in my tail and swam around the harbour for about 45 minutes. There weren\u2019t many people but some quickly spotted me \u2013 much to their bafflement. Initially I thought that whenever I had a spare moment I would hop into the sea and surprise people. But it quickly captured imaginations and my appearances evolved into scheduled \u201cwash-ups\u201d. I\u2019ve found a secret cove where I change into my tail and swim out to sea. Rocks shelter me from view before I appear swimming towards the beach, giving the illusion that I have swum in from the middle of the ocean. I use social media to announce where and when I will be appearing and swim right up on to the beach so children and parents can talk to me and take photos. Despite having my legs encased, swimming in the tail came very naturally to me. It does require a lot of upper body strength, though, and I\u2019ve discovered shoulder muscles that I never knew existed. After my appearances are over I swim back to my secret cove and either wash up on the beach or pull myself up on some rocks, depending on the tide. My partner meets me there with my clothes, so I can change out of my tail. At home I rinse it in a shallow bath before drying it as thoroughly as possible. This is crucial as tails can go mouldy and smell, so I blast it with a portable heater. My tail gets a lot of wear and tear. Luckily my other half is very good at crafting \u2013 when I ripped it on a rock recently she managed to fix it with a silicone gun. My colleagues at the hospital where I work as a receptionist are incredibly supportive of my life as a mermaid. It helps explain the odd bit of residual glitter. Although I now also do private appearances, my beach wash-ups are voluntary. It\u2019s a way of giving something back to the town that helped to heal me. In the last couple of years I\u2019ve come to understand myself in a way I didn\u2019t before and \u201cmermaiding\u201d, as I call it, has been a big part of that. Anxiety will always be a part of my life but I\u2019ve learned some really good coping mechanisms, and returning to St Ives has made me realise how much I need to be in and near the sea. It\u2019s part of who I am. I\u2019m often a bundle of nerves as I approach the beach, but as soon as I do my first tail flick and dive under, I\u2019m fine. \u2022 As told to Alice Wright Do you have an experience to share?

"24||Stark, Broadstairs, Kent: \u2018I find it hard to pick holes\u2019 \u2013 restaurant reviewIn 10 years or so years of living in this bucket-and-spade Kentish seaside town, I\u2019ve never had the urge to review on my doorstep. Sure, I\u2019ve ventured to Margate, or Dalston-sur-Mer, as local snark goes, but preserved-in-aspic Broadstairs, nuh. I\u2019ve been to Stark three times, each time thinking, \u201cI can\u2019t write about this.\u201d It\u2019s ludicrously tiny, kitchen the size of a broom cupboard: could it cope with the attention? They don\u2019t even have functioning loos: there\u2019s an arrangement with the pub across the road. Will some terrible jobsworth hammer them for it? (If they do, they\u2019ll have me to answer to.) It\u2019s open Wednesday to Saturday evenings only, too, so is it an actual restaurant or more like a supper club? It took an unconscionable amount of time for the place even to open, possibly because chef-owner Ben Crittenden and his dad did the build. There are no staff: Ben\u2019s wife Sophie runs the minuscule floor. It\u2019s clearly that most overused of expressions, a labour of love, and I spend far too much time over dinner trying to work out how the hell they make it pay. But this is Weekend\u2019s seaside issue and I\u2019ve run out of excuses. Because Crittenden, in his Munchkin empire with its single, solitary fridge, is the real deal. In an unlikely turn of events, a proper talent has landed in this former sandwich bar yards from Viking Bay beach. His last major gig was at The West House, Biddenden, the best restaurant I\u2019ve never written about. Its boss, Graham Garrett, is clearly as good at spotting virtuosity as he was at being a rock\u2019n\u2019roll drummer and coming up with book titles (Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Sausage Rolls: I mean, joy of that?). Now Crittenden has gone it alone: baby steps scale-wise, sure, but seven-league-boots strides as far as anything Thanet has seen since some French bloke tried to lure Michelin to Margate about 12 years ago. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s a no-choice menu: six courses. Does it change often? Depending on the vagaries of local suppliers and the contents of that fridge, it can change on the night. There\u2019s nothing at all small-time or provincial about what\u2019s served: ingredients, composition, presentation are all evidence of someone who is used to working to the most exacting contemporary standards. Sure, Crittenden has done his time on bloody MasterChef: The Professionals \u2013 is there now a chef\u2019s CV template check-box for that? \u2013 but fortunately the show\u2019s hegemony of gimmicky complexity hasn\u2019t made it on to these plates. Here, every \u201cnow\u201d component and technique has its place: matcha custard, dashi, curing and pickling, homemade breads, pearly goat butter, smoked salt. There\u2019s usually chicken liver parfait of preternatural silkiness and delicacy, and huge flavour; this time, it comes with pickled Kent cherries, dots of coffee and cherry puree, brioche and a shingle of hazelnut granola \u2013 sharp, sweet, aromatic, rich, luxurious. There\u2019s cured trout, diced into almost-tataki, the potential jangliness of blackcurrant, dill and acidulated fennel tamed by a spoonful of thick, cultured cream that gleefully pulls the whole thing together. Hake, liquorice-black with squid ink on the outside, startling and beautiful in its creamy-white centre, is crowned with basil oil tapioca \u201ccaviar\u201d and bathed in a sparklingly clear broth of tomato and dashi that all but yodels with umami. Poussin, crisp of skin and succulent of flesh with a Day-Glo swoop of pea and lettuce puree, has broth, too, this time of chicken stock and \u201cSmoko\u201d. Me, neither \u2013 turns out it\u2019s a blend of formosa oolong and lapsang souchong from Hythe-based Debonair Tea Co. (And if that little lot doesn\u2019t get me into Pseud\u2019s Corner again, there\u2019s no justice in this world. Pass the kombucha martini.) I find it hard to pick holes. All I can whinge about is a tendency towards over-sweetening: the granola and slightly cakey brioche with the parfait; and a dessert featuring a crisp-wibbly matcha custard tart, various iterations of strawberry and pistachio sorbet (glorious, Pacojet-smooth) would benefit from less sugar. On earlier visits, the wine flight was less fine dining and more corner shop; it\u2019s still a bit basic, but improved beyond measure to gew\u00fcrtzraminers and albari\u00f1os and primitivos. (I\u2019ll overlook the chocolate wine served with a lovely assembly of honeycomb, raspberries and chocolate; I see what they\u2019re doing there, but the official tasting note is still, \u201cUgggghhh.\u201d) Otherwise, it\u2019s a lovely, unexpected little thing.

"19||US jobs report: Trump given good news as economy adds 209,000 jobs in JulyThe US economy added 209,000 new jobs in July \u2013 the second month in a row of 200,000-plus jobs growth. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, a 16-year low. Economists had forecast the US would add 180,000 jobs in July, in line with the average monthly gain for the last six months. The latest jobs news will come as a welcome relief for Donald Trump, who was elected on the promise of rebuilding the US jobs market. \u201cExcellent Jobs Numbers just released,\u201d the president tweeted, \u201cand I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!\u201d Ahead of the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the president heralded the announcement that Toyota and Mazda would soon be adding 4,000 new jobs at two new US plants. June\u2019s job gains were revised up from 222,000 to 231,000. However, the jobs report showed once again that the majority of gains were in low-paying service industries. Jobs in food services and drinking establishments rose by 53,000 in July. The industry has added 313,000 jobs over the year. Healthcare employment increased by 39,000. Job growth in higher-paid sectors including construction, manufacturing and mining was marginal. Wage growth has remained lackluster since the recovery from the last recession and was a mediocre 2.5% higher in July this year compared to July 2016. \u201cOverall, this morning\u2019s report shows the recovery continues, but with wage growth below target levels, it is abundantly clear that we have a ways to go before we reach genuine full employment \u2013 where workers including young and old, and workers of all races can fully benefit from the economy,\u201d wrote Economics Policy Institute senior economist Elise Gould. On Wednesday, the payroll processor ADP said US businesses had added 178,000 in July, less than the 190,000 forecast. ADP reported job gains in all sectors except for manufacturing, which lost 4,000 jobs. The biggest gainers were professional and business services, up 65,000, and education and health services, up 43,000. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, which helps compile the ADP report, said: \u201cThe American job machine continues to operate in high gear. \u201cJob gains are broad-based across industries and company sizes, with only manufacturers reducing their payrolls. At this pace of job growth, unemployment will continue to quickly decline.\u201d"
"1||Swans thump Cats in Friday night AFL fizzer \u2013\u00a0as it happenedIt\u2019s all over at Simonds Stadium, on a fairly miserable night for the Cats. They started without their biggest star in Patrick Dangerfield, and ended the night without their skipper Joel Selwood, who battled through an ankle injury for the second half of the game. It\u2019s the biggest loss at home for the Cats since 2006, when rivals Hawthorn beat them by 56. The Cats stay stuck on 50 points on the ladder - just 2 ahead of GWS and Richmond, both still to play. For the Swans it was an emphatic win without their skipper and midfield star Josh P Kennedy. Stand-in captain Luke Parker led the way with 23 disposals (13 contested possessions, 8 clearances, 14 tackles and a goal). McVeigh and Hannebery had 21 each, Hannebery had 12 contested possessions, 4 clearances and 5 tackles, while McVeigh went at 86% disposal efficiency. Will Hayward and Tom Papley top-scored with 3 goals each. Listening to the banjo solo of the Swans\u2019 \u2018Cheer, Cheer the Red and the White\u2019 made me think of Jonathan Horn\u2019s piece today on the history of AFL club theme songs. Check it out. I\u2019ll be back here tomorrow for the Australia Sportwatch live blog, which kicks off at 1pm. Join me for minute-by-minute action of the all-important clash between GWS and Melbourne, before the Sharks v Raiders game in the NRL tomorrow night, and anything and everything sport in between. Thanks to everyone who read, followed, tweeted or emailed in, especially the disgruntled Bombers fan who did not much like my reference to Joel Selwood\u2019s painkillers (nah, actually he thought it was pretty funny). AFL Q4 01:35 remaining Geelong 8.13 (61) v Sydney 16.11 (107) Beautiful long, snap goal by Hayward for his third. Nice return for the youngster. Just over a minute to go. AFL Q4 02:51 remaining Geelong 8.13 (61) v Sydney 15.11 (101) Big, courageous mark from Hayward running back with the flight of the ball. He can\u2019t convert, however. I\u2019ve got RSI from typing \u2018miss\u2019 and \u2018can\u2019t convert\u2019. Ironically Menegola finally scores a goal - with a couple of minutes to go and my RSI well advanced. AFL Q4 04:52 remaining Geelong 7.13 (55) v Sydney 15.10 (100) Scott Selwood misses an easy set shot, after the Cats finally got a holding the ball for diving on the ball. They can\u2019t get anything going their way. Selwood himself hasn\u2019t stopped trying - with 13 tackles for the night. Menegola has a chance to kick a set shot from the same spot he missed from not so long ago - and misses again. It\u2019s contagious. AFL Q4 10:02 remaining Geelong 7.10 (52) v Sydney 15.10 (100) Nice tackle on Parker who fumbles and holding the ball goes to Menegola and the Cats. 10 minutes left for the Cats to try get some pride back. AFL Q4 12:27 remaining Geelong 7.9 (51) v Sydney 15.10 (100) Cats fans start to leave the ground, but no risk of them regretting it like Port fans did against St Kilda last week. Hayward gets one out of the air after Jack kicked it long into the square. Swans having fun now. AFL Q4 13:53 remaining Geelong 7.9 (51) v Sydney 14.10 (94) Lovely goal from Heeney, on the run 40m out. It\u2019s a match-high lead to the Swans. AFL Q4 14:32 remaining Geelong 7.9 (51) v Sydney 13.10 (88) Deliberate paid against Grundy for an errant handpass, which gifts Simpson a shot on goal. He misses a right-foot banana. AFL Q4 15:47 remaining Geelong 7.8 (50) v Sydney 13.10 (88) Looked to be a massive goal to Buzza (who was possibly 60m out?) but Guthrie gives away a free on the goal line for hands in the back. Cats are unravelling. Joel Selwood looks to be done for the day, as he takes a seat at the back of the bench. AFL Q4 17:20 remaining Geelong 7.8 (50) v Sydney 13.10 (88) Rohan has a chance to put the result even further beyond doubt but misses after a lazy snap at goal. You\u2019d think the Cats are too far behind to mount any serious challenge. AFL three-quarter-time Geelong 7.8 (50) v Sydney 11.9 (75) Geelong winning the disposal count easily (300-232), as well as the clearances (35-24), contested possessions (115-104) and hit-outs (33-25). They are however being out-tackled (71-65), while the Swans hold a very slim advantage in the inside 50s (33-32). They had plenty of chances that quarter, but couldn\u2019t capitalise. AFL three-quarter-time Geelong 7.8 (50) v Sydney 11.9 (75) Franklin finally gets a touch in space just outside the 50 - where he likes it best, in other words - but misses everything and the ball dribbles out of play. Hasn\u2019t been his night. The Swans get another chance through McVeigh - who has been shifted forward while Reid goes back. But he can\u2019t convert either, and hits the post. Franklin gives away a free to Joel Selwood, whose troublesome ankle gets caught in the tackle. He looks to be in pain (and trouble) again on the siren. AFL Q3 02:37 remaining Geelong 7.8 (50) v Sydney 11.7 (73) Smart play by McVeigh to lower the eyes and hit up Sinclair on a lead, only 30m out, tight angle. He misses - and again, the Swans fail to put the Cats away. Franklin hasn\u2019t touched it this quarter. AFL Q3 04:22 remaining Geelong 7.8 (50) v Sydney 11.7 (73) Great tackle by Parker wins the Swans a holding the ball, which winds up in the hands of Nic Newman. He boots a big goal from 55m out. That hurts for the Cats. Almost immediately, however, they get the reply they need through Guthrie. The Swans can\u2019t seem to finally put the Cats away, but the Cats aren\u2019t coming quite close enough, either. AFL Q3 05:45 remaining Geelong 6.8 (44) v Sydney 10.6 (66) According to the Channel Seven commentary team, the Swans were 0-6 down early in the season and then \u201cthings just changed\u201d... indeed. Menegola has a very important shot at goal - after Hawkins found him on a closer lead - but can\u2019t convert. Plenty of missed opportunities this quarter for Geelong. Back down the other end of the ground, a heavily bandaged Parker re-emerges after Rohan pinpoints a pass to his stand-in skipper. He misses an easy one. AFL Q3 07:59 remaining Geelong 6.7 (43) v Sydney 10.6 (66) Duncan races to 28 disposals - probably benefiting from Hewett\u2019s close checking of Selwood. Papley snaps off the pack but lacks accuracy. Luke Parker is off with a decent-looking blood rule. AFL Q3 11:35 remaining Geelong 6.7 (43) v Sydney 10.5 (65) Scott Selwood gets one high inside the 50 - but looked to drop the knees. He kicks into the man on the mark in some poetic justice. Swans clear after some great team defence. AFL Q3 12:53 remaining Geelong 6.7 (43) v Sydney 10.5 (65) They\u2019ve found some space in the middle, the Cats. Duncan now has 24 disposals - 7 contested possessions, at 80% disposal efficiency, 3 clearances and 4 tackles. Sam Simpson has a shot at goal but looks nervous, dishes it off messily and the Cats waste yet another opportunity at goal. AFL Q3 14:59 remaining Geelong 6.7 (43) v Sydney 10.5 (65) Joel Selwood has been in everything since returning - not sure how he\u2019s doing it, but he\u2019s making an impact. Great body work from Hawkins who completely outmuscles Grundy for another shot at goal. Again, he can\u2019t make the distance, as the ball drifts well across goal. Meanwhile Tom Stewart misses everything, out on the full. Some wasted chances for the Cats. AFL Q3 16:10 remaining Geelong 6.7 (43) v Sydney 10.5 (65) Fortunate bounce for Parsons after a miskick from Scott Selwood falls into his arms. Nice snap though for the opening goal to the Cats. AFL Q3 17:34 remaining Geelong 5.7 (37) v Sydney 10.5 (65) Menegola finds Hawkins on a lead - Hawkins, however, fell to the ground after marking and looked in pain. He was OK to take the kick - but didn\u2019t make the distance, and accuracy wasn\u2019t there either. Rushed through. AFL half-time Geelong 5.6 (36) v Sydney 10.5 (65) Have just seen Joel Selwood up and running and looking completely fine in the rooms - thank god for needles! AFL half-time Geelong 5.6 (36) v Sydney 10.5 (65) Did anyone else just watch that bizarre Swisse ad? What was with that emotional piano solo? Are we selling pharmaceuticals or life insurance? Does this happen every week? And yes, thanks Kate for the observation for that neither Swisse ambassador is actually fit to play. AFL half-time Geelong 5.6 (36) v Sydney 10.5 (65) Injury alert: Joel Selwood went straight down into the rooms after that ankle injury and hasn\u2019t emerged at all (says Matthew Richardson, stalking the locked changeroom door). In all seriousness, you\u2019d think that\u2019s game over for Geelong if he doesn\u2019t come back. Or a momentous, unlikely victory... either way, it\u2019s backs against the wall for the Cats. AFL half-time Geelong 5.6 (36) v Sydney 10.5 (65) And just because it was so good, check out this brilliant Hannebery goal through so many defenders. AFL half-time Geelong 5.6 (36) v Sydney 10.5 (65) Here\u2019s that Franklin goal. Been well held by Lonergan, but he doesn\u2019t need much of an opportunity to swoop. AFL half-time Geelong 5.6 (36) v Sydney 10.5 (65) Hannebery goes hard at the hard-ball (surprise, surprise) and the ball spills out the back of the pack to Lance Franklin - who finally gets his first. It\u2019s back out to 29 points, but undoubtedly the story of the second quarter is the apparent injury to Joel Selwood. Will he return? Have to think the Cats are in a lot of trouble with no Danger, no Joel Selwood. AFL Q2 02:36 remaining Geelong 5.6 (36) v Sydney 9.5 (59) Joel Selwood looks very, very sore - he can\u2019t put any weight on his left leg and is being helped by two trainers. Incredibly bad news for the Cats if he doesn\u2019t return. Another goal to Gary Rohan on the run puts some space between the Swans and Cats. AFL Q2 03:44 remaining Geelong 5.6 (36) v Sydney 8.5 (53) Sam Reid is back behind the ball to mind Hawkins while the Swans look to get Grundy back on the ground (he\u2019s still off in a costly absence that has seen two Hawkins goals). Guthrie almost kicks a fourth for the Swans - but hits the post. Still no Grundy. AFL Q2 05:24 remaining Geelong 5.5 (35) v Sydney 8.5 (53) Make that three in a row for the Cats - Hawkins one on one with Rampe uses his body and outworks him to it. That\u2019s his third - and the Cats are back to 18 points behind. AFL Q2 06:19 remaining Geelong 4.5 (29) v Sydney 8.5 (53) Geelong get back-to-back goals, this time through Menegola, who is fired up. Margin back to 24 from 37. Top disposal getters - Scott Selwood has 15 for Geelong, with 6 contested possessions, 5 clearances and 5 tackles. Mitch Duncan and Zach Tuohy follow with 14 each - Duncan has 79% disposal efficiency with 4 tackles and 3 clearances. It has been much more of a team effort for the Swans - but McVeigh leads the way with 13 disposals including 4 tackles at 85% disposal efficiency AFL Q2 09:55 remaining Geelong 3.4 (22) v Sydney 8.5 (53) Very, very quick one back to Geelong through Hawkins after a clearance from Duncan - they needed that, desperately. AFL Q2 10:01 remaining Geelong 2.4 (16) v Sydney 8.5 (53) Gary Rohan on the lead for the Swans eighth of the evening - and he hits it very nicely. AFL Q2 12:43 remaining Geelong 2.4 (16) v Sydney 7.5 (47) Uh oh. Hawkins gets his opponent in the face with a fist. Cameron Ling says he \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 get suspended in the lead-up to finals - but I\u2019m pretty sure that he will, or should, if the AFL are serious about the crackdown. AFL Q2 13:55 remaining Geelong 2.4 (16) v Sydney 7.5 (47) Heavily umpired game tonight - not a big fan of that. Home crowd thinks they\u2019re getting hard done by - they\u2019re down 10 frees to 7 - but the Swans have been first to the ball. Franklin has had a few chances on the lead, but has dropped the last few that have come his way. AFL Q2 16:32 remaining Geelong 2.4 (16) v Sydney 7.5 (47) Some nice tackling pressure from the Cats to start this quarter, who have slowed things up and focused on pinpoint passes. Eventually they find Murdoch 50m out on an angle - and a very tight angle for a left-footer. Just the one behind - while Gary Rohan limps away from the contest in a worrying sign. AFL quarter-time Geelong 2.3 (15) v Sydney 7.5 (47) I can confirm that Chris Scott actually looks like this right now. AFL quarter-time Geelong 2.3 (15) v Sydney 7.5 (47) Not content with seven goals, Heeney pinpoints Papley 45m out. He can\u2019t convert, but that\u2019s a daunting scoreline to take into quarter time. Another seven goal first-quarter from a Swans outfit playing the Cats. Impressive at the Cats\u2019 home ground. AFL Q1 01:53 remaining Geelong 2.3 (15) v Sydney 7.4 (46) Franklin\u2019s back in the game. All is okay. But he misses from a tight angle. It\u2019s not long before the ball is back deep inside 50. Free kick to Reid who kicks yet another goal for the Swans to reach the seven goal mark. Ominous signs. AFL Q1 03:03 remaining Geelong 2.3 (15) v Sydney 6.3 (39) Franklin takes a contested mark! I\u2019m thrilled. And he picks out Sam Reid 55m out on the lead. Now he wants it back from Reid - that\u2019s more like the Buddy we know. He then hassles McVeigh - who palms off to Franklin - who runs into trouble and gets it back to McVeigh who finds Heeney on the lead. All going Sydney\u2019s way. Except Heeney\u2019s kick. AFL Q1 04:39 remaining Geelong 2.3 (15) v Sydney 6.2 (38) Not a single disposal to Lance Franklin. In full disclosure I am playing a Supercoach final this week, he\u2019s in my forward line and I\u2019m really not happy about it. To repeat, the Swans have kicked six goals and he hasn\u2019t touched it. Meanwhile, the Cats get a 50 to put Zac Smith well within range - from 45 out. He looks to hand it off - and reluctantly takes the kick. It\u2019s a wobbler, and the goal umpire takes out some players. Nice to see the umps get one back. AFL Q1 06:04 remaining Geelong 2.2 (14) v Sydney 6.2 (38) Cats looking somewhat more settled, and Harry Taylor has gone backwards to try and lend a hand to a backline that has endured a barrage. Heeney assists out of a pack to Hanneberry who somehow finds his way through four defenders and winds one back for a brilliant goal. AFL Q1 07:50 remaining Geelong 2.2 (14) v Sydney 5.2 (32) Foray forward by Selwood, who has finally returned to the field after being off for a good chunk of time while the Swans kicked several of those five goals in a row. Now Guthrie lines up for the Cats\u2019 third. He didn\u2019t look confident, and now I see why. AFL Q1 09:11 remaining Geelong 2.1 (13) v Sydney 5.2 (32) Will this be another seven goal first-quarter for the Swans? At least the Cats have scored one this quarter - a feat they didn\u2019t manage in last year\u2019s Preliminary Final. Just as I\u2019m writing them off, Zac Tuohy finds Zac Smith on the lead (not sure he actually meant to kick it there, but nevermind). Finally a second goal to the Cats. AFL Q1 10:18 remaining Geelong 1.1 (7) v Sydney 5.2 (32) 11 inside 50s now to the Swans, and only 5 to the Cats. Tom Papley snaps another roving goal for Sydney\u2019s fifth. AFL Q1 11:23 remaining Geelong 1.1 (7) v Sydney 4.2 (26) The Swans only needed 20 possessions for their four goals. Now that\u2019s efficiency. One man that hasn\u2019t featured for the Swans is Lance Franklin, who is being well held. AFL Q1 12:53 remaining Geelong 1.1 (7) v Sydney 4.1 (25) The Swans are on fire - Hayward snaps a goal for their fourth in six minutes. That one was the result of a turnover in the centre of the ground after the Cats tried to centre. AFL Q1 13:36 remaining Geelong 1.1 (7) v Sydney 3.1 (19) Sam Reid looked to have kicked another for the Swans - from outside 50 - but Henderson gets a touch on it just before the line. Good call from the goal umpire, as it looked a goal before the replay. AFL Q1 13:36 remaining Geelong 1.1 (7) v Sydney 3.0 (18) Just three forward 50 entries for the Swans for three goals - and with that goal they had three goals from five kicks. Unbelievable - that Hawkins free-kick certainly seemed to wrest momentum away from the Cats. AFL Q1 14:20 remaining Geelong 1.1 (7) v Sydney 3.0 (18) Holding the ball against Parfitt goes to Luke Parker who kicks a huge goal from outside 50, off only a couple of steps. AFL Q1 15:08 remaining Geelong 1.1 (7) v Sydney 2.0 (12) Tom Papley gets another for the Swans over the back of the pack - Henderson gave away the free to Reid and Papley took the advantage for a nice, roving goal. AFL Q1 15:30 remaining Geelong 1.1 (7) v Sydney 1.0 (6) #freekickSelwood - Hewett looks to be tagging him. Meanwhile Hawkins lets out some of that aggression by elbowing Kieran Jack in the head, and gets 50 for his troubles. That lets the Swans in - and Sam Reid kicks truly. AFL Q1 16:22 remaining Geelong 1.1 (7) v Sydney 0.0 (0) Early signs aren\u2019t good for the Swans. Cats are dominating disposals at the moment - 17-6, and pressure is right up. They\u2019ve had 4 inside 50s to the Swans\u2019 0. AFL Q1 17:29 remaining Geelong 1.1 (7) v Sydney 0.0 (0) Zak Jones and Tom Hawkins are all up in each other\u2019s faces - you get the sense that Jones doesn\u2019t mind that. Hawkins has the last laugh as he takes a bullet pass from Mitch Duncan, and kicks the opening goal of the night. AFL Q1 18:30 remaining Geelong 0.1 (1) v Sydney 0.0 (0) Guthrie to Scott to Joel Selwood to the top of the square, no mark to Taylor, but our first score of the day is a rushed behind to the Cats. Ball locked up inside the Cats\u2019 forward line. Sirens are sounding, just a minute or so away from the bounce. Tom Lonergan will line up on Buddy Franklin, by the look of it. Swans - via today\u2019s captain Luke Parker - win the toss. Our friends at ABC Grandstand interviewed Mark Blicavs before the game - says he hopes to be back for the first final. Harry Taylor to start forward, according to Scott. Has 16 goals for the season to date - compared to 43 for Hawkins, their leading goalkicker. Fans, however, are ruing the fact that Cameron Ling is in the commentary box for yet another Geelong match. I\u2019d also personally prefer no Wayne Carey either. No late outs for either team - but there is a very important out - and welcome news for all fans. On a much earlier note, does anyone remember the incredible 2005 semi-final between these two teams? Nick Davis kicked an unforgettable goal with just seconds remaining in what was a game for the ages. I\u2019ve found this AFL highlights package, which has unearthed the sign \u2018NICK DAVIS COME TO SAVIS\u2019 ...! Remember the last time these two teams played? It was the preliminary final of 2016 - and the Swans started with a seven-goal-to-none first quarter from which the Cats would never recover. The Swans eventually won by 37 points in what became Jimmy Bartel\u2019s last game for the Cats. For the Cats, Joel Selwood starred with 38 touches, while tonight\u2019s notable absentee Patrick Dangerfield had 39. Familiar names Dane Rampe and Kieran Jack had a big impact for the Swans, and Zak Jones emerged with a staggering 15 rebounds out of defensive 50. A man by the name of Tom Mitchell was also prominent that day, but luckily for the Cats he\u2019s one less player they\u2019ll have to worry about. Preamble Good evening everyone, and welcome to this Friday night AFL live blog of the Geelong v Sydney game from Simonds Stadium. The game itself kicks off at 7:50pm so we\u2019ll be up and running in around 20 minutes. The big question is what difference the absence of Patrick Dangerfield will make to the Cats\u2019 chances of winning against the Swans, who, until last week, were the form side of the competition. The Swans had beaten fellow top-four aspirants GWS and Melbourne in their last month of football before they fell to the rapidly-improving Hawks. As well as Dangerfield, the Cats will be missing Nakia Cockatoo (whose repeat hamstring injury raised questions), Daniel Menzel and Steven Motlop (who were chances to return), which should open the door for the Swans. That said, the Swans have been hit with a big injury of their own - with last week\u2019s milestone man Josh P. Kennedy missing with a hamstring. I would, however, argue that they welcome back a lot more firepower than they\u2019re missing - with Jake Lloyd, Sam Reid, Gary Rohan and out-of-favour Kurt Tippett set to return. I\u2019ll be closely watching how Tippett goes tonight, and it\u2019ll be fascinating to see where he ends up next season. Other players to watch include Geelong\u2019s Tom Hawkins after his mammoth game against Carlton last week. Hawkins had a career-best 27 disposals, and booted six goals playing further down the ground. Wouldn\u2019t they like him to do that every week? I\u2019m guessing he\u2019ll be played more on the wing again today. It was interesting, if unsurprising, to see that his rival coaches voted Chris Scott the hardest coach to play against earlier this week. As always, Lance Franklin should also provide some highlights after he was lucky to escape without suspension for his run-in with retiring former teammate Luke Hodge. It\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of this one for both clubs. Sydney in particular need a win after their loss to the Hawks sent them back into a pack of finals contenders including reigning premiers the Bulldogs, Eagles and Demons (after their own shock loss to the Kangaroos), all of whom are tied on 40 points. The Swans sit sixth only for their superior percentage. The Cats, meanwhile, are only a game adrift of the Crows, and will like their chances of a top-two finish, but also need to consolidate their grip on the top four. They sit just two points above GWS and Richmond, while Port Adelaide are another game behind the Tigers in fifth - themselves a game ahead of the Swans. Back to the Dangerfield thing, though (since we haven\u2019t talked about it enough this week) - do you think the Cats should have challenged? Or is Martin in by a street anyway (and is the clash against Richmond next week more important?) And who should I tip? It\u2019s not easy to go against the Cats at Simonds, but Sydney will be up for the fight. Should be a classic. Kate will be here shortly. In the meantime, this is why the Cats\u2019 star man and no-longer Brownlow hopeful is not playing tonight:"

We\u2019ll never tackle climate change if academics keep the focus on consensus | Political science If so few Americans appear to know the exact level of scientific consensus, why do so many of them think climate change is real and worrisome? The simplest explanation is that the public have already heard enough about the scientific evidence to make up their mind, without being fed increasingly esoteric information about levels of scientific agreement. The real question is not whether the US public think climate change is a problem (most of them do), but what should be done about it. Here it is the crucial non-scientific issues around climate change that should take centre stage.

"7||Juan Mata out to transform football and the world one per cent at a timeJuan Mata is putting together his starting XI. He is in there and there are a few others he thinks he can convince to join him. Some of them you will have heard of, some of them you will not but if this works out the way he hopes, one day everyone you have heard of in football and everyone you have not too will sign up. He believes it could change football for the better at a time when many think it is changing for the worse, the new world-record transfer fee more evidence for the prosecution. \u201cI don\u2019t want these to sound like empty words,\u201d he says. \u201cThe idea is brilliant.\u201d The Manchester United and Spain midfielder is committed to contributing 1% of his salary to a collective fund called Common Goal run by streetfootballworld, a group of 120 charities in 80 countries. The rest of his starting XI will do the same. He aspires for others to choose to join in, until such a point as they do not even have to choose, it becomes part of the system: \u201ca voluntary act ends up built into the structure of the game, something that\u2019s there at all levels,\u201d he says. \u201cIf Fifa and Uefa embrace it, that would be great. \u201cEvery time someone signs for a team, when the salaries are paid, when the accounts come in, at clubs, federations, agents and associations, 1% goes direct to social projects. No one looks at it and says: \u2018Hey, what\u2019s this 1% here?\u2019 because everyone knows. \u201cCollectively football takes on a social responsibility, we set a new agenda, it\u2019s understood that a part of what football generates goes to social projects. If you do it alone it\u2019s hard but if you bring people together \u2026 It can be an engine for good, an act of social awareness within the system. We want to make it the new normal, the standard.\u201d The ultimate end would be 1% of everything that football generates going into a central fund for use in charitable projects. On Thursday, Neymar joined Paris Saint-Germain. His transfer alone would contribute \u20ac2.5m (\u00a32.25m). It starts with a team. \u201cI\u2019m looking for 10 others \u2013 coaches, players, women\u2019s players, people from all over the world: Africa, Asia, Australia,\u201d he says. \u201cNot all team-mates, there\u2019ll be others I\u2019ve played against and footballers who aren\u2019t necessarily top-level. Not just players either \u2013 managers, presidents, clubs and federations. We want to build a momentum that can make a difference.\u201d Mata, who recently returned from the slums of Mumbai, has seen it himself. \u201cIt can sound like a cliche,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s true.\u201d Now he is leading something that he hopes can mobilise and transform the game. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to people already. When you explain it, they understand and most of them are aware of the ability football has to make a difference. But it is true that footballers are mistrustful. They can be mindful of initiatives that didn\u2019t happen or didn\u2019t work. You have to show them that it is real and transparent. You also give them the chance to choose directly where their money goes \u2013 which project and where, what it is that moves them. \u201cYou have to overcome that barrier and that\u2019s the hardest thing. I\u2019m inside, I trust in it. I can talk to them but the only way is to do it, to show them. That way you can convince them. Show them that it works, that it\u2019s a collective project with the potential to improve the game and help a lot of people in an effective and sustainable way. \u201cStreetfootballworld have the experience and structure to make this efficient. That\u2019s fundamental, it can be effective. Then maybe they\u2019ll say: \u2018OK, I\u2019m in.\u2019 \u201cFootball sometimes has a bad reputation. Some of that is deserved \u2026 and some of it isn\u2019t. There is a huge amount of money in the game, it is true. I\u2019m not criticising that. If these salaries and transfer fees are paid it is because they can be. Compared to almost all other areas of society, there is a lot of money [but] when you work in an industry \u2013 any industry \u2013 and you want a pay rise, say, you compare yourself to what others in your industry are earning. \u201cFootball generates a lot of money but there has to be a social responsibility that goes with that. It can positively affect people\u2019s lives. It can help and that helps football too. \u201cPeople look at the negative sides of football but a lot of players and clubs already do a lot. People say: \u2018Oh, they\u2019re only doing it for their image\u2019. I don\u2019t agree: they\u2019re still doing it but mostly it is on an individual level. \u201cThis idea is more global, which gives it more power, more reach and makes it more effective. If we can do something collective and make it part of the system, if it can be structured and effective with a central, shared fund, it can transform football into something more than just a sport. \u201cFootball\u2019s incomparable to anything else \u2013 perhaps only music has that same power to transform society. We have to translate that into something real.\u201d"
"24||My parents\u2019 Dunkirk spirit is probably why I existI went to see Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dunkirk without thinking. \u201cDunkirk\u201d is a name I have always lived with. As a child in England, while the war ended, my family fed me \u201cDunkirk spirit\u201d as if it had been the turning point of the conflict, as well as an exemplary display of humble English greatness. I had the broad factual outline; I knew the numbers, the more or less 330,000 men taken off that stricken beach. But as I was watching the film, I was counting in another way. Dunkirk was evacuated in the first days of June 1940. And now the possibility dawned on me \u2013 I was born on 18 February 1941 \u2013 that I would have been conceived in that dark moment, probably just before the predictable doom that came with the defeat of the British Expeditionary Force in France and Belgium. And that\u2019s a mystery, as if one\u2019s parents are ever anything else \u2013 they are so set on their secrets. You see, they did not get on: my mother admitted that later; my father never addressed the matter, as if \u201cgetting on\u201d was outside his range. I never heard him say he loved anyone. Not that love is an automatic, speaking companion to sex and conception. They must have had sex \u2013 whatever they called it. They were in their 30s still, and they were both attractive and lively. I did gather later that my mother liked sex. She had encountered it somewhere. My father said not one word to suggest he knew about it. I can\u2019t believe he and Mum ever talked about it. But he\u2019d told my mother that he wanted no children, and that if she got pregnant and delivered a child, he would leave her. She did get pregnant (just that once), and he did leave her. After she had been in the nursing home the 10 days required after delivery in 1941, she came home and he was gone. So at some point, as the British army withdrew in Europe, it happened. But my \u201cit\u201d occurred as the British command foresaw the likelihood of losing an entire army, and thus the war. I asked my mother what she thought at the time and she said she had hoped for the best. Good enough, and thank you, Mum. As for Dad, well I can believe, in his silent darkness, that he was saying \u201cwhat the hell\u201d. Why worry about offspring if it\u2019s the end of the world? Did he count on the worst? Or was there even some stray hope in him for furthering the human race in its most forbidding time? Was he defying fate, as well as Hitler? One wants to think one\u2019s father is single-minded and in charge, even if he was a bastard about it. But why should he not have been as confused as Hitler? History can handle Hitler being insane, but confused is harder to deal with. Still, no matter that this is omitted from the film: there are strange mysteries attached to Dunkirk. The Germans argued over what to do at the Dunkirk beaches. The army commander, Von Rundstedt, called for more of the same, an armoured infantry thrust that would obliterate the British and be an emphatic victory. Hitler hesitated. He was not sure tanks could function on beaches. He took G\u00f6ring\u2019s advice that the beach would be better strafed from the air. Was it simply a matter of military indecision, or was Hitler inclined to let the British off? Was he more certain that the Soviet Union was his true enemy? Was he even contemplating a peace with Britain that would free his adventures in the east? Was he nervous of that Channel crossing? He never attempted it. As late as 1945, he liked to say that he had given Britain \u201ca sporting chance\u201d in 1940. Perhaps Hitler needed leeway in his own mind. My father did leave my mother \u2013 he went from south London to beyond the north of the city and he lived with another woman. But he came home every other weekend and he took me to see Chelsea FC, Surrey county cricket club, Reg Harris cycle at Herne Hill and Sydney Wooderson run at White City. There were several years in which I loved him, and then a few more when I made myself look away from his odd routine. He was a tyrant, I learned to see, most of all in his refusal to discuss anything important. But many tyrants are muddles. So I was raised to think of Dunkirk as the time when ordinary people in England got out their boats, sailed across the Channel and brought back four or five, or 45, exhausted soldiers. When I was a child, I met a man who had taken his small yacht to save a few and he recalled that he had just gone, without orders or guidance, in a very unofficial British curiosity. Mark Rylance stands in for such fellows in Dunkirk and he does a good job of it, as if to ask aren\u2019t most Englishmen handy supporting actors, even if they tend to be tightlipped about it to the point of comedy? \u2022 Warner Bros: The Story of an American Movie Studio by David Thomson is published next week by Yale University Press, \u00a316.99."
"11||The story of a sample: how a bank teller's work inspired Kanye and Jay-ZThe Interview, that schlocky Seth Rogen film about Kim Jong-un, already had one unintended consequence: it led to a hacking attack on the film\u2019s studio Sony by a group with alleged ties to the North Korean government. But the film had another, equally surprising ramification, one that has arguably influenced some of the world\u2019s biggest artists. When the film was released in 2014, Ophlin Russell was working at a bank in New Jersey. In another life she had been Sister Nancy, the first female Jamaican dancehall DJ, a trailblazing performer who had played with the biggest soundsystems in the country. Back in 1981, she had written nine tracks that could have been an album. Told that albums usually needed 10 tracks, she wrote Bam Bam, a semi-freestyle sung over Ansel Collins\u2019s 70s dub-reggae staple Stalag riddim. The album was successful in Jamaica, but it was only when she moved to New Jersey in 1996 that she realised Bam Bam had been sampled dozens of times and included on the soundtrack of Hype Williams\u2019s film Belly. But, owing to the vagaries of Jamaican record contracts, Russell had never seen a penny from it. So she took the job at the bank. Then came The Interview, and a typically Rogen-esque scene in which Kim Jong-un strides around naked, soundtracked by Bam Bam. The song shot back to the top of the reggae charts and was featured in a Reebok ad. Russell had had enough. She sought a lawyer, who secured her 10 years\u2019 worth of backdated royalties and 50% of future publishing on Bam Bam, enough for her to give up accounting. With the song back in the public consciousness, Kanye West used it on his controversial track Famous, the song\u2019s sour lyrics about Taylor Swift suddenly segueing into the open heavens of Sister Nancy\u2019s redemption. Russell still wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they would want to sample,\u201d she told the Fader, keen instead to re-record the vocal \u201cwith someone who\u2019s worthy of it\u201d. Step forward Jay-Z. His new track Bam features the original sample, but in the video he travels to Jamaica to record with Damian Marley and Russell, who re-records her vocal: it\u2019s a rawer, pained performance. Afterwards, the three artists talk about what it feels like to create something timeless. \u201cGood music it will last,\u201d she tells them. \u201cEven when I go where I\u2019m supposed to go, my daughter\u2019s gonna say: \u2018That\u2019s mummy\u2019s Bam Bam.\u2019\u201d"
"7||Neymar says 'money was never my motivation as PSG unveil \u00a3198m signing \u2013 as it happenedAnd that\u2019s all. Thanks for reading, those of you that have. Have a lovely day. A summary of what was said: Neymar didn\u2019t make this move for the money, and is actually quite offended that anyone might think the wages of about \u00a3520,000-a-week were the driving force behind signing for PSG. He\u2019s motivated by the challenge. A new challenge. The challenge of winning the Champions League, broadly, but other challenges as well. Challenges. All about challenges. He\u2019s up for making his debut against Amiens tomorrow, but they\u2019ll have to see about that. He wasn\u2019t motivated by being the big star at PSG, rather than playing second fiddle to Leo Messi at Barca. He\u2019s upset that anyone at Barca might be upset with him. Talked about respect quite a lot. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi denied all of this was some sort of revenge for Barcelona trying to nab Marco Verratti. He also reckons PSG will make more money than they spent on Neymar through the various marketing hoopla and so forth. Al-Khelaifi also reckons that simply signing Neymar has put about $500m on the value of the club. So that\u2019s that. Exciting, wasn\u2019t it? No? Which he does with aplomb, as a number of quite stressed sounding photographers scream at him to look in their direction. He then grabs the mic: \u201cOne last thing: Paris Saint-Germain are magic.\u201d And that\u2019s yer lot for the talking. Now, Neymar will hold up his shirt. Did he leave Barcelona because he had a bad relationship with Messi. \u201cNo, there was no pressure at all. He was my role model. I was quite nervous in my first week at Barcelona, but after that I was relaxed. To play with the best is very easy.\u201d He thanks Leo for teaching him and stuff. He\u2019s asked about Ligue 1 being a bit pony. \u201cA lot of people criticise Ligue 1, and I\u2019ve spoken about it with lots of players who play in Ligue 1, and there\u2019s never an easy game here. PSG has the potential to become the greatest club in the world.\u201d He\u2019s anxious to get to know the city. There\u2019s a smashing wine bar somewhere in the 8th Arrondissement, Neysers. Forget the name. Hope that helps. Al-Khelaifi says that before today the value of the club is $1billion, but now it\u2019s $1.5billion. And he expects that to double. Crumbs. He\u2019s asked what success at PSG would look like for him: \u201cI want to write history here. This is the only reason. There are new challenges, and I want to help write the history of the club. Our biggest challenge is the Champions League, but there are other trophies too.\u201d Neymar is asked if there\u2019s an equivalent player to Messi that he\u2019s looking forward to playing with. \u201cHere, it\u2019s the club. It\u2019s not one specific player, it\u2019s everyone.\u201d He then thanks Javier Pastore for handing over his squad number. Definitely JP\u2019s call, that one. Al-Khelaifi is asked if they want to win the Champions League, and then asked who paid the buyout clause: Neymar, or PSG. \u201cIt\u2019s our dream to win the Champions League, and we\u2019ll fight to do so, but we cannot say we\u2019ll win it this year. \u201cWe paid the buyout clause, not Neymar.\u201d Al-Khelaifi is asked if he\u2019s unhappy that Barcelona are complaining to UEFA. \u201cWe only care that we worked in a very transparent way, and we did everything legally. I\u2019m not annoyed.\u201d He\u2019s asked about the manner in which he left, and comparisons to Luis Figo in Barcelona. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing bad. I\u2019m sad that the Barcelona fans think that. I\u2019ve never lacked respect for the fans, and I think every player should be allowed to stay or leave a club. You\u2019re not obligated to stay - if you want to leave, that\u2019s it. Once again, I really want to thank all the Barcelona fans, the club, the players, my friends, and I\u2019m sad that people might think that.\u201d Al-Khelaifi backs this up. \u201cHe was a big gentleman in how he left. We were putting pressure on him but he wanted to leave in the best way possible.\u201d He\u2019s asked when he made his decision. \u201cI thought everything through. I took my decision two days ago. The coach of Barcelona was the first to know - I respect the club, and the coach. It was a difficult decision, but I\u2019m happy with my decision. God has something planned for me.\u201d Neymar is asked about that post where Gerard Pique seemed to suggest he was staying at Barca. \u201cIt was a relaxed moment, we were having lunch together, and he posted the picture. I told him not to post it, because I hadn\u2019t made my decision yet. He wanted to express his feelings, and I respect that.\u201d Al-Khelaifi is asked if there will be more incomings. \u201cYou in the media always want more. We have the best player in the world here, so let\u2019s enjoy this.\u201d \u201cI feel privileged to play alongside the players here. Everyone wants to play with the best, and I think I am.\u201d He\u2019s asked where he will play in the team. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t discussed where I will play. I will play where the coach wants me to.\u201d WILL PLAY IN GOAL IF THE GAFFER ASKS ME TO KLAXON! Neymar is asked about his fitness levels. \u201cI\u2019ve already had a bit of pre-season. I\u2019ve only stopped training in the last two days. I saw the pitch, and I really wanted to put my PSG jersey on and play. I\u2019ll speak to the staff, but I really want to play.\u201d Al-Khelaifi: \u201cHe\u2019s already very handsome, but with the PSG journey, even more so.\u201d Al-Khelaifi confirms there is a buyout clause in Neymar\u2019s new contract, but doesn\u2019t specify the amount. Neymar: \u201cBeing the most expensive player in the world is not a burden. I weigh 69kg. I don\u2019t have a burden on me.\u201d Al-Khelaifi is asked about FFP. \u201cWhen you think about Neymar as a brand, maybe it won\u2019t be so expensive. We\u2019re definitely going to make more money than we spent. We\u2019ve been very transparent from day one about FFP. There\u2019s no problem with that. We have a team working day and night. For anyone worrying about FFP, I say: don\u2019t worry, go and have a coffee.\u201d Neymar is asked if he considered any other clubs, and what he says to those people who said this move is just about money. \u201cThese people don\u2019t know anything about me. Money was never my motivation. I want to be happy, and I want my family to be happy. I\u2019m really sad to hear that people think this way. If it was just about money, I could have gone somewhere else. Al-Khelaifi steps in here: \u201cI can guarantee you he didn\u2019t come for money. He could have got more money elsewhere. He came here for the competition, for the challenge. Today it\u2019s very positive for us, and it\u2019s a great moment for us. It\u2019s headlines everywhere in the world - we\u2019re going to talk about this transfer for a long time. He didn\u2019t come for money, he came to win trophies. Thank you again for coming here Neymar. Al-Khelaifi is asked if this is \u2018revenge\u2019 for Barcelona trying to sign Marco Verratti. Short answer: no, big respect for Barca, etc and so on. A message for Barcelona: \u201cI have nothing to say really - I\u2019m not sad, I\u2019m really happy. I wrote my chapter there - I won some trophies, I did everything I could there, but you can\u2019t make everyone happy. What I want to say to the fans is: thank you for your friendship.\u201d Is Neymar ready for tomorrow? \u201cYes, I\u2019m hungry to play football. I can play tomorrow [against Amiens] - why not?\u201d If PSG didn\u2019t have those Brazilian players, would he have still signed? \u201cYes. The environment here is very positive. I had to think about what I wanted to do with my life. It\u2019s very complicated to think about this. As soon as I made my decision, when I was 100% sure, I communicated that. My heart told me to come to PSG.\u201d Neymar is asked who he spoke to at PSG to make the move. \u201cIt was one of the most difficult decisions I\u2019ve made to move. It wasn\u2019t easy at all to leave Barcelona. I had to think, and re-think, and think again about what I wanted to do. I leave a lot of good friends behind, but that\u2019s football. Of course I would like to thank all my friends at Barcelona, but I felt it was the right time to leave and look for new challenges. I spoke with the Brazilian players at PSG - they are my friends, and I feel at home already.\u201d Why did Neymar sign this year, not last? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to describe or make it as simple. Right now we had all the right ingredients - my heart told me this was the right time to sign for PSG.\u201d Touching stuff. It\u2019s all about his heart, see. Neymar is asked whether being the big star at PSG, rather than Barca, was part of his decision. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not that I wanted to be the big star at Barcelona. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for here. I\u2019m looking for a new challenge, new trophies, and this is what motivates me.\u201d Neymar is asked why he signed, and whether he made the first step. \u201cThis was about ambition. I wanted a bigger challenge, and my heart made this decision and I followed my heart. I want to help this club achieve and win trophies.\u201d Dodged the first move bit, there. Neymar speaks: \u201cThank you Mr President for this new challenge, at PSG, in this wonderful city. I really can\u2019t describe what I\u2019m feeling in my heart. I\u2019m really looking forward to getting started, and to achieve what I want to achieve.\u201d \u201cNeymar is an idol for the whole world,\u201d says Nasser. \u201cHe\u2019s brought so many positive things already. Our fans have always dreamt about having Neymar, and here he is today. Ligue 1 is getting more competitive, and Neymar has signed to win all the trophies we can. We want to win all the trophies we can. Thank you Neymar for coming to PSG, thanks to your family and your staff, and to my staff who worked really hard on this transfer. Welcome Neymar to your new home.\u201d And here he is, walking down the side of the press room, shaking hands and offering some very continental kisses on the cheeks of the assorted people lined up against the wall. It\u2019s him and Nasser Al-Khelaifi, club president and general major domo. We\u2019re on. There\u2019s a snazzy video presentation with Justice-esque dance music, on two screens behind the platform... \u201cHope it\u2019s worth his time playing in such a weak league,\u201d writes Nathan Goodell. \u201cHope he enjoys himself.\u201d Don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth here Nath, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being entirely sincere about that. Someone asked Eddie Jones about this transfer in his own press conference earlier. Eeesh. One of the few benefits of being a rugby coach is that you don\u2019t get roped into nonsense like this, surely. Four minutes late. This is an utter outrage. No, false alarm, not him. But some people are there. People in suits. Oh, there\u2019s Neymar\u2019s dad, who\u2019s snaffled a spot in the very front row. Embarrassing when your old man turns up on the first day of your new job, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s movement. There\u2019s the flashing of cameras. He might be here you know. Incidentally, there\u2019s a slim chance Neymar could make his debut tomorrow. PSG host Amiens in their season-opener at the Parc des Princes, although probably more likely a date for his home bow will be the game against Toulouse in a fortnight. Now, as well as reading my A-grade badinage, you can actually watch the press conference, above. Unless you enjoy journalists milling about and looking up whenever a door opens, there\u2019s not much going on right now, but he\u2019s due to arrive at 12.30BST. Disappointingly his suit looks quite sober. We were promised outrageous. We were lied to. HE\u2019S ARRIVED! That\u2019s Ney-Ney being greeted by PSG grand fromage Antero Henrique. If you\u2019re interested in an intelligent, considered take on things, read on. If not, you can skip this bit. Arsene Wenger said of this move: For me, it is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years. Once a country owns a club, everything is possible. It becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country. \u201cIt also looks like inflation is accelerating. We crossed the 100 million euros line last year and, only one year later, we\u2019re crossing the 200 million line. When you think that Trevor Francis was the first one million pound ($1.31 million) player (in 1979) and that looked unreasonable, that shows you how much distance and how far we have come, how big football has become. It\u2019s beyond calculation and beyond rationality.\u201d More explanation from Neysey, this from his Facebook page: A sportsman needs challenges. For the second time in my life I\u2019m going to be opposing my dad. Dad, I understand and respect your opinion but my decision is made. I ask you to support me as you always have. Barcelona and Catalonia will always be in my heart but I need new challenges. I had the honour to play with the greatest athlete I\u2019ve ever seen and I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t see a better one. Leo Messi became my partner and friend both on and off the pitch. I love you! I formed an attack with Messi and Suarez that has gone down in history. I\u2019ve conquered everything a sportsman can conquer. I\u2019ve lived unforgettable moments! I lived in a city that\u2019s more than a city, it\u2019s a country. I love Barcelona and Catalonia.\u201d Impressive that PSG managed to get all these shirts printed up when the move only happened yesterday, eh? Seems like there\u2019s quite a demand for them, in any case. Who should Barca sign to replace Neymar? Mbapp\u00e9? Hazard? James McClean? Ben McAleer from WhoScored has a few theories though, here: Morning. Well this is all a bit weird, isn\u2019t it. The important thing is that word has filtered through that Neymar is wearing an absolutely outrageous suit. Haven\u2019t seen it yet, but I\u2019m just building some hype at the moment. If you\u2019ve any thoughts on Neymar, his transfer, what this means for PSG, football, life the universe and everything, or indeed his suit: email Nick.Miller@theGuardian.com. A quick reminder of how Neymar explained this move, restraining himself from rolling around on a bed of cash like that bit in Indecent Proposal. He\u2019s Demi Moore. I am extremely happy to join Paris Saint-Germain. Since I arrived in Europe, the club has always been one of the most competitive and most ambitious. And the biggest challenge, what most motivated me to join my new team-mates, is to help the club to conquer the titles that their fans want. \u201cPSG\u2019s ambition attracted me to the club, along with the passion and the energy this brings. I have played four seasons in Europe and I feel ready to take the challenge. From today, I will do everything I can to help my new team-mates, to open up new horizons for my club and to bring happiness to its millions of supporters around the world.\u201d Nick will be here shortly. Meanwhile, read Julien Laurens on what PSG are hoping from their world record signing."
"14||US physician assistant may be forced to quit UK because of visa nightmareAn NHS specialist, his British wife and their three young children have been stranded on opposite sides of the Atlantic because Britain won\u2019t let the couple\u2019s two adopted children into the UK. Patrick Thies, an American orthopaedic physician assistant, may now have to give up his job in Birmingham and return to the US despite the NHS spending \u00a320,000 and nine months recruiting him, after failing to find a suitable candidate in the UK. After accepting the job in January 2017, Thies agreed to move from Oregon to Britain with his British wife, their biological child, Philip, nine, and two adopted children, Benjamin and Edward, aged 10 and 12. Gillian, a chemist who gave up her job to look after the children, was uncertain about how to obtain permanent visas for her adopted children. She sought advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in America, which, she said, told her that because she wasn\u2019t born in Britain, she couldn\u2019t bring her adopted children into the country with permanent visas. \u201cI was told that the fact the boys were adopted meant they were treated differently under immigration proceedings than for any other legal processbut that the boys could enter Britain on visit visas, as they had done many times before, and we could then change the boys\u2019 status while they were all living here,\u201d she said. But when the family arrived at Heathrow in March 2016, the adopted children, Benjamin and Edward, were denied entry because they were carrying visit visas yet clearly intended to remain in the country. The family were detained in the airport, the boys\u2019 passports were confiscated and they were issued one-way tickets back to New York, leaving three days later. \u201cThe officials were seriously insisting that these young children should be separated from their family and put on an airplane which would land in a strange city in the evening where we knew no one ,\u201d said Thies. The family found a lawyer who got the children released from detention at the airport and secured them temporary leave to remain. The family were then advised by the lawyer to apply for the boys to be registered as tier 2 skilled worker dependent children based on their father\u2019s employment contract. The Home Office accepted the application form \u2013 and the \u00a31,800 fee \u2013 only to turn the application down a few weeks later because, they said, the form couldn\u2019t be submitted from inside the UK. \u201cWe\u2019re intelligent, educated people who aren\u2019t trying to deceive anyone and we could just not get it right,\u201d said Gillian Thies. The family then hired Andre Minnaar, an immigration specialist at Cartwright King solicitors. Minnaar advised them to apply again to the Home Office using the boys\u2019 right to a family and private life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights. \u201cI was very confident the application would be successful,\u201d said Minnaar, a specialist in unravelling complex immigration issues. \u201cI regularly make successful applications under article 8 in cases far less clear-cut than this.\u201d The Home Office\u2019s own deadline for application responses is three months. The family, however, had to wait 10 months. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t register with a GP, or apply for a mortgage on the house we wanted to buy here or get our driving licences. Patrick\u2019s father nearly died during this period but we weren\u2019t able to visit him.\u201d When Home Office\u2019s letter finally arrived, however, Minnaar said he was left \u201ctotally speechless\u201d: the boys\u2019 application had been turned down. \u201cThe decision was absolutely extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Home Office\u2019s letter was also astonishing and, frankly, unlawful, because it stated that while it was not their intention to separate the children from the rest of their family, one of the grounds for refusal was that one of the parents could return to the States with the boys and stay in touch with the rest of the family through email and Skype. \u201cIt\u2019s unlawful for the Home Office to suggest modern forms of communication can be used to maintain a relationship between a minor child and a parent,\u201d Minnaar said. \u201cIn addition, the father has a job here and the mother home-schools all three children. If either parent leaves with the two older boys, then it\u2019s a major disruption to their right to a family life.\u201d The Home Office\u2019s letter gave the family two weeks to appeal. An appeal could cost up to \u00a32,500 and take 18 months, during which time the children would have no right to see NHS doctors and have no passports. If the family didn\u2019t appeal, the letter said, the children would have to leave the UK. \u201cWe decided that we had to go right back to the beginning and do what the FCO had told us from the start we didn\u2019t have to do: apply for permanent status for the boys from the US,\u201d said Thies. Patrick took immediate, open-ended leave from his NHS post and booked tickets for him to return to the US with his children on the next flight home 48 hours later. The family then informed the UK Immigration Enforcement office, as required, to arrange the return of the boys\u2019 passports. \u201cThey told us we couldn\u2019t leave in two days\u2019 time because they couldn\u2019t do all the background checks on the children in time for them,\u201d said Thies. Patrick and his sons changed their flight, pushing it back another three days, to midday the following Monday. But again, the UK Immigration Enforcement office said the boys couldn\u2019t leave, on the grounds that there wasn\u2019t enough time to send the boys\u2019 passports to Birmingham International airport. \u201cThere was nothing about this in the letter \u2013 just like there was nothing about the background checks - but we changed flights a third time,\u201d said Thies. In total, the flights and the three changes cost the family around $3,000. Finally back in the US \u2013 with Gillian Thies and the couple\u2019s younger son waiting in the UK \u2013 Patrick Thies started the online application process, at a cost of almost $2,000 per visa. On Wednesday, however, the US consulate told him that the visas would take 12 weeks to process. With Patrick now forced to stay in the US to be with the two older children, there are even fears that he could lose his visa himself if he is gone for too long, Gillian says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said, weeping as she spoke. \u201cWe literally cannot afford for this to go on for another 12 weeks. I\u2019ve never been apart from my kids for more than three days before. I\u2019m totally devastated by this whole experience. I just want my family to be back together again. I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d Andrew Pearson, the executive medical director at the Royal Orthopaedic hospital in Birmingham, who hired Patrick Thies, said he was \u201cvery frustrated and incredibly disappointed\u201d by the Home Office\u2019s refusal to grant the visas. \u201cWe were unable to recruit anyone to do Patrick\u2019s job from within the UK, so if he can\u2019t stay, we\u2019ll have to use locums \u2013 which will cost us at least two times more.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 August 2017. An earlier version said Patrick Thies was an orthopaedic surgeon. This has been corrected to physician assistant."
"9||What is a grand jury and how serious is it for Donald Trump?It has emerged that US special counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington as part of an investigation into potential coordination or collusion between Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. But what is a grand jury, how does it work and what does Trump have to fear? What is a grand jury? Grand juries are used in only a handful of countries. In the US, they are normally made up of about 16 to 23 members of the public rather than the usual 12, hence \u201cgrand\u201d jury. They are held in secret \u2013 the fact that one has been convened is not even officially acknowledged. The Wall Street Journal leaked that one has been set up in Washington by Mueller. It will look into links between the Trump team and Russia to influence the White House election and whether there has been any subsequent attempt to obstruct justice. How serious is this development for Trump? Potentially huge. The grand jury decides whether a case is strong enough to push ahead with an indictment. But one of the main reasons for holding a grand jury is that it is a powerful investigative tool. It can subpoena witnesses and demand the production of documents. Could Trump be called to give evidence? Yes. Richard Nixon was called before a grand jury in 1975 over the Watergate case after he resigned as president. Bill Clinton was president when he testified before a grand jury into the Whitewater real estate controversy. Donald Trump Jr and the president\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, could also be called to testify over their controversial June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer. Why are grand juries feared? Federal prosecutors often treat them as fishing expeditions. Witnesses can be questioned under oath for hours on end, with investigators hoping to trip them up and make them perjure themselves. Unlike in ordinary courts, witnesses are not allowed to have lawyers present. Witnesses have to leave the court to consult with lawyers sitting outside and grand juries are characterised by the time-consuming act of witnesses going in and out. Lawyers warn witnesses not to be lulled into over-confidence by answering a string of soft questions, and implore witnesses to consult with them before answering even seemingly easy questions. Unlike in ordinary courts, jurors are also allowed to ask questions. What is the grand jury investigating? Mueller, appointed special counsel in May following the dismissal of FBI director James Comey, has been investigating since May whether members of the Trump team have lied about links to Russians and whether Trump himself tried to obstruct justice. As of yet, no subpoenas have been received by the president or Kushner. How long will it take for a grand jury to decide if criminal charges should be brought? Grand juries tend to be slow, running for months or even years. How has Trump reacted? He has for months insisted that reports about links to Russia are fake news and told a rally of supporters in West Virginia on Thursday night that \u201cthey\u2019re trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story\u201d.

"7||Who can cut John Terry down to size as he begins Championship adventure?Neil Warnock makes his point with characteristic bluntness. \u201cI just think John Terry has gone completely out of fashion,\u201d the Cardiff City manager says. \u201cThere are not many leaders like John any more or, to give another example, Wayne Rooney. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said Rooney is the type of footballer who would take his shirt and jumper off in the park and put them down as goalposts. John is like that, too. He\u2019s got an effervescence about the game and it\u2019s only when you play against him that you realise what a colossus he is. I wish I could have signed him this summer.\u201d Several others have said the same thing, but it was Steve Bruce who took Terry to Aston Villa and it has been a signing to jolt the club and the Championship at large. High-profile players have dropped down before to English football\u2019s second tier, but Terry\u2019s arrival on a free transfer \u2013 after 19 seasons of leading at Chelsea \u2013 has a more far\u2011reaching feel. Perhaps it is because his blend of achievement and notoriety have made him such a polarising figure. The 36-year-old is an authentic Premier League great, with the silverware and statistics to prove it, but his reputation has been sullied by the well-documented low points. What is clear, as he prepares to make his Villa debut at home against Hull City on Saturday, is that he is under the brightest of spotlights and there is a fascination to see how he fares. \u201cThe thing John is going to have to deal with is that everyone is going to be coming to watch him,\u201d says Michael Dawson, the Hull centre-half, formerly of Tottenham and Nottingham Forest. \u201cThe so-called lower clubs in the Championship won\u2019t have had someone of John\u2019s experience and quality playing at their grounds. Villa will have to deal with that. They are going to have an awful lot of publicity. \u201cJohn will also face players that will raise their games against him. I remember when I was a young kid at Forest and I played against Andy Cole when he was at Fulham. That sort of thing is a dream, coming up against players you\u2019ve watched on Match of the Day. You want to test yourself against the best and everyone is going to want to impress against John.\u201d What has Terry got himself into? He could have signed up for an easier swansong in China or the United States or he could have put his feet up and retired. Instead, he has chosen to attack the remorseless 46-game Championship programme and a division that, by dint of its openness and the size of the rewards on offer for promotion, is often viewed as the most competitive in Europe. A penny for his thoughts at various away grounds would be worth the investment. Villa go to Millwall on the final day. \u201cI was very surprised John moved to the Championship,\u201d says Kevin Phillips, the Derby County assistant coach, who played as a striker for Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion, among other clubs. \u201cI applaud him massively. It\u2019s also worth considering he\u2019ll have to do a lot of commuting, as I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not going to move his family [from Surrey]. I\u2019ve done it many times and it can have its effect. If you\u2019re not having a great time on the pitch and you\u2019re away from home, it can be difficult.\u201d Warnock describes the Championship season as a relentless slog because of the Saturday-Tuesday-Saturday schedule and he makes the point that the travelling is a lot more severe than in the Premier League. Dawson adds: \u201cWhen you have a week off, you don\u2019t know what to do with yourself. It is a lot more physical on your body, so that will certainly be a big ask for John.\u201d Terry made 14 appearances for Chelsea under Antonio Conte last season and one of the big questions will concern whether he can cope with the intensity. Villa have five matches in the opening two weeks of the season, but Terry played 46 games or more in 11 seasons in his career and he can argue he is well-versed in the midweek demands of the Champions League. That said, he will be 37 in December. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy for John and he\u2019ll know that,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot older now. But Steve Bruce will look after him, as the managers I had late on in my career did with me. John knows his own body and if he tells Steve he doesn\u2019t want to train on certain days, I\u2019m sure Steve will let him do what he needs to do. As long as he\u2019s able to perform in matches.\u201d Warnock adds: \u201cI don\u2019t think John\u2019s in for a shock. As you get older, everybody says your legs are this, that and the other, but your mind becomes brighter and it saves your legs a lot of work. John is about talking and organisation, making sure the people around him know what to do. He\u2019ll have had a good pre-season, so he\u2019ll be up to the level of the others.\u201d The greatest, and most obvious, difference between the Premier League and Championship relates to the quality of the strikers. \u201cThey get two chances in the Premier League and take one of them,\u201d Warnock says. \u201cYou probably need five or six in the Championship to get a goal.\u201d Warnock also disputes the notion that Terry faces a more physical challenge in the Championship. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the Premier League, you\u2019re surprised at how physical the strikers are,\u201d he says, with a nod to his time at Crystal Palace, Queens Park Rangers and Sheffield United in the top division. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you don\u2019t notice it as much with the silky football that goes around it. I must admit they can look after themselves in the Premier League.\u201d Dawson adds: \u201cThere are big, physical centre-forwards in the Championship but there is no one more physical than Andy Carroll in the Premier League. I\u2019ve had some good battles with him. You know what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d What Terry will encounter, according to Phillips, are strikers who will work tirelessly to compensate for any shortfall in ability. \u201cThey won\u2019t stop running and they won\u2019t give him an easy time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of thing to what he\u2019s had in the Premier League. People say the Championship is a lot quicker. It isn\u2019t, but it is more direct and the ball goes back to front more. I\u2019ve played in both leagues and there is no difference in terms of the fitness side of it and the tempo of the game.\u201d Bruce talks of having experienced some dark days at Villa last season, mainly away from home when, to use his words, the players \u201cdid not put their boots on\u201d. They were bullied too regularly and the mentality needs to change. \u201cThat\u2019s why John is here \u2013 simple,\u201d Bruce says. He has named him as the club captain. Warnock suggests Bruce would see a lot of himself in Terry in terms of how he made the most of his talent as a central defender through sheer force of personality. There is another parallel. When Bruce left Manchester United in 1996, at the age of 35, he dropped into the second tier to play for Birmingham City. Thereafter, he moved to Sheffield United as the player-manager \u2013 his first step into management. Terry wants to get into management, too \u2013 in the fullness of time \u2013 and his experiences at Villa will accelerate the learning curve. For now, though, his old-school leadership will find its purpose in a playing role. He intends to prove it can still be on-trend."
"1||Conor McGregor's sparring partner quits, calling Mayweather build-up a 'fiasco'Questions about Conor McGregor\u2019s preparations for his fight with Floyd Mayweather have surfaced again after his sparring partner, the retired boxer Paulie Malignaggi, said he will leave the Irishman\u2019s camp and described the event as a \u201cfiasco\u201d. Malignaggi told ESPN he was angry that photos had emerged of McGregor getting the better of him in the ring. One photo shows McGregor apparently sending the former world champion to the canvas. Malignaggi insists he was pushed, and wants video of the session to be released to show what he says is the full story. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to become the story, and that\u2019s what this has turned into,\u201d Malignaggi told ESPN on Thursday. \u201cI won\u2019t release any information about his game plan or what he\u2019s working on \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t do that. But this has become a fiasco. It\u2019s a circus. \u201cAnd I do want that sparring video released. The UFC\u2019s PI definitely has that video. I understand it can\u2019t come out now, but Conor, if you have any balls, release what really happened.\u201d Malignaggi added that he and McGregor had \u201ca mutual respect inside the ring\u201d and that his departure was related to matters outside the ring. McGregor, famed for his UFC career, faces Floyd Mayweather in a boxing fight on 26 August in Las Vegas. The fight has been criticized as a money-making stunt: the 40-year-old Mayweather is considered one of the greatest fighters of all time, while McGregor has no professional boxing experience. Both men could make over $100m from the fight. However, the run-up to the bout has received negative attention. McGregor called Mayweather, who is African American, \u201cboy\u201d in their first press conference, a comment widely seen as racially insensitive, including by Mayweather himself. The American went on to call McGregor \u201ca faggot\u201d. Tickets for the fight at Las Vegas\u2019s T-Mobile Arena, which cost up to $15,000, have also sold slowly."
"6||Surveillance used to be a bad thing. Now, we happily let our employers spy on usEvery technical innovation has brought with it a new way of watching over workers. CCTV allowed nosy managers to keep an eye on the shop when they were not around. Software systems have been used to track the number of keystrokes an administrator makes a minute, how often they move their mouse or how long they spend lurking on the web. GPS technology has enabled transport firms to track their employees and contractors as they move around the city. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is now being used by companies to follow their employers around the building, recording who they interact with and registering if they spend too much time lingering in toilets. Biotracking technology allows bosses to record the number of steps an employee takes in a day, their heart rate, what they eat and drink, how much sleep they get and even their hormone levels. Neurotechnology, such as increasingly cheap EEG scanners, enables overly inquisitive firms to monitor the activity in their employees\u2019 brains. Now, companies are literally getting under their employees\u2019 skin. Last month, a small Wisconsin-based vending machines company called Three Square Market shot to global prominence when it offered employees the opportunity to implant a small device about the size of a grain of rice under their skin. This RFID-enabled device allowed its proud new owners to do things such as log into their computer, open doors and purchase food in the office cafeteria with a flick of the wrist. Nearly half of the company\u2019s 85 workers had the device implanted when the firm held a \u201cchip party\u201d. The vending machine company is not alone in using this technology. Back in 2006, a North American surveillance firm implanted chips under two of its employees\u2019 skin. A Stockholm-based technology incubator called EpiCentre offered similar chips to members earlier in the year. There is also a large community of bio-hackers around the world who experiment with implants. Bio-hackers have implanted magnets under their skin, digital earbuds and even a small antenna. Not to be outdone, the US military is now developing brain implants, which they hope will be in use by 2019. It is not particularly surprising that companies are looking at new ways of tracking their employees. Bosses have always wanted to keep an eye on them. What is really surprising is how enthusiastic employees are about being watched through ever more invasive technology. In the past, surveillance was seen as something bad. It intruded on our lives. We were often willing to put up with it because it provided benefits, such as security. But that didn\u2019t mean we liked it. Now it seems we no longer see surveillance as an intrusion on our privacy. Today, many employees think the latest forms of digital surveillance are \u201ccool\u201d. At the Wisconsin vending machine company, they volunteered to be chipped. So did the entrepreneurs based in the Stockholm tech hub. This enthusiasm is shared by the tens of thousands of employees around the world who have voluntarily started wearing fitness tracking devices their firms have given to them. We must remember these trackers use the same GPS technology that prisoners are forced to wear. This raises the question as to why we are so positive about having our boss watching over us using the latest technology. Most of these new technologies offer some functional benefits. By having an implant, workers at Three Square Market don\u2019t have to remember their passwords. But lurking under these are more existential motives. These new technologies offer us an opportunity to understand ourselves. By generating an endless flow of data about our bodies, we feed our narcissistic urge to explore the most fascinating thing in our lives: ourself. These technologies also offer the opportunity to improve ourselves. By collecting data, there is a hope we can improve ourself and live up to widespread demands to be fitter, healthier and more productive. And these new technologies offer us an opportunity to expose ourselves. They give us the chance to keep track of our bodies and then put that on display for everyone to see. Think about your Facebook friends who regularly upload the data from their most recent exercise routine. They are sharing intimate information in the hope of getting a few likes in return. A similar motive is probably at play when employees share intimate information with their employer \u2013 they want to feel like someone out there is watching them and taking an interest in their life. Somebody cares. Existential issues aside, there is a wider economic imperative driving the expansion of digital surveillance in the workplace. We live in an age of \u201cbiocratic capitalism\u201d where the economy is based around harvesting one commodity \u2013 data about our everyday lives. This personal data is absolutely central to the business models of many big digital companies such as Google and Facebook. We have been gradually trained to gleefully give away our personal data to these firms, who then use our data to target advertising back at us. More recently these firms have used it to build up massive databases that will provide a platform for these companies to play a key role in providing public services in the future. Implanting chips under the skin of employees is just one more way that firms can continue to generate the resource they need most \u2013 data about ourselves. Having been trained to hand it over without thinking by the web giants, it should be no surprise we don\u2019t object when our employers want the same access. \u2022 Andr\u00e9 Spicer is professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City University, London"
"10||Dearborn, Michigan: a city divided by religion, race and classIn the past 12 months the city of Dearborn, Michigan, has been thrown into conflict: conflict powered by fear, ideology and identity politics \u2013 and, at its heart, what it means to be an American. Dearborn, home to the largest mosque in north America, is a place of apparent contradictions. It is simultaneously a sleepy, affluent suburb and yet also the subject of rumours about Isis terror cells and sharia law. This film takes us into the lives of five very different citizens who are caught in the crossfire, from Muslims to Christians, citizen militias to university graduates. For all, their American identity is paramount. As they grapple with questions of religion, race and class, do these separate communities have more in common than they realise? Dearborn, Michigan is commissioned by the Guardian in collaboration with The Filmmaker Fund.

"7||Premier League 2017-18 preview No10: LiverpoolGuardian writers\u2019 predicted position 5th (NB: this is not necessarily Andy Hunter\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips) Last season\u2019s position 4th Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 12-1 It is an infuriating trait of the Premier League era for Liverpool that a season of genuine progress often precedes a reversal but J\u00fcrgen Klopp is convinced the cycle will be broken. The extra demands of Europe and a patient, high-risk transfer strategy that has yet to pay off provide counter arguments to the Liverpool manager\u2019s belief. They should not distract from what is at Klopp\u2019s disposal, however. Consistency, he has insisted, will ensure Liverpool do not merely flirt with a title challenge this season. Many, though not all, of the pieces are in place. As was the case last summer, before he guided Liverpool back into the top four for the only second time in eight seasons, Klopp has been unperturbed by the external anxieties that surround the club\u2019s transfer business when compared with rivals in the top six. Tottenham Hotspur are, of course, the notable exception. At this point in the window the anxiety is understandable. The final steps Klopp had envisaged for the coming campaign have proved the most difficult to take. RB Leipzig have been as good as their repeated word that Naby Ke\u00efta is not for sale despite Liverpool submitting club record offers of \u00a357m and \u00a366m for the midfielder and his openness to the move. Interest in Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has unfolded how Anfield officials always suspected it would: with Real Madrid lining up a staggering offer for the Monaco forward. And there was the \u201caborted\u201d move for Virgil van Dijk, a setback that established the tone of a difficult window for Liverpool and showed Klopp that even the briefest visit to Blackpool \u2013 where he allegedly tapped-up Southampton\u2019s team captain \u2013 can have damaging repercussions. Liverpool\u2019s interest in the commanding Holland international is not over despite publicly withdrawing from the race for the \u00a360m-rated defender when Southampton reported them to the Premier League over an illegal approach. A preliminary investigation ended without charge because of a lack of evidence and Liverpool will return for Van Dijk should Southampton indicate they will part with their wantaway centre-half. The pursuit of Ke\u00efta is expected to be parked under \u201cnext summer\u201d when his \u20ac55m release clause kicks in. Add into the mix Barcelona\u2019s interest in Philippe Coutinho and a sense of unease is legitimate, although there are still four weeks for Van Dijk to arrive, others to follow and what has already taken shape at Anfield this summer signals improvement ahead. Liverpool have the will and the money to sign van Dijk and Ke\u00efta but not a way to break the resolve of Southampton and Leipzig respectively. That was always the inherent risk in Klopp targeting a few top-class upgrades to elevate Liverpool from fourth into title contention, rather than the wholesale changes that have characterised recent summers in L4. He has also been reluctant to consider alternatives as the waiting game over van Dijk demonstrates. The success of that approach will be revealed once the transfer window closes and Champions League commitments arrive for a squad that benefited from a European-free season last time out, providing the play-offs are navigated successfully later this month. For a manager who craves consistency and prizes stability, however, the existing foundations are more important, and encouraging, than what is currently out of reach. Klopp has a settled squad attuned to his methods, no disruption to contend with and an improved luxury of options in the final third. Liverpool would relish an opportunity in the Champions League against opponents who, like Bayern Munich in the Audi Cup on Tuesday, are more open to attack than many in the Premier League. The pursuit of quality over quantity is another indication of recent progress at Anfield. Liverpool possess a squad fit for Champions League qualification, one that finished above Arsenal and Manchester United last season and produced some exhilarating performances when emerging as Chelsea\u2019s closest challengers before Christmas. Title pretensions evaporated at the turn of the year when Liverpool, to use their manager\u2019s argument, lacked the depth to deal with a hectic fixture schedule, a run to the League Cup semi-finals, injuries and Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s departure to the Africa Cup of Nations. The squad needs strengthening in central midfield and central defence but it has undoubtedly improved. Reinforcement so far has mainly centred on Liverpool\u2019s strongest department, attack, where Mohamed Salah has joined for a club record \u00a336.9m from AS Roma and Dominic Solanke has arrived in search of greater opportunity than he found at Chelsea. A tribunal will decide the compensation fee payable on a striker who starred in England\u2019s triumphant Under-20s World Cup campaign and has shown in pre-season that his involvement will not be confined to the under-23s team, as Klopp initially suggested. Salah has shone in pre-season, three years after rejecting a proposed \u00a38m move to Liverpool in favour of an ill-fated spell at Stamford Bridge. The Egypt international has played on the right of Klopp\u2019s forward line, with Man\u00e9 working his way back to full fitness, and his speed, work rate and end product have all impressed. The prospect of Salah and Man\u00e9 terrorising defences from all angles and feeding off the intelligent awareness of Roberto Firmino, is tantalising for Klopp. \u201cMake other teams crazy with the qualities we have,\u201d the manager has said. Equally comfortable on the left, Salah ensures Liverpool will not be as reliant on Man\u00e9 for pace and gives Coutinho licence to dictate play from a deeper position. The Anfield club are adamant the Brazil international will not be sold this summer despite continued interest from a Neymar-less Barcelona. In Coutinho, Salah, Man\u00e9, Firmino, Daniel Sturridge \u2013 who had earned Klopp\u2019s approval with his sharpness this summer only to suffer a thigh injury while scoring in the 3-0 defeat of Bayern \u2013 Solanke, Divock Origi and the fit-again Danny Ings, Liverpool boast a formidable range of strikers. They will be needed. Klopp\u2019s side frequently faced, and toiled against, opponents who sat back en masse and played on the counterattack last season. It was not only a recurring theme at Anfield, with teams prepared to concede ground at home to combat Klopp\u2019s style. Jordan Henderson\u2019s ability to stretch and switch the play was missed after he suffered another debilitating foot injury. Liverpool\u2019s captain can ill-afford a repeat while their manager requires more throughout central midfield, as the Ke\u00efta quest indicates. Klopp has identified where improvement will be necessary for his team to make an impact in Europe and satisfy the club\u2019s desperate craving for a first league title since 1990. \u201cOur biggest challenge is to be stronger defensively as a team, to be more concentrated, more focused in situations,\u201d he said this summer. \u201cWe know what the problem is.\u201d He said the same last season, too, but set pieces and counterattacks continued to cost Liverpool. Competition for James Milner\u2019s place at left-back has arrived in the form of Andy Robertson, an initial \u00a38m signing from Hull City. Central defence remains a concern without van Dijk and, despite his excellent form at the tail end of last season and impressive reaction to the arrival of Loris Karius, Simon Mignolet faces a challenge to retain the No1 spot all over again. Injuries, a major factor in January\u2019s downturn according to Klopp, would have an impact on a squad facing a more demanding workload this season. Liverpool must also show greater mental resilience under pressure if, as their manager has stated, it needed only a draw at Sunderland to sow doubt in his players two days after they had beaten Manchester City at Anfield. A striking feature of Klopp\u2019s Liverpool reign so far has been the extent of individual improvement, Adam Lallana being a prime example, and with no significant departures to contend with the manager can be confident of maintaining that upward trajectory. He also has youngsters of genuine promise who have been carefully integrated into the first-team spotlight such as Ben Woodburn and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Rhian Brewster, a 17-year-old striker acquired from Chelsea, could be next. Nathaniel Clyne may be an England regular but he faces a fierce challenge for his right-back role this season from Alexander-Arnold. The 18-year-old from Liverpool has made no secret of his ambition to captain his boyhood club and has seized the chance afforded by Clyne\u2019s injury in pre-season. Liverpool are blessed with pace, attacking prowess, stability and a balanced squad. Whether they will have the required quality in central midfield and defence, however, may rest on breaking the resolve of Southampton and RB Leipzig."
"24||Gemma Cairney: \u2018Mum was a tenacious party girl, and gave me a gaggle of honorary aunties\u2019We moved from Birmingham to Balham, south London, when I was two. The only hazy memory I have of my biological father was when I was three: a smiling character said hello to me at Balham station, and I said hello back. We walked on. I never feel like there was a day when I found out that Vincent, the dad in my house, wasn\u2019t my real dad, so there was no real shock, like in the films. When my mum, Hazel, told me the man at the station was my real dad, I just didn\u2019t care. My mum was 25 when she had me in 1985. But she had lived around the world: she\u2019d been a nanny in Paris and gone to secondary school in New York. She had been to international school in Geneva, but at the same time had very Glaswegian, pioneering parents. I remember holidays at my grandad\u2019s in Menorca. Aged three, I jumped into the pool when my mum and dad weren\u2019t looking. Then I saw a massive hand coming through the water. It was my dad, who can\u2019t swim, pulling me out. Doubtless he saved my life, but my biggest emotion was fear of how much I was going to get in trouble for doing exactly what I was told not to. I credit my mum for being a tenacious, fun, party girl who exposed me to this gaggle of honorary aunties, this hardcore troupe of women, who inspired me because they were fun. They were feminist, all looked different, had different fashions, did different jobs, had different love stories. They used to do the babysitting run: there was a wine bar down the road called Goblin\u2019s, and my mum and her friends would be a revolving door of babysitters throughout the evening, because a lot them were single parents. So me and the other kids would be at our family flat, and the babysitters would be like a tag team, which meant the babysitter would be a few cocktails down from 11pm onwards. My mum and Vincent split up when I was seven. I love him: he\u2019s my dad. He\u2019s just a cool guy \u2013 he\u2019s warm, he\u2019s funny. He\u2019s a musician and plays the electric guitar, which he taught himself, at church. I was nine when we moved to Horsham, West Sussex, because my mum got a good job and we could go to a good school. Looking back, how hard it must have been for her to make big decisions as a single parent: how to do the best for your kids without having someone to discuss it with. I remember being pissed off, and I didn\u2019t speak for a week when we moved. I thought: \u201cAs soon as I can get back to London, I will.\u201d I went to the Brit school at 16, travelling from Horsham to Croydon every day. I had read about it in Bliss magazine. I was the only person at audition who had travelled without a parent. I moved to East 15 Acting School, in Loughton, Essex, when I was 18. I was independent and living in a flat, and so excited, finally this grownup-ness I had been planning for had happened. In my early 20s, I took a short radio course, and I didn\u2019t have any money. I have never had any means of support in times of need. But I enjoy finding a way. If someone or society or a rule is telling me no, I\u2019m determined to mould and bend into a shape that says yes. \u2022 Open: a Toolkit for How Magic and Messed Up Life Can Be by Gemma Cairney, is published by Panmacmillan, \u00a312.99."
"24||My life in sex: 'He\u2019s my 50th sexual partner'Sex now is pretty much the best it\u2019s ever been. We\u2019re trying for our second baby, so it\u2019s not frequent: every two days when my fertility app says I have a chance of conceiving, and almost never the rest of the time. When we do have sex, though, it\u2019s amazing. I think it\u2019s something to do with being emotionally in tune, and so hopeful of creating a new life each time. Our lives are incredibly busy: we have a toddler, we both work full time, I study and my husband does extra freelance work. We\u2019ve been together for seven years and we\u2019re past the first heady days of not being able to keep our hands off each other. But being with someone you love and who loves you, and whom you trust completely, is a wonderful aphrodisiac. He rarely initiates sex, so I feel completely in control. We\u2019ve been quite adventurous over the years. We\u2019ve visited a few sex clubs (where we had sex in front of other people, but only with each other) and I even hired an escort to join us for one of his birthdays. He\u2019s my 50th sexual partner. Unlike many other people, he\u2019s comfortable knowing that. However, looking back, I can see that much of it was due to low self-esteem \u2013 I craved the feeling of being wanted. I met most men online and had many one-night stands. I was mostly hopeful of things progressing to a relationship, but they rarely did. I\u2019ve been left with lots of amazing stories \u2013 some funny but many sad, involving unsafe situations and intense regret. I\u2019m very lucky to have met my husband, and I\u2019m so happy at the idea that I don\u2019t ever have to have sex with anyone else again. \u2022 Each week, a reader tells us about their sex life.

Two Nazis worrying about the prevalence of skulls on their uniforms leading to the brilliantly plaintive question: \u201cHans, are we the baddies?\u201d The funniest TV show I\u2019ve ever seen The Thick of It is my favourite TV show of all time. I\u2019ll never get over the fact I wasn\u2019t in it. Ever. The funniest hairstyle I\u2019ve ever had When I was 12, I was obsessed with New Kids on the Block. They all had rat tails, those awful long braids, worn at the base of the neck. I had long hair, so decided one day to cut it into a bob but leave one, long strand of hair down the back so I could plait it and look like Jordan Knight. Boys would tease me and pull it like it was a lamp cord, so I cut it off pretty soon after. The funniest book I\u2019ve ever read I, An Actor. A mock-autobiography by a fictitious actor called Nicholas Craig, but actually written by Nigel Planer of The Young Ones. If Withnail had written an autobiography, this would be it. At one point, Planer uses the word \u201ctruth pumping\u201d as a way to describe what actors do when they\u2019re doing their best, showing-off acting. It\u2019s a phrase I now use a lot to describe bad acting. The funniest word Brustwarze. It\u2019s the German word for \u201cnipple\u201d and, literally translated, means \u201cbreast wart\u201d. There couldn\u2019t be a less erotic word for what is arguably a pretty erotic part of the body. The funniest person I know My comedy partner of many years, Lorna Watson. She makes me howl like no one else. The funniest item of clothing I\u2019ve ever owned When I was in Munich a few years ago I bought a full dirndl [German national dress]. I\u2019d just gone through a break-up and inexplicably thought I\u2019d cheer myself up by dressing like a Bavarian barmaid. I\u2019ve never worn it.

"24||Generation rent: why I\u2019ll never live in a four-bed family semi in Somerset with a private annexeI\u2019ve been paid a visit by Auntie B, a delightful woman I\u2019ve known my whole life, though I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019re related. She just wants what\u2019s best for me, she says between insults, and she and my mother are getting concerned about my childlessness. \u201cYour age and no baby \u2013 very sad!\u201d she says, like my own pocket Trump. Mum nods emphatically, and I can tell from her eyes that she\u2019s about to say something she knows will annoy me: \u201cWhen I was your age\u201d \u2013 Boom! There it is! \u2013 \u201cI\u2019d had three children.\u201d I assume the usual positions: I say I have a rented room in a shared property that\u2019s no place for a newborn, then pirouette into a point about rental insecurity. I\u2019ll finish with \u201chome ownership is a distant dream\u201d jazz hands, after a quick twirl of \u201csocial housing waiting lists\u201d. And I remind her that my partner\u2019s parents own a house they\u2019ve said we can have when you-know-what happens; that I\u2019m sure I have very strong ovaries that will last that long; and is that the time? Got to go, no, of course I\u2019m not changing the subject. As an encore, Mum tells Auntie B my priorities are all wrong. What she doesn\u2019t realise is, I dream of being able to afford a family home, such as this \u00a3395,000 four-bed semi in Somerset: near enough to a city (Bath) for work, far enough for peace, plus an annexe with its own entrance. Perfect for when I\u2019m older. Or that inevitable moment when my own kids can\u2019t get on the housing ladder."
"15||Women in NHS ambulance service 'hounded for sexual favours'Female NHS ambulance staff say they have been hounded for sexual favours in return for promotion. The allegations, which include \u201chighly sexualised gazing\u201d in front of patients and \u201csexual predators\u201d who \u201cgroomed students\u201d for sex, emerged in a report which revealed widespread bullying at South East Coast ambulance service NHS foundation trust (Secamb). Researchers were told that sexualised behaviour was embedded in parts of the management structure. The independent report was commissioned by Secamb after concerns were raised in the trust\u2019s staff survey and a report was published last year by the NHS regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC). More than 40% of about 2,000 staff who took part in the research said they had experienced bullying in the last 12 months. The 69-page report, produced by Prof Duncan Lewis from Plymouth University, detailed \u201covert and covert sexualised behaviour\u201d extending from former senior leaders through to frontline managers and the general workforce. Some of the senior staff interviewed believed those responsible had left the trust, but the report said researchers were told the culture was embedded at management level in some areas of the organisation. \u201cFor example, female staff talked about sexual favours being sought in return for career progression whilst others were hounded by managers seeking sexual favours for personal reasons. \u201cSeveral female staff felt that such behaviours were the norm, with some stating \u2018my arse was slapped regularly\u2019 and others who felt they were demeaned by highly sexualised gazing in front of colleagues and even patients. \u201cSome female respondents talked about \u2018sexual predators\u2019 among male colleagues who \u2018groomed students\u2019 for sexualised ends. Some managers felt there was a history of comments being turned to lewd remarks but slowly these were being addressed.\u201d Researchers were said to be shocked at the number of staff reporting poor behaviour. \u201cThe researchers were extremely distressed to hear of the experiences of several female Secamb employees,\u201d it said: \u201cThe trust may not of course be aware that such a culture exists as employees are often extremely fearful of speaking out against such practices. \u201cHowever, as has been shown time after time, ignorance is no defence and too many British institutions have demonstrated failure to take matters seriously when it comes to sexual abuse.\u201d The report said the trust\u2019s executive must now commission further investigations and take action \u201cas an urgent priority to protect employees who are living in fear daily\u201d. Secamb, which covers Kent, Surrey, Sussex and north-east Hampshire, was put into special measures last September after the CQC ranked it inadequate. In 2015, it was embroiled in a scandal over its delays and misreporting of 999 attendance figures. As an \u201cexperiment\u201d, Secamb delayed sending help for some calls to allow extra time for patient assessments but it ended in failure."
"26||Bernie Sanders aims to inspire revolution among young adult readersA generation of young readers raised on the struggle for justice imagined in The Hunger Games and Divergent can welcome a new superstar YA author aiming to inspire a revolution in the US\u2019s contemporary dystopia: Senator Bernie Sanders. The Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution is out on 29 August. According to publisher Henry Holt, the former Democratic candidate for the US presidency calls for young people \u201cto fight for a progressive economic, environmental, racial and social justice agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides healthcare for all\u201d. In a foreword, Sanders points out that, in his campaign for president, he received more votes from young people than Donald Trump\u2019s and Hilary Clinton\u2019s combined, and that \u201cin virtually every state primary and caucus, we won the overwhelming majority of young people \u2013 black, white, Latino, Asian American, and Native American\u201d. \u201cIt is my observation that the current generation of young people is the smartest, most idealistic, and least prejudiced generation in the modern history of the United States,\u201d writes Sanders in the guide, an adaptation for young people of his bestselling adult book, Our Revolution. \u201cThis is a generation that is prepared to think big and move this country in a very different direction than we have been traveling for years. It is especially prepared to reject the value system espoused by Donald Trump and the rightwing reactionaries in Congress who support his ideas.\u201d Sanders told Teen Vogue that his book would expose young people to \u201can unusual political campaign, the excitement of politics and what being a progressive is all about\u201d, adding that \u201cthey have a responsibility to participate in our democracy and to help create a government that works for all, rather than just the few\u201d. The senator is not the first political leader to attempt to reach younger readers. In 2010 Barack Obama published Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters, a illustrated guide to \u201cgroundbreaking Americans\u201d and ideals that have inspired the nation. Donald Trump has yet to publish his thoughts on politics for the children\u2019s market."
"22||England's Lionesses smash TV audience record in Euro 2017 semi-finalEngland\u2019s crunch Euro 2017 semi-final against Holland drew the biggest ever UK audience for a women\u2019s football match. A peak audience of 4 million tuned in to Channel 4, only to see the Lionesses crash out of the tournament with a 3-0 loss to the host country. The match easily beat the previous record of a peak of 3.3 million, which was set on Sunday for England\u2019s quarter-final against France. Thursday night\u2019s game drew an average audience of 3.4 million viewers as fans hoped to see the Lionesses move to within one game of becoming the first senior England side since Sir Alf Ramsey\u2019s World Cup class of 1966 to win a major football tournament. The match drew more than double the average audience of Channel 5\u2019s Celebrity Big Brother, which aired from 9pm to 10pm. It also proved more popular than BBC1\u2019s Panorama special on the RSPCA and ITV\u2019s Inside the London Fire Brigade and James Martin\u2019s French Adventure. It even held its own against the big beasts of the weeknight schedule, soaps Emmerdale and EastEnders, which drew audiences of 4.5 to 5 million. Viewing of the game peaked at 9pm when England were still very much in the match, trailing by one goal. Minutes later they conceded a second. From this point viewers began to drift away with just over 1 million still watching after the Dutch went 3-0 ahead with an own goal in the dying seconds. Channel 4 is jubilant over the ratings success of Euro 2017\u2013 the broadcaster has previously had huge viewing success with its gamble on the London 2012 Paralympic games \u2013 but will rue the missed opportunity of another record night had England made the final. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted so many tuned in to follow England\u2019s magnificent effort during this campaign \u2013 who knows how many might have tuned into the final had the Lionesses made it, but sadly it wasn\u2019t to be,\u201d said Stephen Lyle, Channel 4\u2019s commissioning editor, sport. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no doubt that the women\u2019s game is compelling sport, and just as heartbreaking as the men\u2019s game.\u201d The game drew a record crowd for women\u2019s football in the Netherlands, but that is likely to be eclipsed by the home country\u2019s final against Denmark this weekend."
"14||Wish you were here: Europol releases set of postcards in bid to catch criminalsFrom the ski runs of Austria to the frites of Belgium and crisp pilsner lager of the Czech Republic, new postcards published on Friday do a convincing job of selling the delights of the countries they are championing. Perhaps that is just as well, as the set of 21 cards is part of a summer campaign launched by the pan-European police agency, Europol, to help national forces lure in and catch up with some of Europe\u2019s most elusive fugitives. While it is unlikely the the cards will successfully pull on the heart strings of homesick fugitives, all of whom are subject to a European arrest warrant, the crime agency hopes they will be shared on social media. \u201cWhile most of us are enjoying a well-deserved summer break, criminals are not taking time off from crime,\u201d Europol said in a statement. As well as illustrating the delights of EU member states, the new postcards feature the personal details and photographs of Europe\u2019s most wanted, for whom traditional investigative measures have so far not led to locating the suspects, Europol said. \u201cCiao Marco,\u201d says the message from Italian policeto Marco Di Lauro, 37, wanted for murder, drug trafficking and robbery. \u201cDon\u2019t you miss the taste of real Italian cuisine prepared with love by someone who really loves you? Come back to the sun-kissed shores of Italy for a truly authentic (food) experience that you\u2019ll never forget.\u201d The Austrian police write on their postcard to Tibor Foco, 61, who is wanted on suspicion of murder: \u201cServus Tibor. We haven\u2019t seen you for a while! We have one more space left on our next ski trip. Please come back to enjoy our beautiful Alps.\u201d The Hungarians tempt Viktor Mikl\u00f3s, 38, wanted on drug charges, with: \u201cKedves, Viktor. We know you liked spiced stuff, so we have prepared a very special goulash for you. Come back. \u00dcdv\u00f6zlettel, the police.\u201d To Artur Nawrocki, 38, wanted for drug trafficking in Belgium, the local police write: \u201cBelgian fries are the best and we know you miss them. Come back to enjoy them \u2013 we\u2019ll have a nice surprise in store for you.\u201d Scotland Yard, however, plays it straight in a message, accompanied by a picture of a traditional red phone booth, to David Daniel Hayes, who is accused of multiple child sexual offences. \u201cHi David. We have been trying to get hold of you because there is still so much to discuss. Please get in touch soon!\u201d Europol said: \u201cHoliday destinations have proven to be popular hiding places for criminals on the run ... The more the postcards are seen, the better the chance of police locating these criminals and putting them behind bars.\u201d Social media is increasingly a key part of the agency\u2019s efforts to aid the work of domestic police forces across national boundaries. A website specifically focusing on Europe\u2019s most wanted, launched in early 2016, has had more than 2.5 million unique visitors. Europol said 36 criminals who had featured as most-wanted fugitives had been arrested, at least 11 of whom were apprehended as a result of information provided by the public through the site. One of those caught after featuring on Europol\u2019s list was Salah Abdeslam, who was arrested in Molenbeek, Brussels, on 18 March 2016 after being on the run for 126 days following the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015."
"25||iPhone 8: everything we know from Apple's big software leakA week of analysing a leak from Apple has revealed many details about what the company\u2019s next iPhone will be like: from facial recognition to a smart camera system and a screen that fills the front. Two developers, Steve Troughton-Smith and Guilherme Rambo, spotted that Apple had made what appears to be an internal software update for employees testing Apple\u2019s upcoming HomePod smart speaker available on the public internet. The update was meant to only be distributed inside Apple and so contained many elements concerning the next version of the iPhone, codenamed D22, which could end up being the iPhone 8, \u201ciPhone X\u201d or \u201ciPhone Pro\u201d. All-screen design The most obvious change will be a complete redesign of the front of the iPhone. Files associated with Apple Pay within the HomePod firmware revealed a silhouette of the design, which shows a screen that reaches from the top to the bottom of the device, with small bezels all the way around and a notch in the top of the screen likely for the earpiece speaker, front-facing cameras and sensors. Further digging suggests that the status bar, instead of being a black bar all the way across the top of the screen integrating the cut-out for the sensors, will likely be white or mimic the colour of the rest of the screen, making it stand out at the top of the device. Where\u2019s the home button? Rambo discovered code that appears to confirm that Apple\u2019s long-standing physical home button, which has been in place since the iPhone\u2019s launch in 2007 and gained a fingerprint sensor underneath it with the iPhone 5S in 2013, will no longer feature \u2013 at least not for the D22 iPhone. Instead it appears the new iPhone will have a virtual home button, possibly called the home indicator, which will be hidden during some activities. Google\u2019s Android uses a similar system for its home, back and overview buttons, which sit in a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen and are hidden when viewing full-screen content such as videos, photos and games. Apple\u2019s iOS already supports a virtual home button as part of its accessibility features, which replicates the function of the home button and is used as a replacement by those worried that the physical button would wear out, or for those phones where the home button becomes non-functional. Probably no under-screen fingerprint scanner Apple has long been rumoured to be working on a version of its Touch ID fingerprint sensor that works from underneath the screen, as revealed by patent applications. Until now it has has been embedded in the home button, but a screen-embedded fingerprint scanner would make a spot on the screen read fingerprints for authenticating payments and unlocking the device. Samsung was also expected to integrate a similar technology into the Galaxy S8, which ditched the firm\u2019s traditional physical home button with fingerprint scanner for a virtual home button and a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone. Technology firm Qualcomm, which produces processors, modems and other chips uses extensively throughout the smartphone and tablet ecosystem, including most of the top smartphones with Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, recently announced it had an \u201cultrasonic\u201d fingerprint scanner capable of working through a display, thick glass, metal or even under water. Troughton-Smith, however, says that such a device in the next version of the iPhone is highly unlikely. Maybe next year. Facial recognition It appears that the D22 iPhone will not have Touch ID, at least on the front of the device. Instead it seems Apple will install facial recognition in the top notch of the device. Codenamed \u201cPearl ID\u201d, the face recognition feature will be part of the new \u201cBiometricKit\u201d system and will likely use an infrared-based system similar to Microsoft\u2019s Windows Hello facial recognition in its Surface computers. Apple\u2019s chief rival Samsung used an IR-based system for its iris-scanning technology, which was first introduced with the ill-fated Note 7 and continued in the popular Galaxy S8. Further digging revealed some code that seems to suggest that \u201cFace ID\u201d, or whatever Pearl ID eventually ends up being called, will even be used to confirm purchases with the company\u2019s contactless smartphone payment system, Apple Pay. SmartCam Computational photography is the next stage in camera development \u2013 where advanced algorithms take the input of one or more physical camera lens and use it to create an image that looks better than what could be achieved with a raw, unprocessed image. For instance, Google\u2019s highly rated HDR+ for the Pixel takes between two and 10 under-exposed shots and combines them into one photo for brilliant results. Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 Plus combines photos from the two cameras with different focal lengths on the back to create a lossless zoom as well as using depth information to artificially create out-of-focus background or bokeh effects for portrait shots. For the next version of the iPhone, and possibly for iOS 11 as a whole as it is rolled out to older devices, Rambo found mentions of a SmartCam system, which will likely tune camera settings based on the scene it detects. Previous versions of iOS have included apparently more basic versions of the same thing for automatic exposure. Some of the scenes mentioned include \u201cbaby\u201d, \u201cbright stage\u201d, \u201cdocument\u201d, \u201cfireworks\u201d, \u201cfoliage\u201d, \u201cpet\u201d, \u201csky\u201d, \u201csnow\u201d, \u201csport\u201d, \u201csun rise and sunset\u201d and \u201cpoint light source\u201d. Augmented reality photography The HomePod firmware also reveals some features and functions of Apple\u2019s big push into augmented reality, which the company announced during its World Wide Developers Conference this year, for the D22 iPhone. References to a depth-sensing front-facing camera were found, likely part of the sensing system used for face recognition, which will enable new camera effects and tricks, including something called \u201cARFaceAnchor\u201d. Snapchat and many other programs, including the camera apps of Sony smartphones, have long provided masks and other augmented-reality features that can be applied to faces. It appears Apple will ship a system that recognises the face in a selfie and can apply AR effects. Further digging also revealed a series of lines of code that appear to reference expression detection, tracking the position and shape of the mouth, among other things. Alternatively they could reference AR modifications that can be applied to faces, such as big lips or massive comedy eyes. Despite rumours of a delay, Apple is expected to announce new iPhones at its yearly September event, with chief executive Tim Cook hinting during an earnings call that everything was on track. We\u2019ll find out exactly what it looks like then. Apple declined to comment. 13 things Apple should automate after driverless cars"
"8||Rights groups condemn 'shameful' Russian crackdown on web VPNsCritics have accused Russia of attempting to neuter the internet as a political threat after the authorities launched a crackdown on virtual private networks (VPNs). VPN services and apps allow internet users to appear as if they are in a different country to the one in which they are physically located, which helps with anonymity and also enables users to access sites blacklisted in particular countries. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, signed a law on Sunday to impose tougher restrictions on VPN providers, forcing them to comply with Russia\u2019s list of blacklisted sites, in what was ostensibly a move to help fight extremism. The same law also requires messaging apps to be linked to phone numbers, making it easier to identify users. \u201cI think the regulation is a bit outdated and very difficult to implement,\u201d said Andrei Soldatov, the author of a recent book on the internet in Russia. \u201cBut this law is still very dangerous, because it means all the internet service providers will be in violation, and this will be a good tool with which to put pressure on them.\u201d Russia\u2019s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, maintains a list of thousands of blacklisted websites. The VPN provider Private Internet Access, which removed its servers from Russia last year after some were seized by the government, said it would not comply with any such order. \u201cThe newly signed law will likely be used to compel VPNs to go against their ethos and censor what the Russian government wants,\u201d it said in a blog post. China has also begun a crackdown on VPN services in recent months. The Russian initiative is different to the Chinese law in that it does not ban VPN products. Soldatov said the legislation would be unlikely to convince international VPN providers to comply, and said the Tor software, which allows anonymous browsing, was \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d and very difficult to control. He said to really ensure Russians were unable to access blacklisted sites, the government would have to implement a much more sophisticated filtering system. Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who exposed US government surveillance programmes and now lives in Russia, criticised the law. \u201cBanning the \u2018unauthorized\u2019 use of basic internet security tools makes Russia both less safe and less free. This is a tragedy of policy,\u201d Snowden tweeted. He added: Rights groups also criticised the move. \u201cAnonymity protects the rights of internet users and freedom of expression online,\u201d said Yulia Gorbunova, a Russia researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThese laws negatively affect the ability of tens of millions of Russians to freely access and exchange information online.\u201d Amnesty International said it was the latest step in a \u201cshameful campaign\u201d against the internet in Russia, and compared the legislation to Chinese bans on VPNs. In July it was reported that the Chinese government had ordered the country\u2019s three telecoms companies to block access to VPNs completely by February next year. Last weekend, two VPN providers said Apple had told them it was removing their apps from its app store in China."
"6||England\u2019s women\u2019s football team are the sporting heroes the country needs\r\nEngland has produced some great sporting heroes in our time. Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill; Jonny Wilkinson; the guy who chases the wheel of cheese down the hill but is somehow above eating it; Gunnersaurus. As a nation, we\u2019re probably guilty of idolising our sportsmen too much \u2013 we give them knighthoods, we let them host Homes Under the Hammer, we bestowed upon Mo Farah the grand tsar of Quorn, an honour previously only given to elder statesmen and war heroes. That said, there is one group of sportspeople who need to be celebrated and honoured as soon as possible: the England women\u2019s football team. And when I say honoured, I mean honoured. I want to go full diamond jubilee for these women. I want commemorative plates, I want commemorative mugs, I want a limited edition of Jordan Nobbs Toilet Duck, for getting your basin as clean as the volley she hit against Scotland. I want Steph Houghton\u2019s face carved on to the white cliffs of Dover. Sorry, Mother Nature, but did you single-handedly keep France at bay in the quarter-finals? No? Didn\u2019t think so. \u201cBut this England team hasn\u2019t won anything,\u201d I hear you clamour. \u201cIn fact, they went out against the Netherlands in the semi-finals in a 3-0 defeat. I had invited people round to watch and it actually ended up a bit of a downer.\u201d To those people I say: English football is not about great victories. It is not about the trophies. It\u2019s not about playing \u201cgood\u201d football. If it was, we would all have asked the German FA to take over many years ago. It is about those small seconds of glory where you think anything is possible, it\u2019s about that little bit of hope before it\u2019s dashed on the rocks by Dani\u00eblle van de Donk. And before last night, this England team provided those golden stories: Millie Bright and Houghton throwing themselves at the French harder than Neymar did; Fran Kirby ripping Spain apart so brutally it would make Michael Howard blush; and Jodie Taylor destroying Scotland so thoroughly she\u2019s less welcome north of the border than Theresa May. And regardless of how badly England did on Thursday night, they\u2019ve still reached their second semi-final in three years: if the men\u2019s team were doing this well, they\u2019d have changed the name of our currency to Raheem Sterling. I hate to bring up the men\u2019s team. That\u2019s been a general policy since Monday 27 June 2016, especially when talking to Icelandic people. But think back to the last time you watched them and felt an actual affinity with them. For me, it was France 1998. I was nine years old, and I was convinced all football players were my best friends. I didn\u2019t want to be Paul Scholes, I wanted to hang out with him \u2013 I wanted to play Crash Bandicoot with him, quote Simpsons episodes at him and ask whether the other players made fun of him for his ginger hair. As I grew up, I realised I couldn\u2019t be best friends with Paul Scholes: for one, he earned in one week what my dad earned in a year, and second the age gap would have made getting into nightclubs really difficult and I didn\u2019t want to cramp his style. This England team is the first one I\u2019ve watched since 1998 where I\u2019ve felt that kind of excitement. I\u2019m not saying I want to be best friends with all the England squad \u2013 although Mark Sampson, if that is an official role, I\u2019m your man. I mean they just feel so much more real than any other team \u2013 the excitement, the pain, the sacrifice is all magnified by 10 because you know that, unlike many male players, they haven\u2019t been in an academy since they were eight, given media training since they were 11 and promised multimillion-pound contracts before their 16th birthday. There are some sobering stories that have come out of this and previous England teams \u2013 Casey Stoney coming out, Fara Williams being technically homeless while playing for England, Karen Carney speaking frankly about her battles with self-harm. That is not to say that they are all saints but they are open and more truthful than many of the male players are allowed to be, and it makes following their ride to stardom so much more exhilarating.

"18||\u2018Valencia\u2019s cathedral is home to the holy grail\u2019: novelist Jason WebsterValencia is a jewel that foreigners are only beginning to discover. For years it was Spain\u2019s unloved sister: in 1970, critic Kenneth Tynan dubbed it \u201cthe world capital of anti-tourism\u201d. To be in Valencia \u201cis to be permanently 20 minutes this side of suicide\u201d, one visitor told him. All that, thankfully, has changed, with a thorough face wash and big building projects. The gothic architecture is world class, and the Mercado Central knocks the socks off Barcelona\u2019s La Boqueria market. Valencia cathedral is home to the holy grail (as verified by a Pope or two). I was drawn here by love \u2013 my wife is from the area, and later my two boys were born here. It has become my Spanish hometown: the people are friendly, the food is spectacular and the weather divine (if a little sticky in summer). What more could you want? Mention Valencia to a Spaniard and usually three things come to mind. First, the pyromaniac spring festival known as Fallas. This is a bacchanalian orgy of fire and noise in which, for five days, the streets turn into a kind of battleground and sleep becomes purely theoretical. Second, paella: Spain\u2019s national dish was born in the rice paddies south of the city, and is treated with a near-religious respect by Valencians. And third, political corruption, of which there seems to be an endless supply, making the city an ideal backdrop for my crime novels. One of my favourite areas is El Cabanyal, the old fishermen\u2019s quarter, where many of the terraced houses have brightly coloured tile facades. Several years ago it was in danger of being pulled down. Now, with a new city government in charge, the threat has lifted and money is being spent on doing up the neighbourhood \u2013 though this brings other challenges, such as gentrification. For now, it retains much of its original character. Casa Monta\u00f1a bar and restaurant has a vast wine cellar, and is the best place to eat there. Cabanyal beach is a short bus ride from the centre and lined with bars, restaurants and ice-cream parlours. La Pepica is a traditional paella place and a Valencian institution. The walls are covered with photos of celebrities who have eaten there, including an occasional royal and the ubiquitous Ernest Hemingway. The rice dishes are second to none. In the 1930s Valencia was an important centre for Spain\u2019s anarcho-nudist movement. (I\u2019m not making this up.) Today, quieter and more picturesque beaches are often clothes-optional. They tend to be the more remote beaches, and so have a more \u201cnatural\u201d feel (in every sense). One of the most accessible is El Saler, south of the city, with protected dunes, lifeguard, showers and a relaxed atmosphere. The only worry is jellyfish. El Garb\u00ed mountain, a few miles to the north, provides wonderful views. You can see the city, the market gardens surrounding it, and the Gulf of Valencia, from Montg\u00f3 mountain in the south, and far into Castell\u00f3n province. I once spotted a tiny patch on the horizon, which I subsequently realised was Ibiza. This area is the setting for much of my latest novel, Fatal Sunset. Valencia\u2019s heat and noise can sometimes be overbearing, so this is my favourite spot for cooler air and a quieter perspective. \u2022 Jason Webster is author of Fatal Sunset (Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a316.99).

"14||UK undercover police inquiry names three spies who infiltrated leftwing groupsThree undercover police officers who spied on political groups have been identified by a judge-led public inquiry into undercover police operations. The spies infiltrated leftwing groups as far back as 1968, amid heightened establishment fear that radical groups would challenge the status quo. One spy operated under the fictitious name of \u201cRick Gibson\u201d between 1974 and 1976. He infiltrated Big Flame, a leftwing group, and the Troops Out Movement, which campaigned to end British rule in Northern Ireland. According to police, Gibson became a leading member of the south-east London branch of Troops Out Movement. His deployment was cut short after activists from Big Flame became suspicious. They confronted him after discovering a death certificate that appeared to show he had died as a young child. Gibson, who has since died, claimed he was wanted by police and had used the false identity to escape arrest. He disappeared shortly afterwards, leaving the activists sceptical but unable to prove conclusively that he was an agent of the state. The use of dead children\u2019s identities was commonly used by undercover officers to develop their false identities. The second spy used the fake name of \u201cDoug Edwards\u201d during his deployment between 1968 and 1971. He infiltrated a series of anarchist and leftwing groups, including the Independent Labour party. According to police, this gave him the credibility to become the treasurer of one of the groups, the Tri-Continental. During his mission, he told the activists he was a long-distance lorry driver. Edwards told the inquiry: \u201cSome of the people in these groups were really nice, pleasant, intelligent people. They were different politically in their views, but in this country you can have different political views.\u201d Edwards also said that during his deployment, he went to the wedding of one of the activists he was spying on. He gave him \u201cone of those fancy tin openers and he seemed quite pleased with it \u2026 I had to go because I was invited; I could hardly avoid going.\u201d The third spy went under the name of \u201cJohn Graham\u201d between 1968 and 1969, when he infiltrated protest groups opposed to the US war in Vietnam. He pretended to be a leftwing activist in the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign, attending meetings in Kilburn and Willesden in London and going on demonstrations. He also spied on another leftwing group, the Revolutionary Socialists Students Federation. According to police, his fake identity was more rudimentary than the undercover officers who were later deployed to infiltrate political groups \u2013 \u201che grew a beard and simply \u2018turned up\u2019\u201d at the meetings of the groups. He told activists that he delivered cars from one garage to another for a living. The disclosure of the trio on Thursday is significant as it is the first time that the public inquiry \u2013 now being led by Sir John Mitting \u2013 has identified undercover officers. The spies who have been previously been exposed were unmasked following investigations by campaigners and the media. Since 1968, at least 144 undercover officers were sent by police to spy on more than 1,000 political groups. The progress of the inquiry - set up in 2014 - has been delayed as police are arguing that many of the undercover officers must be kept secret. Mitting is considering whether to accede to a raft of police requests. On Thursday he said he had decided that a further three undercover officers who have died, and seven officers who managed or assisted the covert operations, will be identified \u201cin due course\u201d. \u2022 If you would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian\u2019s SecureDrop service (see how here)."

"2||London should lead in showing electric cars will not tackle air pollutionWith more and more of the world\u2019s population living in cities, we need to get urban transport right. That means making sure that people and goods can move around easily and cheaply. It also means ensuring that city transport systems don\u2019t damage people\u2019s health, as diesel and to a lesser extent petrol are currently doing in London and other UK cities. Air pollution in our cities regularly contravenes EU limits. London breached its annual air pollution limit for 2017 in just five days. Decreasing vehicle emissions while maintaining or improving commuter journeys is a complex challenge and decisions made today about our transport systems will influence generations to come. The government set out its plans to tackle the problem last week. The main plank of its strategy is a commitment to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040. The ambition to switch to electric vehicles is a signal for real change and is the direction we need to go, despite the associated upheaval and challenges in the form of extending battery range and life, ensuring adequate and conveniently positioned charging stations, generating enough clean electricity and overcoming the general lack of knowledge about the cost and convenience of owning an electric vehicle. The government\u2019s plan, however, does not go nearly far enough. Our cities need fewer cars, not just cleaner cars. One issue is that electric vehicles will not sufficiently reduce particulate matter (PM), the other toxic pollutant emitted by road transport. This is because PM components include not only engine emissions, but also a contribution from brake and tyre wear and road surface abrasion. Governments don\u2019t currently pay much attention to PM, but it is in fact highly polluting, with strong links to cardiopulmonary toxicity. As London continues to grow in size and population, even zero-emission vehicles are not the complete answer to poor air quality. The capital\u2019s population grew at twice the rate of the UK as a whole between 2011 and 2015. The safe and efficient movement of people around the city can only be achieved through a clean and expanded mass transit system served by buses, overground trains and the underground system - and as much active transport in the form of walking and cycling as is feasibly possible. We need to give people more and easier options to get about without necessarily owning a car and using it for short journeys. Encouragingly, attitudes toward car ownership do appear to be changing. Younger Londoners are increasingly replacing little-used vehicles with car club membership and ride-sharing apps. But moving toward such an overhaul in our capital\u2019s transport system and public mindset depends on continued and exacting scientific research and its translation into realistic and effective policies. We must also champion the value of exercise and continue to make public transport the convenient option. Nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will live in urban areas by 2050. How we manage and plan for growing urbanisation will be key to so many global aspirations from improving air quality and human health, maintaining economic success and combatting climate change. If cities everywhere should be promoting healthier and non-polluting transport policies, it is particularly important that London does. The city is hugely influential. Where it leads, others will follow. Frank Kelly is professor of environmental health at Kings College London, chair of the government advisory committee on the medical effects of air pollutants and a member of the Centre for London\u2019s commission on the future of the capital\u2019s roads and streets."
"2||Electric cars are not the answer to air pollution, says top UK adviserCars must be driven out of cities to tackle the UK\u2019s air pollution crisis, not just replaced with electric vehicles, according to the UK government\u2019s top adviser. Prof Frank Kelly said that while electric vehicles emit no exhaust fumes, they still produce large amounts of tiny pollution particles from brake and tyre dust, for which the government already accepts there is no safe limit. Toxic air causes 40,000 early deaths a year in the UK, and the environment secretary, Michael Gove, recently announced that the sale of new diesel and petrol cars will be banned from 2040, with only electric vehicles available after that. But faced with rising anger from some motorists, the plan made the use of charges to deter dirty diesel cars from polluted areas a measure of last resort only. Kelly\u2019s intervention heightens the government\u2019s dilemma between protecting public health and avoiding politically difficult charges or bans on urban motorists. \u201cThe government\u2019s plan does not go nearly far enough,\u201d said Kelly, professor of environmental health at King\u2019s College London and chair of the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, official expert advisers to the government. \u201cOur cities need fewer cars, not just cleaner cars.\u201d Ministers were forced to produce an air pollution plan after being sued twice in the courts over illegal levels, but it was criticised as \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d and \u201clacking urgency\u201d by city leaders and \u201cinexcusable\u201d by leading doctors. The government\u2019s own research showed the fastest and most cost-effective measure to cut the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution largely caused by diesel engines is to charge dirty cars to enter urban areas. Electric vehicles emit no NO2 but do produce small particle pollution from the wear on brake discs and tyres and by throwing up dust from roads. A recent European commission research paper found that about half of all particulate matter comes from these sources. \u201cWhile governments don\u2019t currently pay much attention to particulate matter, it is in fact highly polluting, with strong links to cardiopulmonary toxicity,\u201d said Kelly in an article in the Guardian. The Royal College of Physicians estimates that 29,000 people die early each year from particle pollution, more than the 23,500 premature deaths attributed to NO2. The combined total is 40,000 because some people are harmed by both pollutants. NO2 levels are illegally high in most urban areas, allowing legal action to be taken, but small particle levels are not. The legal limit in England and Wales for particulate matter is two and a half times the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) guideline set in 2005 and which has already been adopted in Scotland. London\u2019s air is above the WHO limit but below that in England and Wales, said Kelly: \u201cSo it\u2019s legal but unhealthy.\u201d In any case, both the UK government and the WHO agree there is no safe level of small particle pollution. Kelly said enabling people and goods to move easily and cheaply around cities such as London is crucial, especially as their populations are growing fast, and backed better public transport as the solution: \u201cThe safe and efficient movement of people around the capital can only be achieved through a clean and expanded mass transit system \u2013 served by buses, overground train and the underground system \u2013 and by as much active transport in the form of walking and cycling as is feasibly possible.\u201d \u201cEncouragingly, attitudes toward car ownership do appear to be changing, with younger Londoners increasingly replacing little-used vehicles with car club membership and ride-sharing apps,\u201d he said. Oliver Hayes, Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, said: \u201cElectric cars are critical in the fight against climate change and deadly air pollution, but they\u2019re not a panacea. We must now build the infrastructure that reassures ordinary people that cycling and walking is safe, and invest in public transport that is consistently clean, cheap and reliable.\u201d A government spokeswoman said: \u201cReducing roadside pollution is a priority for this government \u2013 which is why we have committed \u00a33bn to help towns and cities take action against harmful [NO2] emissions caused by dirty diesels. Next year the government will publish a comprehensive Clean Air Strategy which will address other sources of air pollution.\u201d Kelly said the traffic pollution problems facing the UK affect cities around the world, which are also increasing rapidly in size. \u201cBy 2050, nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s population will live in urban areas. How we manage and plan for growing urbanisation will be key to so many global aspirations from improving air quality and human health, maintaining economic success and combatting climate change.\u201d"
"12||New season of Will and Grace: face slaps and Trump gags feature in first trailerThe first trailer for the new season of hit New York sitcom Will and Grace has arrived - with dramatic face slaps and snarky retorts announcing its return to NBC on 28 September.

The 16 Emmy award winning Will and Grace ran for eight seasons between 1998 and 2006 and returned with a 10-minute episode in September 2016. Launched at the height of the US election campaign, the short episode touched on the ascent of Trump. Speaking to the Guardian in March, Mullally said the new season would reference the current political climate. \u201cHow could it not? The main goal is to be funny, first and foremost, but the writers are so smart, they\u2019ll find ways to comment on what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThe show was never overtly politicised, it was just topical. We didn\u2019t hammer home that Will and Jack were gay \u2013 they just were gay, among other things. Viewers enjoyed it as entertainment, but maybe some teeny part of it got a little toehold in the backs of their minds and some change grew out of that.\u201d"
"25||Stephanie Daman obituaryMy friend and colleague Stephanie Daman, who has died of cancer aged 56, was a formidable force in tackling the UK\u2019s critical cybersecurity skills gap. She was also a founder member of the Get Safe Online scheme, a source of factual information on online safety, which kick-started her passion to educate and prepare the country for the risks of the future. Stephanie cared passionately about the industry she worked in, which protects individuals and companies from unintended or unauthorised access to their computers. From 2012 until her death, she was chief executive of Cyber Security Challenge UK, a not-for-profit, government-funded organisation that finds talented people and encourages them into jobs in cybersecurity. She became one of the most influential women in the field, her opinions valued by those in government, industry and academia alike. Stephanie worked with colleagues to develop new qualifications, enabling those with few or no academic achievements to get a foot on the ladder, and to overcome barriers of discrimination in industry. Born in London and raised in Surrey, the elder daughter of Ann (nee Broadway) and David Daman, Stephanie attended Rosebery grammar school for girls, in Epsom. After gaining a degree in history from King\u2019s College London, Stephanie joined the civil service and the MoD, where she became interested in security and risk. Her postings included the British embassy in Washington DC and the Cabinet Office in London. In 2003 she joined HSBC, where she became head of group information risk and began to show the leadership qualities for which she became well known. Then, at Cyber Security Challenge UK, she oversaw a step change in the variety of activities it undertook. She introduced programmes for universities and schools, encouraging more young people to take Stem subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). She also ensured that the UK had a key role to play in the development of Europe-wide competitions designed to get other countries thinking creatively about security. Outside work, and living in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, she was an avid tennis player, who enjoyed country walks, and travelled widely with her daughter, Katrina. Stephanie saw the best in everyone and believed that each person could make a difference in the world, given the right opportunities. She is survived by Katrina, the daughter of her marriage to Charles Bott, which ended in divorce."
"6||Editing the human genome brings us one step closer to consumer eugenics\u201cHope for families with genetic conditions\u201d, and \u201cscientific breakthrough\u201d: that is how headlines are proclaiming a project that modified human embryos to remove mutations that cause heart failure. But anyone who has concerns about such research is often subjected to moral blackmail. We are regularly lumped in with religious reactionaries or anti-abortion campaigners. I am neither. If you peel away the hype, the truth is that we already have robust ways of avoiding the birth of children with such conditions, where that is appropriate, through genetic testing of embryos. In fact, the medical justification for spending millions of dollars on such research is extremely thin: it would be much better spent on developing cures for people living with those conditions. It\u2019s time we provided some critical scrutiny and stopped parroting the gospel of medical progress at all costs. Where genetic engineering really can do something that embryo selection cannot is in genetic enhancement \u2013 better known as designer babies. Unfortunately, that\u2019s where its real market will be. We have already seen that dynamic at work with the \u201cthree-parent IVF\u201d technique, developed for very rare mitochondrial genetic conditions. Already, a scientist has created babies that way in Mexico (specifically to avoid US regulations) and a company has been set up with the aim of developing the science of designer babies. Scientists who started their careers hoping to treat sick people and prevent suffering are now earning millions of dollars creating drugs to \u201cenhance cognitive performance\u201d or performing cosmetic surgery. We already have consumer eugenics in the US egg donor market, where ordinary working-class women get paid $5,000 for their eggs while tall, beautiful Ivy League students get $50,000. The free market effectively results in eugenics. So it\u2019s not a matter of \u201cthe law of unintended consequences\u201d or of \u201cscaremongering\u201d \u2013 the consequences are completely predictable. The burden of proof should be on those who say it won\u2019t happen. Once you start creating a society in which rich people\u2019s children get biological advantages over other children, basic notions of human equality go out the window. Instead, what you get is social inequality written into DNA. Even using low-tech methods, such as those still used in many Asian countries to select out girls (with the result that the world is short of more than 100 million women), the social consequences of allowing prejudices and competitiveness to control which people get born are horrific. Most \u201cenhancements\u201d in current use, such as those in cosmetic surgery, are intended to help people conform to expectations created by sexism, racism and ageism. More subtly, but equally profoundly, once we start designing our children to perform the way we want them to, we are erasing the fundamental ethical difference between consumer commodities and human beings. Again, this is not speculation: there is already an international surrogacy market in which babies are bought and sold. The job of parents is to love children unconditionally, however clever/athletic/superficially beautiful they are; not to write our whims and prejudices into their genes. It\u2019s for these reasons that most industrialised countries have had legal bans against human genetic engineering for the last 30 years. Think about that for a moment: it\u2019s pretty unusual for societies that normally put technological innovation at the centre of their policies to ban technologies before they\u2019re even feasible. There have to be very good reasons for such an unprecedented step, and it\u2019s not to do with \u201cprotecting embryos\u201d. It\u2019s to do with the social consequences. Genetically modified crops are a good comparison. Faced with a similarly irresponsible absolutism from the scientific community \u2013 as well as with the obvious competition for fame and profit \u2013 the green movement and the left felt they had to take the issue of GM food into their own hands. Now it looks like it\u2019s time to campaign for a global ban on the genetic engineering of people. We must stop this race for the first GM baby. \u2022 Dr David King is a former molecular biologist and founder of Human Genetics Alert, an independent secular watchdog group that supports abortion rights"
"9||The Muslim Americans leading the push to 'stand up and be leaders' in politicsMore Muslims must seek public office as Donald Trump \u201cfans the flames of Islamophobia\u201d, according to Andr\u00e9 Carson, who is one of just two Muslim members of the US Congress. The congressman from Indiana spoke as Muslim communities across the US voice fears of a growing climate of Islamophobia under the US president. Carson criticised Trump in an interview with the Guardian, adding that while there is \u201cno easy answer\u201d, misconceptions over the Islamic faith perpetuated by the administration should serve as motivation for more Muslims to engage in the political process. \u201cI think they\u2019re concerned about [Trump] really encouraging the darker elements of our society to become more pronounced in their intolerance and their bigotry,\u201d Carson, a Democrat, said of the feeling among the Muslim communities he represents. \u201cI think that\u2019s disappointing, but I think there\u2019s a silver lining,\u201d he added, \u201cand that silver lining suggests there\u2019s an increase in interest in American political life.\u201d Carson made the comments as Guardian Films publishes a film examining community relations in Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to the biggest mosque in North America. The film features five citizens from different backgrounds, from Muslims to Christians, citizen militias and young university graduates, and explores how they see American identity, and grapple with questions of religion, race and class. While there is not comprehensive data to provide a number of Muslims who currently hold elected office in local and state bodies around the US, religious discrimination and an increase in hate crimes has spurred more Muslims to explore politics, according to some groups that focus on representing Muslims in the government. Informal surveys indicate New Jersey leading the way, with at least 14 Muslim Americans currently in public office. After Trump signed an executive order seeking to ban immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries, one advocacy group, Jetpac, launched a formal campaign designed to encourage more Muslims to run for local office and adopt a more active role in community organizing. American Muslims in Michigan have gained significant success in running for elected office, and Abdul El-Sayed, the former Detroit health commissioner, recently announced a run for governor in 2018. El-Sayed, who would become America\u2019s first Muslim governor if elected, said: \u201cThe vote for the current president was not a vote of inspiration. It was a vote of fear and cynicism. We have to believe in the unifying idea of us \u2013 the people.\u201d Deedra Abboud, US Senate candidate for Arizona In Arizona, Deedra Abboud, an attorney and community leader, recently announced a run for the US senate in the 2018 midterm elections. Abboud, a Democrat who was subjected to a torrent of online Islamophobic abuse after announcing her candidacy, echoed Carson\u2019s call for more Muslims to run for office. In a comment for the Guardian, Abboud wrote: \u201cIt is true that Muslims in America are facing a tidal wave of discrimination, flowing forth from the policies of the current administration and affecting every corner of American society. Clearly, it is more important than ever that we confront the insidiousness that is Islamophobia. \u201cBut how? While Muslims pride themselves on being up to date on national politics, as well as being well versed in world events, when it comes to local politics Muslims are mostly absent. Many Muslims only vote in the presidential elections, if they vote at all. \u201cWe\u2019re all busy. We all have families and responsibilities that need our attention. But the time for sitting back and letting others take the lead and do the heavy lifting is over. We have to stop looking around for the perfect leader, and start standing up and being leaders. \u201cBecause knowing what is going on, and even being upset about it, is not enough. We must engage. We must reach out and help others who are struggling, even when we are struggling too. We must form real relationships where we each know we can depend on each other in times of need. \u201cThis means intersectionality. Supporting local causes outside of our Muslim communities. Propping up others being marginalized in today\u2019s America. Because while Muslims are the flavor of the month, we aren\u2019t the only flavor on the menu. \u201cWe need to start volunteering, running for city councils, for school boards, for state assemblies. United, we rise above the hate. It may seem like Islamophobia is everywhere, but the solution is local. That\u2019s where we need to focus.\u201d Abdul El-Sayed, Democratic candidate for Michigan governor and former health commissioner for Detroit El-Sayed wrote: \u201cI\u2019m a son of Michigan. My father and mother immigrated to Michigan from Egypt. I was raised by my father and my stepmother, Jackie, a native of Gratiot County, Michigan. This is where I was born and where I was raised. I love Michigan. But we\u2019ve fallen on hard times. Our politicians seem to have forgotten that government should be for people, by people. Instead, they\u2019ve bent over backward to accommodate corporate greed. \u201cGovernment has to provide a very basic set of goods and services to people who need them, and it has failed to so. Part of that is because corporate politicians like our current president are too busy dividing us rather than uniting us around our common goals. \u201cOur campaign is about coming together around the idea that the 10 million strong Michiganders can solve our shared challenges because of our shared future. We can unlock our economy, fix our failing public schools, break our dependence on oil, save our Great Lakes and provide everyone with quality healthcare. The vote for the current president was not a vote of inspiration. It was a vote of fear and cynicism. We have to believe in the unifying idea of us \u2013 the people. \u201cI saw the worst of this \u2018government by spreadsheet\u2019 when I was the health commissioner of Detroit. I was rebuilding a health department in Detroit after the city shuttered its 185-year old health department when it was facing state takeover. \u201cUnder the same governor, the state poisoned 9,000 kids in Flint. I realized that, in that moment, our state needed real leadership. I get it \u2013 I\u2019m relatively young, relatively brown, and yes, relatively Muslim. But I\u2019m also a physician in a state that has poisoned 9,000 kids, an educator in a state with a failing public school system, and a public servant in a state that is among the least transparent in the nation. And so I decided to stand up.\u201d Andr\u00e9 Carson, US Representative for Indiana\u2019s seventh congressional district Carson said: \u201cThere\u2019s a great drive for people to become more engaged politically, and we have a responsibility to maintain, preserve and improve our democracy. \u201cI serve with the directive and drive to be the best representative of the seventh congressional district of Indiana \u2013 putting Hoosiers first and thinking about Americans. As a Muslim, my role has been to inform, refute any perceptions or misconceptions about the religion, though I don\u2019t purport to be a scholar. But I still think it comes with responsibility to motivate and encourage other Muslims to participate in the political process. \u201cI think [Muslims] are concerned about Trump fanning the flames of Islamophobia, the anti-immigrant sentiment, and really encouraging the darker elements of our society to become more pronounced in their intolerance and their bigotry. I think that\u2019s disappointing, but I think there\u2019s a silver lining, and that silver lining suggests there\u2019s an increase in interest in American political life. There\u2019s a great drive for people to become more engaged politically, and we have a responsibility to maintain, preserve and improve our democracy. \u201cOne of the things that I do when I go across the country, I\u2019ll ask how many Muslims are in this particular city or how many Muslims are in the entire state? And even though the Muslim community is not a monolith, there is a mutual interest, even though there are different schools of thought. Usually when there\u2019s a sizable enough number \u2026 [I tell them] to focus on building a PAC or even supporting a non-Muslim candidate who is focused on standing up the rights of Muslims. \u201cThe reality is Muslims have been in this country since the inception of this country. We have just as much a right to it as any other citizen in the United States. Embrace the fact that this country is ours and let\u2019s engage in the political process. If you\u2019re interested in running for political office, don\u2019t just step out there, learn, do the research. Identify a campaign that shares your values, some part of it, go door to door, phone bank, help develop policy papers, find your niche and go for it.\u201d Sign up for Guardian US Today to receive the day\u2019s top US stories every morning"
"9||'I never realized how black everyone is': the uneasy truth about America's homelessAfrican American motorist Rodney King was beaten on the side of the road by four white Los Angeles police officers in March 1991. A year later, a verdict that cleared the officers of all but a single criminal charge triggered the Los Angeles riots, the biggest case of civil unrest in the city\u2019s history. King became a symbol of splintered race relations in the US. But there is an untold story, one in which his family exemplifies another painful phenomenon in American life. A few years before Rodney King\u2019s beating, his younger brother, Juan, had taken to alcohol and drugs. His addictions worsened when the glare of the media turned on the family. \u201cIt was a family crisis. And I got depressed,\u201d Juan said. He left his parents\u2019 home for good, landing on the streets of Santa Monica, Hollywood, Pasadena and Skid Row. \u201cI\u2019ve been homeless off and on for 25 years now,\u201d he said. Juan King fits a common profile of a homeless person in 2017: black, male and middle-aged. Minorities \u2013 namely African Americans and Latinos \u2013 have composed a disproportionate share of the nation\u2019s homeless population for decades. Yet the implications are rarely acknowledged explicitly. \u201cPeople who work with the homeless see this obvious disproportionality,\u201d said Karen Lincoln, an associate professor and expert in social work at the University of Southern California, \u201cbut it\u2019s not something discussed in policy solutions.\u201d The recently announced results of this year\u2019s homeless counts in cities such as San Francisco, Seattle and Portland confirm the trend: people of color are overrepresented. Some 40.4% of the national homeless population is black, according to the University of Maryland School of Public Health, although African Americans make up just 12.5% of the general population. \u201cLife right now is unpredictable for me,\u201d said King. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of people of color are suffering worse.\u201d Minorities were only a sliver of the homelessness population in the early 20th century. Even in the 50s and 60s, the typical homeless person was white, male and in his 50s, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless. A shift began in the 1970s and after, when homelessness started to emerge in its modern form, in the wake of major cuts to low income housing and mental healthcare resources that affected the poorest communities \u2013 often minorities \u2013 most severely. With the onset of the war on drugs, prison became a holding pen for drug users and those with psychiatric illnesses. The crack cocaine epidemic of the 80s, meanwhile, brought black and Latino communities around the country \u201cto rock bottom\u201d, said Deon Joseph, an LAPD senior lead officer who patrols Skid Row in Los Angeles. \u201cBeing African American and growing up in the 80s, I saw how this disproportionate problem of crack cocaine devastated communities of color,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cSome people could go get treatment in Malibu, but black and brown people ended up in prison, and we still see the effects today.\u201d Sky-high housing costs continue to disproportionately impact minority residents in major cities such as Los Angeles. They have lower rates of property ownership, face discrimination from landlords, and are still living with the legacy of racist practices like redlining, which segregated cities by denying loans to minorities in certain neighborhoods. A poverty trap is the result. Juan King, now 50, grew up in a working class family in Altadena, in southern California. His father, Ronald, and mother, Odessa, cleaned houses for a living before starting a hospital janitorial business. Ronald died in 1984, and the four King brothers took over as breadwinners for the family, working in construction. The partnership didn\u2019t last long \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s really hard to work with family,\u201d Juan said \u2013 and he drifted from his siblings. Rodney\u2019s beating was a final blow of sorts to the family group. Juan says he always had the option to live in his mother\u2019s home, but his drug addiction made him seek isolation. Instead he roamed sidewalks and shelters across the county. By 2010, Juan was living under a bridge on the banks of the Los Angeles River, with just a jacket and backpack as belongings. \u201cThe streets were my palace,\u201d Juan said, with some irony. It was clear to him that something wasn\u2019t, and isn\u2019t, right. Los Angeles county notched a record 58,000 homeless people in a count this year, but the impacts are far from evenly felt. Some 22,000 are African Americans, a 28% spike over last year. Even more dramatic was the 63% jump in homeless Hispanics and Latinos. The tally of white homeless people, however, decreased by 2%, and in absolute terms their numbers were also smaller than the other two groups. The disparities are obvious on Skid Row, where more than 5,000 people sleep on the streets or in shelters each night. Its sidewalks feature a patchwork of tents, tarps, boxes and carts, with black and brown faces peeking out from pockets of shade that provide a modicum of respite from the blazing summer heat. Humphrey Jones, a 58-year-old black man, has been homeless for the past three years, and on a recent afternoon sat on a quieter side street, carefully wiping down the shoes and other accessories he finds in the trash or on the street. Illness and poor financial choices forced him out in \u201cthe jungle\u201d, he said, but he also linked his situation to racial and economic inequality. \u201cRich folks can\u2019t keep getting richer unless some of us stay down,\u201d he said. He whipped off his dark baseball cap to rub his short, greying hair in frustration. Nearby, a friend who overheard reacted with surprise. \u201cI guess I never realized, I never thought about how black everyone out here is,\u201d said a slender black woman named Myra, 54. \u201cIt\u2019s almost so obvious we forget.\u201d While Los Angeles recently allocated huge sums of money to resolving homelessness \u2013 nearly $5bn over 10 years \u2013 the plans do not address problems unique to impoverished people of color, said LA City councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who chairs the city\u2019s homelessness committee. Funding for services based on race are not allowed under California law. \u201cMeanwhile, mass incarceration and other forces make it possible to discriminate against a person [based on race] for a long time,\u201d Harris-Dawson said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about a broken foster care system, which is disproportionately black in almost the same way as homelessness.\u201d The implication for advocates is that the resolution of homelessness involves tackling enduring racial inequality as well as a housing shortage. The King family knows the impact of these forces only too well. Rodney died in an accidental drowning while intoxicated in 2012, after years of drug use and arrests. \u201cHe was a slow kid, but good-hearted. Rodney felt like he didn\u2019t fit how the world wanted him to be,\u201d Juan said. \u201cHe was always trying to clean up his life, but crack and alcohol just lower your ability to stay on track.\u201d During long nights under the bridge, Juan struggled with regret, and the feeling that he had wasted decades of his life. Several years ago, Juan finally committed to a program that would help him get sober, employed and off the street. It was a decision that saved his life in two ways: the center hosting the program, Union Station Homeless Services, ensured the treatment of his prostate cancer, and also arranged for his current apartment, a tiny, subsidized space in South LA, which he moved into in 2015 and rents for $350 a month. It\u2019s a rare stretch of stability for Juan, yet homelessness continues to stalk the King family. King\u2019s older brother, Ronald Jr, suffers from a variety of mental illnesses that seemed to Juan to stem from a car crash in 1987. \u201cThe accident left him paranoid, not wanting to be inside a house,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s still out on the streets in LA as far as I know.\u201d Do you have an experience of homelessness to share with the Guardian?

"21||John Singer Sargent\u2019s The Lady With the Umbrella: an artist letting his hair downBeautiful people Sargent was the great flatterer of Edwardian high society, famed for his oil portraits of its belles and beaus. Although on familiar territory, this watercolour is clearly the work of an artist letting his hair down. Clothes make the woman It is a giant come-on of an image: the supine young woman, who seems to have been swept over by oceans of frothy white lace and satin, while her sexually suggestive, toppled parasol points to her crotch. Closely cropped, her body \u2013 an \u201cS\u201d shape that winds to a beautiful and unreadable face \u2013 is there to be imaginatively dived into. Oil and water The woman has been identified as Sargent\u2019s niece Rose-Marie Ormond. It\u2019s one of many thousands of watercolours he made while taking time out from his heavy roster of commissions in oil. Liquid days The watercolours show a more experimental side. Created outdoors with a focus on light, they seem rooted in modern Impressionist thinking. Subjects include people one would never associate with the painter, such as blind street musicians or soldiers on the front.

Or master-slave relationship? Or both? Persuasion (1817) by Jane Austen A trip to Lyme Regis is the novel\u2019s turning point, with Anne\u2019s response to Louisa\u2019s injury when she falls on the Cobb (authorial punishment for being a flirty, impulsive show-off) leading Wentworth to view the heroine afresh. The Cobb makes its second appearance in fiction 150 years later in John Fowles\u2019s The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman. \u201cThe Lady with a Lapdog\u201d (1899) by Anton Chekhov Romance blooms on the seafront at Yalta between a jaded Muscovite and another holidaymaker, both married, but does it have a future? Often acclaimed (eg by Nabokov) as one of the greatest stories ever written. Death in Venice (1912) by Thomas Mann Staying on the Lido, distinguished author Gustav von Aschenbach becomes the obsessive, besotted stalker of Tadzio, a pretty Polish teenager, observing the boy daily from his deckchair. Filmed three times (notably by Visconti in 1971) and turned into a Benjamin Britten opera, Mann\u2019s holiday novella is better known today than all his longer fiction. Within a Budding Grove (1919) by Marcel Proust Proust\u2019s Parisian narrator decamps in the second book of In Search of Lost Timeto Balbec in Normandy, where he is attracted to a group of \u201cjeunes filles en fleur\u201d on the sands led by the bewitching, elusive Albertine. Their on-off relationship is at the centre of all the sequence\u2019s remaining novels bar the last. Ulysses (1922) by James Joyce As befits a book named after Homer\u2019s sailor, the great Dublin novel begins by the sea in the Martello tower of Telemachus. In Nausicaa, 12 chapters later, dusk finds Leopold Bloom peering pervily at young Gerty MacDowell as she sits (aware of his gaze) with friends on rocks on Sandymount Strand. A strong claim to be fiction\u2019s first masturbation scene outside porn. Tender Is the Night (1934) by F Scott Fitzgerald The most full-on instance of classic beach fiction, as its main setting is the French Riviera, where a love triangle \u2013 psychiatrist Dick Diver, his Zelda-based wife Nicole, starlet Rosemary \u2013 plays out amid a set of American expats and tourists. Dick\u2019s decline is marked by how well he performs such seaside stunts as aquaplaning behind a speedboat and headstands on a diving board. \u201cFirst Love\u201d (1948) by Vladimir Nabokov Also a chapter of his autobiography Speak, Memory, this is a mini-memoir of a 1909 family holiday in Biarritz, where the future writer played with Colette (aged nine to his 10) by the sea. It forms the template for similar scenes throughout his work, with the objects of desire always young but the male figures (as in Lolita) sometimes older. Gravity\u2019s Rainbow (1973) by Thomas Pynchon A wartime C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur holiday for Lieutenant Tyrone Slothrop is actually a means for the creepy British scientists observing the American to make him fall on the beach for a sexy Dutch spy (a giant octopus supposedly menacing her is part of this bizarre honey-trap). John DugdaleThis French opening to part two, which nods to Proust, transforms Pynchon\u2019s second world war epic from a London novel to a European one - Slothrop escapes, and heads north towards Germany. The Sea, The Sea (1978) by Iris Murdoch Autocratic theatre director Charles Arrowby retires to write his memoirs in a seaside cottage on a rocky coast (Cornwall?), but the past becomes uncomfortably real when he runs into his first love from 40 years earlier in a nearby village. Twenty-seven years later, John Banville would use a not dissimilar setting and set-up in another Booker winner, The Sea."
"11||Simon Rattle: 'I would have been wary about taking the job had I known about Brexit'\u201cI don\u2019t think that musicians can change the world \u2026 \u201d Hang on \u2013 this is not what Simon Rattle is supposed to say. Of all today\u2019s British conductors, Rattle is the one you would bet on not only contemplating changing the world but actually doing it. The former wunderkind who put Birmingham on the classical music map, he is now the conquering hero returning to the UK after 15 years in charge of the Berlin Philharmonic, which many consider the greatest orchestra in the world. He continues - \u201cbut I do think that musicians can make the world momentarily a better place.\u201d Phew. We are backstage at the Barbican, the London Symphony Orchestra\u2019s home venue, and the more Rattle talks the more it seems clear that he sees \u201cmaking things better\u201d as not only a possibility but a responsibility. When he takes up the post of music director at the LSO next month \u2013 he will combine this with the Berlin job for a year before leaving the Philharmonic in summer 2018 \u2013 he will carry with him an enormous weight of expectation. Teachers dream that his influence might fix the funding crisis in music education. Managers hope this rare household-name conductor will be a shot of adrenaline for the box office. Audiences want to hear that velvety Berlin Phil tone added to the LSO\u2019s already dazzling palette, and the LSO players themselves know that he is likely to be listened to when he insists on good rehearsal time and conditions for his musicians. \u201cHe is a game-changer,\u201d says Nicholas Kenyon, managing director of the Barbican Centre and Rattle\u2019s biographer. \u201cHe gets music on to the front pages of newspapers; the television cameras follow him. He takes music to a new level.\u201d Rattle has been accused of being too much of a politician, of talking in soundbites, but it\u2019s more that the words come out in short, sweeping bursts of enthusiasm. He is a galvaniser, an inspirer, and he knows this is a necessary role for a musician in such a public position. After our interview, I watch him giving a two-minute pep talk to a conference of music teachers, and you can practically see them basking in the glow. There is an air of inevitability about Rattle coming back to the UK to helm its highest-profile orchestra, even if he won\u2019t admit it. He claims the idea of taking on the LSO hadn\u2019t occurred to him until he was in London to guest conduct Wynton Marsalis\u2019s Swing Symphony in July 2012, when an old friend in the orchestra happened to ask, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t just think of coming here and being the boss?\u201d His other performance with the LSO that summer was for the opening ceremony of the London Olympics \u2013 remember Mr Bean playing one-finger synth in \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d? You could argue that the Rattle-LSO brand was already being built up back then. He is looking forward to getting stuck in. \u201cOf course, the feeling of coming home is important,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was the orchestra\u2019s curiosity and enthusiasm and complete lack of bullshit that I found amazingly attractive. And their rhythmic precision and flexibility and energy are incredible. Because I\u2019ve been so steeped in this very particular Berlin tradition I know that I can also offer them a lot in terms of depth of sound. And there are other areas \u2013 they have played no baroque music in recent years, and very little Haydn and Mozart \u2013 where I can be of use.\u201d Rattle is being modest; and as for the LSO, which in the past decade has had eight years of fly-in-fly-out leadership from Valery Gergiev followed by a two-year interregnum, it is positively champing at the bit. The week we meet, Rattle is in town for two performances with his new orchestra, one of them a community opera with music by Andrew Norman, A Trip to the Moon, involving the massed community choirs of the LSO Discovery scheme. This is the third time in as many years that Rattle has commissioned a gigantic new work for amateurs and professionals together, to be performed in London, Berlin and elsewhere. In Berlin in 2015, the first of these \u2013 The Monster in the Maze, composed by Jonathan Dove \u2013 took on added resonance as a substantial number of those who signed up were refugees and that the story, based on the Minotaur myth, involved boatloads of young people taking a journey to unknown dangers. The Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s education department \u2013 something it didn\u2019t have until Rattle\u2019s arrival \u2013 has been very active in its work with the city\u2019s new arrivals, and so has its conductor. Last spring, Rattle and his orchestra joined Daniel Barenboim and Iv\u00e1n Fischer in a concert at the Philharmonie in Berlin for an audience of refugees and their helpers. \u201cWe thought it was necessary for someone to say \u2018Welcome\u2019. My assistant, who is running lots of education projects in the camp in Tempelhof, went with one of the refugees from Aleppo, a teacher, into the foyer. And this little boy ran up to them and threw his arms around the teacher \u2013 they were both from the same street in Aleppo. Neither of them knew the other was there \u2013 and they met in the foyer of the Phil. I had a little weep when I heard that.\u201d The Philharmonie is home to the Berlin Philharmonic in a way that the Barbican isn\u2019t to the LSO, not quite. Rattle is vocal about the disadvantages of the Barbican: \u201cEverybody does absolutely the best they can, but it\u2019s like running round very fast in a lift; there\u2019s a certain point where the walls and the ceiling are all too close.\u201d The story that he made a new London concert hall a condition of signing his contract with the LSO is not true, but what is remarkable is that it was believable: Why does he have so much clout? \u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d Oh, come on. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve been away,\u201d he jokes. But then he turns serious. \u201cWhen I was in Birmingham it was a very fortuitous time as politicians on both sides of the divide were wanting to make a new city.\u201d Rattle, aged 25, was appointed conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 1980, and within three years plans to build Symphony Hall were being drawn up. \u201cThe politicians were smart enough to realise that the city needed not only a new image but a new heart and soul. It was made very clear to me that the cultural centre would get built, even if they fought like cats and dogs over everything else.\u201d The proposed new Centre for Music on the site of the Museum of London got to the stage of a feasibility study before having its government funding withdrawn. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure how much of the emergence of the new concert hall as an idea was simply to do with the rivalry between George Osborne and Boris Johnson,\u201d Rattle says \u2013 but the fact that it is no longer the ball in a game of political whiff-whaff makes it if anything more likely to get built. \u201cNow it\u2019s up to us to raise an enormous amount of money. If there was ever a time when it might work, it could be now.\u201d Momentum does seem to be growing; a shortlist of possible architects was announced days after we spoke. But it\u2019s clear that Rattle believes the new building must be a centre for education as well as a concert hall. \u201cThis art form is for everybody. It is our job to spread the word, not just to play the music. I said to the orchestra in Berlin, \u2018You\u2019ve been fantastic high priests but you now have to be evangelists as well.\u2019\u201d If education projects are to engage new listeners, he says, they have to be \u201cthings that people can do rather than watch\u201d, and concert halls have to change \u201cin the way that most museums have changed \u2013 from don\u2019t touch to please touch\u201d. For the time being, though, Rattle will be doing what he can at the Barbican, and making plans for some big works as one-off events in bigger venues \u2013 2018 will see Stockhausen\u2019s immense, enveloping work Gruppen in the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern. And his Prom this month gives him and the LSO the chance to perform Schoenberg\u2019s colossal Gurrelieder in the Royal Albert Hall, free from the space restrictions of the Barbican. His title at the LSO will be Music Director \u2013 which in itself signals a change from the role taken by his immediate predecessors, who were designated Chief Conductor. What is the difference? \u201cI will be much more involved with the day to day, even though I won\u2019t be living here permanently. This is a proudly independent orchestra, but it\u2019s a matter of having someone taking care \u2013 it\u2019s been a long time since they\u2019ve had that.\u201d Not every conductor wants to take on the nitty gritty of an orchestra\u2019s long-term development. \u201cValery [Gergiev] wasn\u2019t interested, nor Claudio [Abbado]. Colin [Davis] loved them to bits, but he made it very clear that he did not want anything to do with the running or the auditions or the personnel.\u201d So when did the LSO last have a real caretaker? \u2018I suppose it was Andre\u201d, he says \u2013 and Previn ended his tenure as principal conductor in 1979. Rattle will be in London for about four months every year in total, when, he says, \u201cI will absolutely work my ass off for the orchestra and for the arts. And then it will be good to escape. I think if I lived here I would be \u2018on\u2019 absolutely every day, and I\u2019m not sure I would survive. Not in my 60s.\u201d Home for the 62-year-old will remain Berlin, where his children are growing up. He and his wife, the Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Ko\u017een\u00e1, have two boys aged 12 and nine, and a three-year-old girl. (He has two grown-up sons from his first marriage.) They live half an hour from the city centre, five minutes from the Grunewald, where a forest walk offers the chance of an encounter with a wild boar, and next to a lake where the children can swim. Family life involves \u201can awful lot of football and table tennis and trampoline. Or we go down to the local playground, or we make sushi together \u2013 it\u2019s really messy but not so difficult if you don\u2019t want it to look gorgeous. And there\u2019s a lot of making sure the tortoises don\u2019t escape from the garden. All they do is sleep, eat and try to escape. We had three.\u201d How many do they have now? He winces. \u201cTwo.\u201d When Rattle took the LSO job \u2013 his appointment was announced in March 2015 \u2013 he thought he would be travelling between two EU countries. The morning after the referendum he was in London, rehearsing with the LSO. \u201cPeople were desperately upset. Some of the players asked whether I\u2019d have taken the job if I had known. I said it would have made me extraordinarily wary, it\u2019s true \u2013 but we will make the best of it we can. And a lot of our European counterparts have said, \u2018We are going to try to do more work with you rather than less!\u2019\u201d With the orchestra, or with Rattle? \u201cConductors aren\u2019t separate people! We don\u2019t exist without our orchestras.\u201d You could argue that some of the great conductors have been very separate people indeed, but standing apart is not Rattle\u2019s style: one of his singular talents has been for making musicians and audiences feel that he and they are all in it together. Our interview done, he hops on to the podium to take an open rehearsal of Sibelius\u2019s Symphony No 2, ready for the weekend\u2019s concert. The stage is creaking with a huge orchestra, half seasoned LSO pros and half young Guildhall students. There are no grand pronouncements about how he wants the piece to go \u2013 instead, he just raises his baton: \u201cLet\u2019s make some music and see what happens.\u201d \u2022 Rattle and the LSO perform Schoenberg\u2019s Gurrelieder at the Proms on 19 August; the LSO\u2019s new season begins on 14 September with a 10-day festival to mark the arrival of their new music director. alwaysmoving.lso.co.uk."

"12||Beyonc\u00e9 conspiracies, Brian Cox\u2019s cosmos and body positivity - best podcasts of the weekPick of the week: The Nod New podcast The Nod (Gimlet/iTunes) is a banger right from the start. \u201cFor as long as we can remember, we have been obsessed with the stories and the people who define what it is to be black,\u201d says Brittany Luse. \u201cThat\u2019s Black with a capital B,\u201d adds co-host Eric Eddings. Formerly hosts of For Colored Nerds, Luse and Eddings are having a whole lot of fun with their new venture. Each episode gets straight down to business \u2013 and is over in about 30 minutes. Their observations range from astute to utterly hilarious, as they make good on their promise to dive into \u201cthe biggest moments and most under-explored corners of black culture\u201d. Lurking in one of these corners is YouTube sex empress Tyomi, a woman who grew up writing erotic fan fiction about boyband B2K and can tell you how to surfboard \u00e1 la Beyonc\u00e9 (apparently \u201cit\u2019s just cowgirl in a bathtub\u201d). Meanwhile, Eddings\u2019 detailed takedown of Shawn Blazington\u2019s YouTube conspiracy theory about Beyonc\u00e9 forcing Solange to give birth to Blue Ivy, complete with \u201cbomb-ass Powerpoint slideshow\u201d, is podcast gold. The latest episode, Good for the Blacks, brings in an audience and guests. Luse describes it as \u201cthe definition of lit, it was popping \u2026 the most fun that could possibly be had on a Wednesday night\u201d. Call Your Girlfriend\u2019s Aminatou Sow and The New Yorker\u2019s Vinson Cunningham are also there, to consider things that are both positive and negative for black culture. Jay-Z\u2019s 4:44 scrapes through as a good thing, despite his questionable theories on love and economics. But the jury\u2019s out on The Bachelor. \u201cThe experience of watching television as a person of colour is that you were always, like, on this high alert for how the person on the screen is going to embarrass you \u2026 White people don\u2019t watch TV like that,\u201d notes Sow. It\u2019s the sort of statement that will have people nodding along in recognition, and that\u2019s what this podcast is all about. Your picks: from the murky medicine cabinet to social media scrutiny Sawbones Would you drill a hole in your head to cure a headache? Treat excessive blood loss with more bleeding? There\u2019s a reason your healthcare doesn\u2019t cover exorcisms and your pharmacist no longer supplies bezoars. Co-hosts Justin and Dr Sydnee McElroy take a weekly dive into the often misguided history of medicine and the weird ways we\u2019ve tried to fix ourselves. Not for the faint-hearted. Recommended by John Mcmanus Appearance Matters I love Appearance Matters; it\u2019s the podcast that investigates everything related to the way we look, hosted by the Centre for Appearance Research in Bristol - a world leading research centre, so you know you\u2019re getting the very best. The podcast covers everything from big business, surgery and activism but my favourite episode is on social media and body image. The team talk to Dr Amy Slater and Megan Crabbe, who is a body positive blogger and instgrammer. Together the group delve into social media and discuss the psychology, anthropology and pressures it brings, to people of all ages, but particularly young women. It is brilliant hearing from such well informed and articulate women about how to deal with the implications of social media on your looks. Recommended by Hannah Jarman Examining Ethics Examining Ethics approaches a range of important issues, covering everything from net neutrality, the climate, protest, parenting (or whether it\u2019s ethical to be a parent at all) and animal mortality. My favourite episode is Distrusting the Narrative, which deconstructs the story of the first women\u2019s prison in America and reveals tales from this notorious institution. The guests on the show not only help tell those stories, but deconstruct the ethics and psychology behind both the people who were incarcerated and worked there. Like all of the episodes of this podcast, their analysis comes from a place of humility, rather than trying to preach. Recommended by Lauren Laskowski Guardian Pick: Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw answer your questions A peek behind the cosmic curtain The Science weekly team recently aired a live recording on the Guardian\u2019s Facebook page, putting listener\u2019s spacey questions to professor Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw. It was such a fantastic listen: from the very start the team went in hard - questioning the validity of the Big Bang, explaining how to take photos of the early universe and revealing that we\u2019re all bathed in microwaves. And that was just in response to the first question. I\u2019m not someone who\u2019s actively interested in the great unknowns of space but I couldn\u2019t draw myself away from the extraordinary answers that Cox and Forshaw gave. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve never thought to ask how our universe began or what on earth inflation is, but this is a fascinating podcast that anyone can listen to, as proven by the five year old who submitted their question right at the end.

"7||Transfer round-up: Roma raise bid for Leicester\u2019s Riyad Mahrez to \u00a331.5mRoma have submitted a new bid worth \u20ac35m (\u00a331.5m) for Leicester\u2019s Riyad Mahrez, with the Premier League side expected to reject the latest approach for the 2015-16 PFA player of the season. The Algerian has been the subject of several approaches by the Serie A side, who has been identified by the new coach, Eusebio Di Francesco, as his No1 transfer target. However, despite Mahrez\u2019s public declaration that he wants to leave the King Power Stadium this summer, Leicester remain determined not to allow him to leave for less than their valuation of around \u00a340m. Arsenal have also been linked with a move for the 26-year-old, with Craig Shakespeare admitting earlier this week that Mahrez would prefer to remain in the Premier League. \u201cHe wants to play for a top-six club. If we don\u2019t get an offer from a top-six club, he stays. If that offer comes in and it\u2019s not enough, he stays,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is quite clear for me at the moment, he has made that statement and he is our player.\u201d Josh Onomah has completed a season-long loan from Tottenham Hotspur to Aston Villa. The 20-year-old midfielder, who starred in England\u2019s triumphant Under-20 World Cup campaign earlier in the summer, has reached a stage where he needs to play regular first-team football. Mauricio Pochettino rates Onomah, who has trained with the Tottenham squad for the past three years but not done enough to guarantee the player would get the minutes he needs this season. Usually the manager prefers to keep his brightest young players with him, trusting himself and his coaches to bring them on and drill into them the way that he wants to play. Onomah, however, has reached a crossroads. After three years he knows what Pochettino wants from him and now he has to go and show it. Pochettino is aware that at Villa \u2013 one of the biggest clubs in the Championship \u2013 Onomah will be exposed to high levels of competition and pressure, while he will play alongside seasoned professionals. He has extended his contract at Tottenham until 2021. There has been a question mark over Onomah\u2019s best position. Pochettino has seen him as an attacking midfielder, who can play anywhere in the line of three behind the striker, but Onomah shone at the Under-20 World Cup in a box-to-box role, with a deeper starting position. Steve Bruce, the Villa manager, has moved for him after losing Jack Grealish for at least three months to a freak kidney injury. Pochettino is close to a permanent transfer for the Southampton reserve goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga, whom he worked with previously when he was the manager at St Mary\u2019s. The 25-year-old Argentinian spent last season on loan at Rayo Vallecano in the Spanish second division. The move follows Tottenham\u2019s failure to agree a permanent deal for Pau L\u00f3pez, who spent last season on loan at White Hart Lane from Espanyol. Meanwhile Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez has left Middlesbrough to join Sampdoria for a reported \u20ac11m. The Uruguay international joined Southampton in 2012 from Bologna and had spells on loan at Hull and Boro before moving to the Riverside on a permanent deal last summer."
"7||Liverpool face Hoffenheim and Celtic draw Astana in Champions League play-offsLiverpool will face Hoffenheim, the fourth-placed side in last season\u2019s Bundesliga, in their play-off match, while Celtic face a long trip to Kazakhstan to take on Astana in the final qualifiers before the group stage begins. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side will start as favourites against Hoffenheim, but will be tested by a side who survived relegation under Julian Nagelsmann before pulling off a surprise top-four finish. Celtic face an 8,000 mile round trip to take on Astana, who they defeated in the third qualifying round last season. Elsewhere, France and Italy\u2019s third-placed sides, Napoli and Nice, face each other. The winners of the ten ties will join 22 sides who have already qualified for the group stages. The first legs, with Hoffenheim and Celtic at home, are on 15 or 16 August, with the return legs the following week. Liverpool face Crystal Palace between the two ties, and Arsenal on 27 August. In the Europa League play-off draw, Everton have been drawn against Croatian side Hadjuk Split. Full draw Champions route: Qarabag v FC Copenhagen APOEL v Slavia Prague Olympiacos v Rijeka Celtic v Astana Hapoel Beer Sheva v Maribor League route: Istanbul Basaksehir v Sevilla Young Boys v CSKA Moscow Napoli v Nice Hoffenheim v Liverpool Sporting Lisbon v Steaua Bucharest Istanbul Basaksehir v Sevilla Young Boys v CSKA Moscow Napoli v Nice Hoffenheim v Liverpool Sporting Lisbon v Steaua Bucharest It\u2019s a return to Germany for J\u00fcrgen Klopp, and former Hoffenheim striker Roberto Firmino. Hoffenheim will play at home in the first leg, as England and Germany\u2019s fourth-placed teams are drawn against each other. Next, it\u2019s Napoli v Nice! So Hoffenheim or Steaua for Liverpool... The second tie out is Young Boys v CSKA Moscow... They\u2019re not hanging about here \u2013 first up, it\u2019s Istanbul Basaksehir v Sevilla! Brendan Rodgers\u2019 boys are next out, and will face Kazakh champions Astana, who they faced in last season\u2019s third round. The away leg will be second; that\u2019s not a great draw, all things considered. Here\u2019s the full Champions Route draw: Qarabag v FC Copenhagen APOEL v Slavia Prague Olympiacos v Rijeka Celtic v Astana Hapoel Beer Sheva v Maribor Olympiacos v Rijeka, which leaves Astana or Hapoel Beer Sheva for Celtic... Next, it\u2019s APOEL v Slavia Prague... That was quick. First up, it\u2019s Qarabag v FC Copenhagen... Next up, it\u2019s none other than Uefa\u2019s head of club competitions, Michael Heselschwerdt, with some technical information. The Champions route will be drawn first, and seeded teams aren\u2019t certain to play at home second, as far as I\u2019m aware \u2013 it depends which team is drawn first. I thought for one blissful moment that they were going to get straight on with the draw. But no, we\u2019re getting a montage of last season\u2019s final between Juventus and Real Madrid first. Another chance to enjoy that Mario Mandzukic goal, at least. Woof! Here we go! Giorgio Marchetti struts out to muted applause. \u201cWelcome to the home of football\u201d he chirps, then tells us that the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, can\u2019t be here today. The draw should be coming up aaaaany minute now. I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t drag it out. These guys are professionals! Liverpool fan Neal Lynch knows what he wants. \u201cAnyone but Hoffenheim please. Nice would not be especially nice either... let\u2019s have some eastern European action.\u201d Hoffenheim, whose manager Julian Nagelsmann turned 30 last month, do look the most dangerous side of the five. If it\u2019s Eastern Europe you\u2019re after, Steaua Bucharest, who lost 6-0 on aggregate to Manchester City last season, look a safer bet than Basaksehir, who nearly \u2018did a Leicester\u2019 in Turkey last season and now come with added Emmanuel Adebayor. There are some familiar names lying in wait for Celtic \u2013 they played both Astana and Hapoel Beer Sheva on their way to the group stages last year, with a 5-4 aggregate win over the Israeli champions proving particularly taxing. Celtic also took on Qarabag, champions of Azerbaijan, two years ago \u2013 they rarely qualify the easy way. Champions route Seeded teams: Olympiacos (Greece), Celtic (Scotland), FC Copenhagen (Denmark), APOEL (Cyprus), Maribor (Slovenia). Unseeded teams: Qarabag (Azerbaijan), Astana (Kazakhstan), Rijeka (Croatia), Hapoel Beer Sheva (Israel), Slavia Prague (Czechia). League route Seeded teams: Sevilla (Spain), Napoli (Italy), Liverpool (England), CSKA Moscow (Russia), Sporting (Portugal). Unseeded teams: Steaua Bucharest (Romania), Young Boys (Switzerland), Hoffenheim (Germany), Nice (France), Istanbul Basaksehir (Turkey). Scottish champions Celtic have already played four qualifying ties to reach this final hurdle, while Liverpool are the only one of five English qualifiers not to go straight into the group stages. The Champions League is not a bastion of equality, but both sides are on similar footing at this stage. There are two routes forward, named Champions and League (see what they did there) \u2013 Celtic are seeded in the former, and Liverpool in the latter. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019ll be straightforward for either. Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side are guaranteed a long trip, with a city break to face Slavia Prague or Rijeka on the Croatian coast perhaps more appealing than Qarabag, Astana or Hapoel Beer Sheva. For Liverpool, there is plenty of danger lurking in the draw. Mario Balotelli\u2019s Nice defeated Ajax to join Young Boys, Steaua Bucharest and two other dark horses, Hoffenheim and Istanbul Basaksehir, in the hat. The draw begins at approximately 11am BST, 12pm local time."
"1||Inside the doping hotspot of Ethiopia: dodgy testing and EPO over the counterInside Ethiopia\u2019s flagship stadium, the bleachers are painted the green, yellow and red of the flag. The country\u2019s best athletes have converged in Addis Ababa for the national championships while the great and good of Ethiopian sport gather trackside in matching beige suits and white baseball caps. Haile Gebrselassie is among them, handing out medals in his capacity as the president of the Ethiopian Athletics Federation. He receives a louder cheer than anyone when introduced by the stadium announcer. Two Olympic and four world 10,000m titles mark him out as one of the greatest distance runners of all time and the most famous man in Ethiopia, where athletics is the national sport. His reputation has helped build an enviable property and business portfolio, making him a wealthy man. At one end of the stadium a billboard pictures other distance running greats Kenenisa Bekele, Tirunesh Dibaba and Almaz Ayana, whose extraordinary 10,000m world record at the Rio Olympics last summer was greeted with disbelief in some quarters. Beneath them, in bold writing, is the statement: \u201cIt is possible to be the best without doping.\u201d However a joint investigation by the Guardian, the German broadcaster ARD and Holland Media Combination suggests that may not be true in every case. It shows how easy it is to obtain doping products in the country and there emerges a prevailing sense of disorganisation at the Ethiopian anti-doping agency, which is charged with testing athletes. A hugely successful Ethiopian athlete is also caught on undercover film, seeking a new doping programme and admitting to having taken performance-enhancing drugs before claiming one of her biggest titles. The findings may raise concern for British Athletics, which holds annual high-altitude training camps in Ethiopia for top athletes, including Mo Farah, who is attempting to do the distance double for a third time at the world championships in London, which begin on Friday. Outside the national stadium, two girls sell cobs of corn and coffee beans from colourful mats on the ground. But during the week of the Ethiopian championships, the blood-boosting drug EPO could be bought freely from a pharmacy just over the road. It is a popular drug, particularly among athletes and cyclists looking to gain an illegal edge by enhancing their endurance levels. A sign for the Gishen pharmacy is broken at one edge but potted plants decorate the doorway and it is clean inside. First, a reporter from the Guardian asks for something to treat anaemia, suggesting EPO as a possible medicine. A female pharmacist disappears into a back room briefly and delves into a fridge, returning with a cardboard box filled with dozens of phials of EPO stacked one on top of the other. She asks nonchalantly how many are required and three were bought for 810 Ethiopian birr (around \u00a326) in cash. The same reporter returned a second time only 13 minutes later, buying a further two phials of EPO, a toothbrush and a tube of mosquito repellent from a different pharmacist. A different reporter then entered the pharmacy and bought four phials of EPO from a third person. A male pharmacist admitted he knew of the performance-enhancing benefits of EPO and had sold it to athletes. \u201cSometimes, yes,\u201d he giggled. In the space of 26 minutes, nine phials of EPO were purchased at a cost of 2,430 birr (\u00a379). A sticker on the reverse of the glass container states they should be dispensed on the prescription of a physician only. But no questions were asked. No prescriptions were sought. The director general of the Ethiopian anti-doping agency, Mekonnen Yidersal, promised to investigate. He said: \u201cIf somebody is involved with this illegal practice, he or she will be punishable as per the World Anti-Doping Code and other relevant anti-doping laws of Ethiopia.\u201d The fact EPO is so easily purchased close to the national stadium is a strong contradiction of the suggestion Ethiopia is getting tough on drugs cheats. The country has introduced deterrents of prison sentences of between three to five years for anyone found to be doping. Only this year, Gebrselassie was proudly announcing the first prison sentence had been issued, with Girmay Birahun, a little-known 22-year-old marathon runner, sent to jail for doping. The IAAF, athletics\u2019 world governing body, has been working with the country\u2019s anti-doping agency and suggestions behind the scenes are that it has been impressed by a commitment to anti-doping education, with one official saying it outstripped many western nations. But when asked to provide testing figures from the national championships, a very confused picture emerged. The championships took place from 16 to 21 May but the first set of figures supplied were for 21 to 26 May and suggested 111 in-competition urine tests were conducted and 15 pre-event blood passport tests. However a total at the bottom suggested 18 blood tests and 83 urine tests had been carried out. When the figures arrived for the correct dates, they had been altered. The anti-doping room is in the bowels of the stadium, signposted by an A4 sheet of paper taped to the door but it remained locked for several hours during one day of the championships when 16 tests were said to have been conducted. In a statement, the Ethiopian anti-doping agency said: \u201cRegarding to the testing figures conducted on the 46th Ethiopian Athletics Championship, there was a mistake occurred on the table when we wrote in the tab. \u201cThe final day was Saturday and Sunday. Therefore some of our staff, including me, were in the stadium to facilitate the outreaching programme and sample collection process. On the other hand, since the day was the weekend, some of our staff were out of office.\u201d For years, it has been Ethiopia\u2019s east African neighbour Kenya in the spotlight for doping offences. Last year another documentary by ARD contained allegations that doping was rife at a high-altitude training camp in Iten including a doctor filmed on a hidden camera claiming he had supplied \u201cmore than 50\u201d athletes, including three British runners, with doping products. Even before that documentary, there was a shift by British athletes \u2013 including Farah \u2013 from Kenya to Ethiopia. They mostly train in Sululta, a village 2,500m above sea level and about 10 miles north of the capital up a treacherous, windy road, wide enough for only one vehicle in parts. If you reach Sululta early enough in the morning there is a vista over sprawling Addis Ababa before the smog sets in, enveloping a city of four million people. The attractions for athletes, aside from the altitude, are miles of dirt trails and solitude in a place where entertainment options are limited to a cup of coffee at a roadside cafe. There is one athletics track, with a man selling bamboo from a wheelbarrow at the entrance. On the track the Djiboutian athlete Ayanleh Souleiman, a former world indoor champion over 1,000m, jogs with a training partner. He and Ethiopia\u2019s highest-profile athlete, the 1500m world record holder Genzebe Dibaba, regularly train in Sululta and until last year were coached by Jama Aden. The Somalia-born Aden was also used by British Athletics as an \u201cunofficial facilitator\u201d for Farah at a training camp in Ethiopia in 2015. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the Briton, who has never failed a drugs test. Aden was arrested last year after EPO and other medicine was found in his hotel room in Spain, where he was at a training camp with athletes including Dibaba, a favourite for gold in London. There is a warrant for Aden\u2019s arrest in Ethiopia but the Guardian understands he returned to Addis Ababa for 48 hours earlier this year before fleeing. He was also spotted at the Doha Diamond League in Qatar, where he used to be a national team coach. Following Aden\u2019s arrest Dibaba said their relationship was based only around training and that she was \u201cneat and crystal clean\u201d. Last month Spanish prosecutors said Aden had been indicted on public health charges. The Guardian understands that the Spanish police also have a lot of evidence from mobile phones and laptops seized in the raid last year, including text messages and emails that suggest drug trafficking as well as administering banned substances to athletes. The IAAF anti-doping department is understood to be confident this additional evidence will be enough to pursue rule violation charges once the criminal case is concluded. Back in Addis Ababa there is more evidence Ethiopia\u2019s phenomenal track and field success is not purely down to the popularity of the sport and a genetic edge African-born runners possess. A high-profile female athlete is caught on a hidden camera asking another athlete about sourcing a new \u201cdoping programme\u201d. She talks casually about her running schedule, admitting to having taken Eprex, a brand name for EPO, before one of her biggest victories, in Europe several years ago. After much discussion she settles on a 45-day programme, taking EPO and human growth hormone on alternating days. It is agreed she will tell the fictitious doctor who has devised the programme about her progress and she will stop taking both substances a week before she is due to compete in order to evade the testers. Many Ethiopian coaches blame the prevalence of doping in the country on increasing numbers of foreign coaches and agents, particularly from eastern Europe. Yirefu Birhanu, an Ethiopian Olympic team coach who led Feyisa Lilesa to silver in the marathon in Rio, believes the relative poverty in Ethiopia and lack of education can mean athletes are tricked into taking drugs. \u201cI had two athletes test positive,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I asked them they said they were told it was not a banned substance, that it was vitamins and many famous athletes are using this. But the athletes have already killed their life because it was a banned substance. \u201cThere are a lot of managers,\u201d he adds. \u201cSome are doing their business from their heart. Some are doing it for money only, they care when the athletes are participating in races, after that they throw them away. \u201cI am advising to those managers, they must show all the information to their athletes. Because they are human beings, they are not a cow or something like this, they have their own right to know what they are doing.\u201d Another athlete who has trained in Ethiopia since 2003 has noticed the availability of drugs increase with an influx of coaches from eastern Europe. \u201cI believe it is foreign coaches bringing doping into Ethiopia. I think a lot of people have moved from Kenya, because it is more in the spotlight, to Ethiopia, because they are less likely to get caught. But I think it is more of an individual issue than a state-run thing. Ethiopian runners, most of them, don\u2019t have money to buy their own doping products so I think it is agents and managers getting them.\u201d British Athletics declined to comment but said it was satisfied all athletes on training camps in the country were subject to rigorous anti-doping procedures. The UK Anti-Doping chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, said: \u201cUnder the World Anti-Doping Code, UK Anti-Doping has the jurisdiction to test any athlete from the UK, anywhere in the world. We do test athletes internationally, including Ethiopia and from April 2016 to March 2017, we conducted 558 tests across 17 different sports in 22 countries. \u201cSadly, it is not uncommon for substances such as EPO to be available to purchase in a number of countries, and we are concerned about the increase in the number of people buying such substances over the internet. We would appeal to anyone with information about these substances being bought or used to contact us in confidence via reportdoping.com.\u201d"
"0||In a Heartbeat: the story behind the animated gay love short that's gone viralIt\u2019s not every day that a wordless, four-minute animated short about two young boys falling in love goes viral. But on Monday, when recent college graduates Esteban Bravo and Beth David posted their senior thesis film on YouTube, that\u2019s exactly what happened. The short, called In a Heartbeat, is a simple yet enduring story, a heartwarming fable of young love and all the irrepressible butterflies that come with it. It also just happens to be about two boys, which despite the ascent of LGBT characters in film and television is still rarefied in animated or children\u2019s cinema. Although Pixar hasn\u2019t yet shown a gay character in a feature film, there\u2019s evidence of progress \u2013 albeit very slow progress \u2013 in this year\u2019s Beauty and the Beast reboot. The film has what director Bill Condon hyped up as a \u201cnice, exclusively gay moment\u201d: Josh Gad\u2019s character, LeFou, shares a few-second dance with another man \u2013 which, for the optimist anticipating great strides from Disney, was a pretty insufficient form of progress. In a Heartbeat, though, unmoored from the prudence of Hollywood studios, is far more explicit. In just about as long as it takes to microwave a cup of ramen noodles, Bravo and David\u2019s film tells the sweet, intimate story of a boy named Sherwin, who has a crush on his classmate, Jonathan. His heart is, literally, jumping out of his chest when the object of his affection walks by, spinning an apple on his fingertips like a basketball, so Sherwin dashes behind a tree to try to contain it. Of course, Sherwin\u2019s reluctance is about so much more than being nervous to profess young love; he\u2019s also, as the film\u2019s description says it, \u201cat risk of being outed by his own heart\u201d. When Bravo and David, both computer animation majors at Ringling College of Art and Design in Florida, started work on the film in January 2016, it wasn\u2019t a gay romance. \u201cA friend of ours was pitching ideas to us for potential projects,\u201d David, 21, told me over the phone. \u201cIt was her idea to show a person with their heart popping out of their chest, chasing down a crush. But initially it was about a boy and a girl. It wasn\u2019t until Esteban and I decided to switch it to a same-sex crush that the film started to feel like a personal story that we were invested in. It was the kind of story we wish we had seen as kids.\u201d Bravo, who\u2019s 24 and now an animation intern at Blue Sky Studios (the company behind the Ice Age franchise), added: \u201cIt still makes sense when it\u2019s a boy and a girl because that doesn\u2019t mean someone wouldn\u2019t be afraid to disclose their feelings. But when it\u2019s put in the context of LGBT characters, there were so many more layers to explore, and we could infuse the story with our own backgrounds.\u201d The two announced a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for the project last November, more than quadrupling their initial goal of $3,000 by raising over $14,000. Now, just 72 hours after In a Heartbeat was released, it\u2019s already amassed over 12m views on YouTube. The two young film-makers, who grew up on the animated movies of Brad Bird, along with other turn-of-the-century classics like Finding Nemo, A Bug\u2019s Life and Cat\u2019s Don\u2019t Dance, have been overwhelmed by the rapturous reception. \u201cIt\u2019s been insane!\u201d Bravo said. \u201cFor two people making our first film, Beth and I are really excited that people have so deeply responded to it emotionally.\u201d The pair have been equally taken aback by the messages, both curious and congratulatory, they\u2019ve had to field. \u201cWe\u2019ve been answering emails and messages and phone calls both from people we\u2019ve never met and also our friends and family,\u201d said David, somewhat dumbfounded that an independently made short, conceived of at the small Sarasota college where they cut their film-making teeth, has found such an audience. \u201cAnd big-name people are contacting us! That\u2019s so crazy.\u201d As for why the internet has lifted In a Heartbeat to viral status, the two surmise it has something to do with the dearth of same-sex love stories in animated films. \u201cFrom a business standpoint, it makes sense why studios are afraid to portray LGBT characters, just because there\u2019s still part of the population that\u2019s not accepting,\u201d Bravo said. \u201cBut as leaders of children\u2019s content, it\u2019s really important for them to represent these people because not showing LGBT characters leads to a lot of internalized confusion as kids grow up.\u201d \u201cWe do want our films to be universal, but we know that because it\u2019s animation it\u2019s assumed that it\u2019s for children. And we want that to be OK,\u201d David said. While developing the film in their senior year, Bravo and David had the luxury of total creative autonomy, from the characters\u2019 furrowed brows to the lovely score, by Spanish composer Arturo Cardel\u00fas, that accompanies the film. They had a vague idea, when anticipation for the short grew after they released a teaser, that it might attract a considerable following on the web; but they weren\u2019t expecting this much viewership, and they certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined that, just three days after it was uploaded to YouTube, there\u2019d be Heartbeat fan-fiction and memorabilia with their characters\u2019 faces on it. \u201cThere was a part of us that was aware this could potentially be a baby-step towards normalizing LGBT romance and, hopefully, toward larger productions and studios doing something like this,\u201d David, who currently works at LA-based digital entertainment studio JibJab, said. \u201cI do think this kind of entertainment is wanted on a pretty broad scale.\u201d The two have entertained the idea of expanding In a Heartbeat into a series of shorts or a longer feature. But right now, they\u2019re simply enjoying what a meteoric success the passion project has become. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people reach out and ask in vague ways if they could talk to us about our futures,\u201d David said. \u201cBut as of now, we don\u2019t know what any of it means.\u201d"
"11||The Proms and Greek: this week\u2019s best UK classical concerts1 Prom 29: Khovanshchina The second of this year\u2019s Proms operas-in-concert is the less well-known of Mussorgsky\u2019s pair of stage masterpieces. One may need a primer in Russian history to understand the plot of his \u201cnational music drama\u201d Khovanshchina fully, but it\u2019s a score full of glorious, soaring melodic invention. Ante Jerkunica and Christopher Ventris head the cast. Royal Albert Hall, SW7, 6 August 2 Greek From a musical point of view, this year\u2019s Edinburgh international festival is a lacklustre affair, short on anything genuinely innovative. There is no substantial new music at all, just a new production of Mark-Anthony Turnage\u2019s first opera, based upon Steven Berkoff\u2019s East End retelling of the Oedipus legend, which received its UK premiere at the festival 29 years ago. Directed by Joe Hill-Gibbins and conducted by Stuart Stratford, with Alex Otterburn as Eddy, the staging is a joint undertaking between Scottish Opera and the new company Opera Ventures. Edinburgh Festival theatre, 5-6 August 3 Prom 32: Brian Elias\u2019s Cello Concerto New concertos seem to be featuring prominently at the Albert Hall this summer. After Pascal Dusapin\u2019s Outscape, his work for cello and orchestra, and Julian Anderson\u2019s work for piano, The Imaginary Museum, this week sees the first performance of Brian Elias\u2019s BBC commission, which he calls simply a cello concerto, promising a \u201cdream-like music narrative\u201d. The premiere, with Natalie Clein as the soloist, is the centrepiece of an all-British programme conducted by Ryan Wigglesworth that begins with Britten and ends with Elgar.

"28||George Harvie obituaryMy father, George Harvie, who has died aged 99, was an unorthodox teacher whose imagination touched pupils in three areas of Scotland: the once industrial \u201csteelopolis\u201d of Motherwell, the rural Tweed valley, and the housing schemes of west Edinburgh. The son of Christina (nee Notman), a milliner, and George Harvie, the office manager in Scotland\u2019s largest steelworks, George was born in Motherwell. He was bright but not sole-mindedly academic: rugby, singing, working on the Clyde steamers and courting Isobel Russell, a language teacher, whom he married in 1942, got in the way of a good degree from Glasgow University. In common with contemporaries, between 1939 and 1945 he was trained and ready in the Highland Light Infantry and RAF for action that never came. At the same time he lost friends such as his cousin Tom Notman, a pacifist medic who won a posthumous MC for evacuating the wounded from Monte Cassino in Italy. George trained as a teacher at Jordanhill Educational College in 1945-46 before taking a job at New Stevenston school in Motherwell, the first of a series of teaching posts. He inspired co-operation among others while never taking himself too seriously, whether helping create a sports centre to honour the war dead of Dalziel school, Motherwell, turning St Boswells primary school, into a local education hub, or pioneering mature student programmes at what would grow into Edinburgh Napier University. He was a pillar of the Border Liberals around David Steel. He sang in choirs into his 90s, and when confined to bed by a broken hip was plugged into Radio 3 while surveying the Gala hills. Isobel died in 2014; George is survived by their three children \u2013 Jane, Steve and me."
"17||Jenny Colgan: seriously, why do we still use cash?Cash needs reforming. But this isn\u2019t about how much money different people have through no fault of their own, and how rubbish that is. Obviously if anyone had even the vaguest answer to that we wouldn\u2019t currently be: a) fighting for our glorious liberated Brexit uplands; b) recycling our post-Brexit string by candlelight (delete as to personal preference). No, the problem is simply how outdated it is as a physical system. I can just about appreciate the aesthetic value of a 20 pence piece, but seriously, what\u2019s it for? It can\u2019t buy anything, and there are four even smaller coins to come after that, including the frankly horrifying five pence piece, which for some reason was designed to be too small to be picked up by human fingers larger than a six-year-old\u2019s. Five pences simply stare at you balefully, challenging you to see how spoiled you are by whether you can go through the guddle of fishing them out of your wallet or simply letting them accumulate in stupid piles around the house, dreaming one day of a vending machine that actually takes them. Parking is now so incredibly rare and expensive everywhere \u2013 but machines don\u2019t take notes, which means if you want to carry around the two kilos of change necessary to, for example, park for 90 minutes in Edinburgh town centre, you will, I suppose, at least get an arm workout from hauling bags of the grubby stuff about. Then there are notes. The mystical plastic fiver appears to have vanished from circulation. And if you\u2019re lucky enough to lay your hands on a 50, good luck spending it without somebody tutting, rolling their eyes and refusing it, thus making everybody\u2019s day that little bit less pleasant. That even includes your local bank, by the way, which, if it hasn\u2019t closed down, won\u2019t change money for you any more without charging you for the privilege. Of course, every single note you ever possess would test positive for being up the nose of some tosspot in the city with cocaine on it. It\u2019s literally filthy lucre. Plus some money has already voted for Scottish independence, apparently, so good luck spending a Scottish tenner in King\u2019s Cross. Also, it would have been nice to have saved women from all the rape and death threats they got for suggesting a picture of a woman should go on a \u00a310 note. You can\u2019t even give it away: try giving cash to charity collectors on the street. Actually, they\u2019d much rather you told them every single personal detail about yourself, sign up, invisibly commit to giving them money every single month until you die via direct debit by forgetting about it, while simultaneously being harassed by daily cold callers and having all your personal details sold to every mailing list in the history of the world, would that be OK? More than 50,000 people in Sweden now live more than 20km from their nearest cashpoint. They\u2019re aiming for a cashless society to cut down on the black market economy and money laundering, which makes perfect sense. The problem with that is that in Sweden they have a relatively equable society and a functioning welfare safety net. I worry that food bank Britain couldn\u2019t do without its black economy; that things could get even worse. But still: using cash in society works extremely well for depriving our tax take and funding all sorts of stuff you probably really don\u2019t want funded. Britain banned the \u20ac500 note long ago, after finding out that the only people who used \u20ac500 notes were really bad people. But my concerns are far more parochial: I am sick of worrying about losing my wallet, or fishing endlessly for it in my bag when I\u2019m already struggling to pack and carry a supermarket shop that comes to more than 30 quid; I want to stop feeling bad about how many trees get cut down to make a trillion pointless paper receipts when it could all simply appear on your phone with a touch of the finger. It wouldn\u2019t even change things that much. Admit it: your smartphone is already an extension of your mind, brain and soul. It carries your life the way the Doctor Who Ood carry their brains in their hands, so it might as well be your wallet too. Giving over the last physical reminders of currency, including those stupid gigantic two pences, wouldn\u2019t change the fact that if you have any money at all, the banking system controls most of it already and when Skynet (the AI system from the Terminator films) happens, that local bumwad money that\u2019s messing up the drawers in your house isn\u2019t going to alter the dystopia that much. In a ludicrously overcomplicated world, can\u2019t we aim to simplify it? Just once? Jenny Colgan\u2019s The Summer Seaside Kitchen is published by Little, Brown."
"1||Talking Horses: best bets for Friday\u2019s card at Glorious GoodwoodThe Group One action at this year\u2019s Glorious Goodwood is now in the form book, and while there were five winning favourites on Thursday\u2019s card, including Winter in the Nassau Stakes, there is still a good deal of punters\u2019 money in the bookies\u2019 satchels after two very difficult opening days. Valuable and competitive handicaps are the centrepiece of the final cards on Friday and Saturday, offering a chance to recoup at least some of the losses, and the likelihood that most backers will end up digging a deeper hole. Friday\u2019s Betfred Mile, though, does give the punters a chance because the draw, as so often, is likely to be crucial. It takes a Group-class horse to defy a wide stall in this race, or an overly strong pace that stretches the field and creates a little more running room. As it turns out, there was a Group One winner drawn in stall 16 but Here Comes When, who sloshed through the mud to win Wednesday\u2019s Sussex Stakes, is an inevitable non-runner on Friday, while the soft ground should keep the pace sensible. GM Hopkins, in stall one, is a hold-up horse who shows his best form on straight tracks, while Birchwood, in two, has not shown much this year. Master The World ran well in this race last year but from a similar draw, and is 3lb higher now. Zhui Feng, the Hunt Cup winner, seems best on fast ground, which leaves Tony Curtis (3.00) as the first horse out from the rail with an obvious chance and form with cut in the ground. Richard Hannon\u2019s gelding finished an excellent fourth in the Bunbury Cup last time up but ran as if a return to this trip will suit and could still have some room for improvement after a dozen starts over the past three seasons. Battaash (3.35) has made rapid strides in two races this season to be one of the highest-rated three-year-old sprinters around, and should continue his progress in the Group Two King George Stakes. Quayside (4.10) stumbled in the early stages of his last start and beat only one opponent home but his earlier win in a good time at Hamilton gives him every chance in the nursery, while Walton Street (5.15) was value for much more than his winning margin on his belated racecourse debut last month and his opening mark of 84 looks lenient.

"13||Apologia review \u2013 Stockard Channing induces sympathy for a monstrous matriarchStockard Channing, star of The West Wing and countless Broadway plays, takes the lead role in this revival of Alexi Kaye Campbell\u2019s play, first seen at London\u2019s Bush in 2009. Channing is a serious, intelligent actor and even induces sympathy for the character of a seemingly monstrous matriarch. Yet her presence involves some necessary rewrites and can\u2019t entirely resolve the contradictions in Campbell\u2019s play. Channing plays Kristin, a 60s political activist and celebrated art historian, who welcomes \u2013 if that is quite the word \u2013 her family to a birthday reunion. Originally British, Kristin is now American (\u201cby birth and not by choice\u201d) which means we lose several local references, including her past membership of the Workers Revolutionary party. But she remains a rampant idealist still scornful of those who don\u2019t share her views. She is especially brutal to her sons\u2019 girlfriends, one of whom is a devout Christian, the other a wealthy soap star. Yet you are made to feel Kristin has suffered emotionally for the loss of custody of her two children, Peter and Simon, at an early age. Political and family drama merge in a play that offers a passionate defence of the crusading fervour of the 60s. Much as I welcome that, I question Campbell\u2019s assumption that leftwing militancy is incompatible with good manners. For a self-styled humanist, Kristin behaves with such astonishing insensitivity to her sons\u2019 lovers that you wonder why they stay in the house as long as they do. Even if the intention is to show that Kristin has paid a heavy price for her lifelong political and professional obsessions, I still don\u2019t believe that a devotion to great causes induces a caustic brutality. Without softening the character, Channing skilfully suggests Kristin is a damaged spirit. She greets Trudi, the gushing American girlfriend of her eldest son, Peter, with a smiling patronage rather than downright contempt. Before she turns violently on the other girlfriend, Claire, she is keen to praise her work in what sounds like a dreadful fringe production of A Doll\u2019s House. But Channing is at her best in the second half when, in an echo of Chekhov\u2019s The Seagull, she dresses the wounds of her younger son, Simon. As she listens to Simon\u2019s pained account of how, through her negligence, he was picked up by a man in Genoa, Channing lets you see Kristin\u2019s belated recognition of her parental failings. By the end she has made you understand, if not like, the character. Jamie Lloyd\u2019s production is strongly cast all round. Joseph Millson doubles very effectively as both of Kristin\u2019s sons, the angry Peter and the sad Simon. Laura Carmichael is excellent as Trudi, catching both the character\u2019s naive good nature and the rising inflexions of a native American. Freema Agyeman is admirably spirited as the unrepentant soap star and Desmond Barrit, as a gay dinner guest, movingly suggests that behind the protests and the demos of the 60s lay a concern for people. I am sure that is true. But, although it is a good play, I still find Campbell\u2019s equation of extreme radicalism and rudeness hard to swallow. \u2022At Trafalgar Studios, London, until 18 November.

"6||London\u2019s exodus offers a stark warning to other UK cities: your culture is at riskFor the first time in half a decade, more people are leaving London than are moving to it. Net migration away from the capital has exceeded 80,000 people a year. So why are people leaving the city? And does it really matter? A lack of affordable, spacious and good-quality housing has of course been a push factor in the exodus from the city. So for some leavers, it\u2019s the allure of the \u201cbargain\u201d family house in the provinces. Others are being forcibly expelled, moved and dumped by their councils to cheaper accommodation in less affluent parts of the country. For others still, more realistic housing costs offer breathing space from the relentless hustle that is making rent in the capital. But it\u2019s not just housing. London has also become increasingly culturally sterile. Scores of LGBT venues have disappeared. Noise complaints and Operation Condor have sounded the death knell for other music hotspots, with 400 venues closing their doors in the capital in the last decade. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) has emerged to directly defend the night-time economy from the ravages of regeneration and \u201cluxury\u201d flat developments. The infamous King\u2019s Cross nightclubs \u2013 Bagley\u2019s, the Cross and the Key \u2013 have been replaced by Granary Square, a privately owned public space owned by UK and Australian asset management firms and pension funds. Here, you can \u201ceat, drink, shop\u201d, unless \u2013 of course \u2013 you are refused right of entry. Or you want to take a photo. All of this points to a process that sociologist Saskia Sassen calls \u201cdeurbanisation\u201d. Numerically, this means haemorrhaging residents, while metaphorically it relates to the increasing hollowing out of the social and cultural vibrancy of the city. The very things that make up its fabric \u2013 the messiness, unpredictability and diversity of urban life \u2013 are stripped away. All that\u2019s left is Costa Coffee, Pret-a-Manger and hoardings advertising buy-to-let investments, illustrated by white couples laughing and sipping champagne. If this migration away from London is a canary in the coalmine for the vitality of the city, it is doubtful that many of us outside the city will shed many tears. For too long, brain drain to the capital has deprived the rest of the UK and its local economies of graduates and young people. Capital spending on infrastructure in London is 10 times higher than the East Midlands. HS3, the flagship railway line for the construction of the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d hangs in the balance, while electrification plans for Sheffield and Cardiff have been shelved. Despite steps to remedy the inequality, Arts Council funding remains extraordinarily weighted in favour of London, and of the \u201chigh\u201d culture institutions that are based there. What places such as Margate, Birmingham and Manchester offer, in contrast, is an opportunity to eke out space for their own grassroots cultural activities. Such activities depend on two things: cheap living costs that enable people to commit time to unremunerated cultural activities, and low-cost space for studios, performance spaces, galleries and nightclubs. It\u2019s likely that we will see a proliferation of regional grassroots cultural spaces as young creative people forsake London in favour of other cities. Partisan collective, a new worker and member-owned co-operative arts and social club in Manchester is one such space. In February 2016, 50 people, including many new arrivals in the city, met in the back room of a Northern Quarter pub to discuss the possibility of setting up a collectively owned arts venue. Eighteen months later, having secured a space in the city centre, they opened their doors with a weekend-long festival of music, film, workshops and discussions. New venues such as The White Hotel, Mantra and the fully wheelchair-accessible Texture have all emerged in Manchester over the last few years. Meat Free, an all-female promoter collective, run hugely popular not-for-profit electronic music nights. The Real Junk Food project has recently set up shop east of the city centre, recycling waste food in their pay-as-you-feel restaurant. A band threatened with losing their practice space above the Old Abbey Taphouse simply took over the pub. There\u2019s a thriving and growing underground queer scene, with Vice recently dubbing Salford \u201cthe most exciting place to party in the UK right now\u201d. Manchester\u2019s current artistic renaissance has been driven in part by the presence of young, energetic people committed to grassroots and alternative culture. But it\u2019s not all a bed of roses, according to Partisan member Chiara Knott, pointing out the proliferation of high-rise blocks of expensive apartments and hoardings advertising \u201cluxury living in heart of the city\u201d. Having moved back to Manchester after a decade away, she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve found a city in crisis. There\u2019s lots of development but none of it is for us, we can\u2019t afford it. Who is it for? We can\u2019t afford to buy a home, our favourite venues are having to fight for their licences.\u201d And what about the proposed \u00a378m government investment in the new \u201cFactory\u201d cultural centre and the biennial Manchester International Festival? \u201cReal culture,\u201d Chiara says, \u201chappens in communities, not galleries.\u201d Property development is part and parcel of the Manchester \u201cmiracle\u201d, as overseas investment floods into the city and the skyline is a forest of cranes. Surely this is a good thing? Landlords and developers think so. Manchester and Salford now offer the highest yields for buy-to-let properties in the country. At nearly 7%, these are double the current London yield: same investment, twice the profits. So, as Landlord Today unrepentantly advises: \u201cIt could be time for landlords to turn their attention away from pricey London and look to the UK\u2019s regional cities.\u201d However, as the example of London demonstrates, one person\u2019s boom is another\u2019s crisis. Despite, or perhaps because of, the real estate boom, homelessness in Manchester has increased by 33% in just the last year. So, where next? If Manchester becomes a giant monument to Qatari capital and the hubris of retired footballers, where will be the next place providing cheap living costs and affordable space to those invested in creating independent culture? Bradford has a growing arts scene in the shell of its magnificent industrial architecture. Hull is the UK City of Culture. But how can we stop the cannibalisation of that culture by real estate markets? How can we stop the expulsion of the very same people who make the city an exciting place to live? These are not rhetorical questions. The answers should be self-evident. The solution is not for people and families to constantly jump ship, shoved from pillar to post on a dusty road in an endless search for affordable housing. Infrastructure and public spending must be redistributed across the country. Central government and local authorities must take steps to protect underground cultural spaces from destructive market forces. In Berlin, techno clubs are considered to have cultural significance and given protected tax status. The grand council of the night works directly with local authorities to defend the liberties of those engaged in night culture. These aren\u2019t utopian dreams, they are political decisions. Above all, homes should no longer be treated as commodities, sold off as empty shells for investors to store their wealth. A mass project of social housing is needed to hold communities together and to act as a buffer against the hollowing out of the city by global capital. As we say in Manchester, Our Homes Are Not Your Assets. \u2022 Kate Hardy is associate professor and lecturer in work and employment relations at the University of Leeds; Tom Gillespie is an urban geographer at the University of Manchester"
"12||Bullying, cliques and fistfights: secrets from Eden, the reality show that nobody watched\u201cPeople like the blood and guts,\u201d says Raph, a wry 55-year-old carpenter from east London. \u201cThey\u2019re going to want to know what went wrong.\u201d Sitting next to him is Anton, 42, an imposing boatman. \u201cWe had the opportunity to show some of humanity\u2019s strengths, when we really showed a lot of society\u2019s weaknesses.\u201d The pair are survivors of Eden, Channel 4\u2019s much-trumpeted social experiment-cum-reality show. In March 2016, 23 people selected for their specific skills (doctor, shepherdess, plumber and so on) were sent to a stretch of shoreline in the Highlands and given basic tools and supplies to build a self-sufficient community, cut off from society for a year. The outside world received its first dispatch last July, whereupon things quickly went awry on and off screen. Ratings tumbled from 1.7 million to 800,000 over four episodes as the community splintered. Having launched the series by asking: \u201cWhat if we could start again?\u201d, Channel 4 executives could have been forgiven for wondering the same. Eden\u2019s social media accounts went silent and a year passed with no updates. Rumours that the series had been canned were refuted by the broadcaster and, on 23 March this year, the survivors \u2013 all 10 of them \u2013 emerged. What on earth happened? \u201cIt became so different to what we imagined,\u201d says the broadcaster\u2019s commissioning editor, Ian Dunkley. \u201cWe wanted to focus on the strongest stories and characters, and we could only be sure of that once the year had played out. I don\u2019t think anyone expected it to go as feral and dark as it did.\u201d This is not mere marketing spiel. Five new episodes document bullying, cliques, fistfights and even outright revolt as male boorishness descended into disturbing misogyny. Some women were picked on for their perceived physical weakness and advised to stick to basic chores while a few male hunter-gatherers did the manual labour. It was claimed that the men controlling access to food were threatening to \u201cstarve them out\u201d. Raph, one of Eden\u2019s cussedly independent spirits, acknowledges the schism. \u201cHunger was a big issue. If I\u2019m doing the work and you\u2019re not, and we\u2019re going to eat the same meal, that fuels problems. You could see the changes in people, who\u2019s siding up to who to make sure they\u2019re going to get fed, who\u2019s going to go without.\u201d He looks sheepish. \u201cI went in wanting to help everyone and share my skills, but that turned into: if I do this for you, I can get that\u2026\u201d By the time we see a moonshine-fuelled birthday party with a caveman theme and one woman is asked: \u201cHow do you feel about anal?\u201d, \u201cdark\u201d and \u201cferal\u201d seem like understatements. Certainly, none of Eden\u2019s women came out unscathed. For Katie at least, talking about it is cathartic. \u201cIt\u2019s still raw as hell,\u201d says the 31-year-old artist and marine conservationist. \u201cI feel nervous and shaky every time I think about watching it. I live among crofters and I\u2019ve worked with the military but I\u2019ve never been limited by gender, so it was a shock. \u201cWhat that group of boys had in common was insecurity, a need to prove themselves with a show of ego and arrogance to hide their emotions and nervousness. They didn\u2019t have the emotional literacy of boys like Rob [the community vet who became Katie\u2019s boyfriend] \u2013 he cried when a baby lamb was born. He\u2019s slightly traumatised by the whole thing [Eden] and prefers not to talk about it.\u201d It was not just the women who suffered as the idyll soured. Community outcast-cum-scapegoat Anton retreated to the woods to build his own cabin as the same faction looked to, as Katie puts it, \u201cpick off the vulnerable\u201d. \u201cI did struggle with depression and anxiety early on,\u201d says Anton, his sanguine nature belied by the haunted look in his eyes. \u201cBut I saw it as a job, an amazing opportunity that was mine to take, not throw away. Walking out crossed my mind, but with every person that left, I\u2019d get stronger \u2013 it was like I\u2019d beaten them.\u201d While this competitive element pulled Anton through, it also made building a functioning community almost impossible. \u201cThe idea of survival was one of our biggest problems,\u201d Katie says. \u201cSome of us thought it might test how we could live closer to nature, others looked at it as a competition. People were trying to prove how tough they were rather than investing time in finding the usefulness of others and helping them through it. \u201cAt the beginning, a lot of the men went for the macho jobs, chopping logs and building stuff, whereas the gardening was \u2018women\u2019s work\u2019 \u2013 no glory but a daily trudge. They said we were lazy, and these weird words like \u2018efficiency\u2019 and \u2018cull\u2019 were used. Eventually, if the group thinks something\u2019s OK, it becomes OK.\u201d The integrity of the project rested on the community being left to its own devices. Series producer Liz Foley insists they would have stepped in \u201cif someone had been in mortal danger or was desperately traumatised\u201d, yet should the moral imperative to intervene have taken precedence over the professional one to simply document events? It was a dilemma 43-year-old Jane, one of four embedded camera crew, felt keenly. \u201cPart of my job was to maintain relationships so I could get the story,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf I had said how I felt as a community member, I would have shut down barriers to people. As a woman, I regret not feeling able to stand up for what I believed in 100%. As a professional cameraperson, I\u2019m quite proud. But I struggle with that on a daily basis.\u201d For all its highfalutin ambition, perhaps Eden, like so many reality shows before it, simply boils down to another unedifying demonstration of how horrible human beings can be to each other. So what is the value in watching it? Eden is undoubtedly a series for its times, where bullies shout down experts and conversation is infected with mansplaining and \u201cbanter\u201d, where prime ministers talk about \u201cboy jobs\u201d and \u201cgirl jobs\u201d and misogyny surfaces everywhere from our national broadcaster to, it seems, remote Scottish communities. Of course, Eden lacked the established laws, governmental mechanisms and mixed demographics (Jane and Anton were the only fortysomethings, Raph the only Edenite over 50) of the real world that might have checked the truly revolting behaviour. Yet the picture it paints of modern manhood is an indubitably dispiriting one. \u201cStrip everything back and perhaps people go to areas of their psyche they didn\u2019t know they had,\u201d muses Jane. \u201cIt\u2019s sickening that it\u2019s 2017 and we still have these attitudes. I hope this becomes a national conversation, because it does shine a light on where we\u2019re at. We\u2019ve got so much further to go and so much more work to do.\u201d It wasn\u2019t all bad. For Anton, Eden provided \u201can opportunity for me to see if I had developed into the person I am now, much better than the person I used to be\u201d. Raph has a new perspective on life: \u201cI wake up every morning with a smile on my face. I know I can survive anything.\u201d Jane delighted herself by \u201cdigging deep\u201d, getting through it and learning unlikely skills including tree-felling and fire-starting. Katie built a house, met her boyfriend and argues the programme serves a vital purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating as an anthropological experiment: how we live, struggles for power, for food, for sex \u2026 If you want to see how human beings work, that\u2019s it.\u201d Startlingly, all four maintain that it is still possible to start again. \u201cBecause otherwise,\u201d says Jane, \u201chumanity\u2019s doomed.\u201d Eden: Paradise Lost starts on 7 August at 10pm on Channel 4"
"19||Brexit uncertainty blamed as UK car sales fall for fourth monthNew car sales in the UK have fallen for the fourth month running, as Brexit uncertainty weighs on demand and buyers shun diesel cars in greater numbers. Sales fell 9.3% in July to 161,997 new cars as consumers and businesses grew increasingly reluctant to commit to major spending decisions. \u201cThe fall in consumer and business confidence is having a knock-on effect on demand in the new car market and the government must act quickly to provide concrete plans regarding Brexit,\u201d said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which published the figures. Sales of diesel cars were down by a fifth in July compared with a year earlier, to 69,157. Hawes blamed uncertainty over clean-air plans in the UK, after the government announced proposals to ban all new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040 amid fears that rising levels of nitrogen oxide posed a major risk to public health. Sales of new petrol cars were also down in July, falling 3% to 83,969. While diesel and petrol sales fell in July, there was a sharp rise in the sale of new alternatively fuelled vehicles, up 65% compared with the same month last year to 8,871. AFVs accounted for 5.5% of all new car sales in July, which was a record high. The fall in new car sales in recent months has brought to an end to five years of growth \u2013 fuelled by cheap car finance deals \u2013 which has helped to underpin the consumer-led growth in the wider economy. However, household budgets are coming under renewed pressure as prices rise faster than wages, signalling a return to the fall in real pay that hit workers in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Bank of England said on Thursday that businesses were also less willing to spend money at a time of persistent uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. New car sales are now down 2.2% in 2017 so far, to 1.56m. The SMMT is forecasting a 2.6% drop in sales in 2017 overall, following a record 2.6m registrations in 2016. In July, sales fell across the UK, by 13.7% in Scotland, 12.5% in Wales, 9% in England, and 2.3% in Northern Ireland. Alex Buttle, director at car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, said the industry could be heading for a sharp downturn. He said: \u201c2017 is starting to feel like the auto industry\u2019s annus horribilis. This could be the beginning of a deep recession for the new car industry, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen since the credit crunch. \u201cDiesel D-day might be over 20 years away, but we could see new car sales continuing to fall by 10-20% a month in the near term. After all, who is going to want to buy a diesel car now - especially with the prospect of paying a hefty toxin tax in the future and falling resale values?\u201d Hawes said weaker demand for new cars should result in some cheap deals for consumers. \u201cThe lower demand in recent months will inevitably mean competition from manufacturers will intensify and it will be a good opportunity for consumers to get a great deal on their next car.\u201d The National Franchised Dealers Association said the government would need to invest more in electric vehicle infrastructure, such as car charging points, to meet growth in the alternative fuel market. The top three bestsellers in July were the Ford Focus, Volkswagen Golf, and Nissan Qashqai.

"24||Steeplechase athlete Ieuan Thomas: 'The World Championships make it all worth it'Hi, Ieuan. What have you been up to recently? So much! My girlfriend and I were in London last weekend to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. And then it has just been working, running, eating \u2026 Any big races coming up? Yeah, you could say that. Biggest race of my life, I guess. World Athletics Championships steeplechase in front of a home crowd. That\u2019s pretty much as big as it gets, right? Where\u2019s your favourite place to run? I spent a year at Western State Colorado University, and the running trails were just incredible. When the weather was nice, we would do 16-, 18-mile Sunday runs at 8-10,000ft and we wouldn\u2019t touch the same patch of trail twice. You\u2019d just be running through these mountains with these panoramic views, and you just had this amazing feeling of freedom. Racing-wise, I love racing at the track in Oordegem [Belgium]. It\u2019s where my current personal best was set. After this weekend, though, I could very well have a new favourite track! Do you remember your first-ever race? We used to have an \u201cendurance\u201d race in my primary-school sports day. It was probably only 200m or so \u2013 around a tree and back. I won that! That\u2019s my first racing memory. I also remember a 5k one year when my family was on holiday at Walt Disney World in Florida. I must have been about 12 and ran about 21 minutes or so in an old pair of trainers and some jogging bottoms. Then there was high-school cross country. I came third in one race and got an invitation to run for east Wales, which at the time was a massive deal. I was still running in football boots, and lost one in a really muddy section, so slipped the other shoe off and ran about a quarter of the race shoeless. How did you make the switch from cross-country to steeplechase? One of the guys I lived with at university was a steeplechaser \u2013 I\u2019d always joke with him that I could beat him. Eventually, I had to put my money where my mouth was. I got a spot at the Welsh inter-regionals in the 2k chase. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d ever jumped a barrier before! It still took a few more years before I took it seriously, though. What\u2019s different about steeplechase training compared with \u201cstandard\u201d track racing? I don\u2019t do many different workouts to the rest of the group during the winter \u2013 we\u2019re all trying to build similar bases \u2013 but once it gets to the summer, things really break up. We\u2019ll try to mix in my hurdle sessions with normal group sessions \u2013 I\u2019ll hurdle in lane two, then swing back into lane one to run with the main pack and then swing back out to lane two. Then, on the rare occasion we can get the water pit filled, I\u2019ll do some post-session or post-run water-jump practice. When people ask you for a training tip, what do you tell them? Usually something about variation and mixing up training to get the maximum effect. Making hard days hard and easy days easy. Far too many people try to go out and run a personal best every weekend \u2013 you need adaptation time for training, and also sufficient rest to make sure your hard sessions are quality. I don\u2019t like to dish out generic advice because I\u2019m just an athlete and not a qualified coach. Everything I know comes from my own experiences and from the amazing people I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to work with. Do you ever struggle with motivation? Absolutely. There are definitely days when I just can\u2019t bear the thought of getting out of bed. But I\u2019ve never missed a major run or workout because I just didn\u2019t fancy it. The sessions are a social occasion for me as much as anything. It\u2019s just those early mornings in the winter when it\u2019s dark and cold, and my bed is so comfy that motivation wanes. Then, of course, any time you\u2019re injured, you question why you go through it all. Then things like the World Athletics Championship selection happen and it proves it is all worth it, at least to me. Do you listen to music when you run? If I\u2019m on my own on a long run or I need a little extra motivation on a hard, solo tempo. I\u2019m a big fan of musicals, so if I\u2019m in the right mood I\u2019ll pop some Les Mis or Wicked on the iPod. Most of the time it\u2019s just on shuffle, though. Do you like a particular running gadget? I absolutely love my Garmin because of the amount of functionality it has, and I\u2019ll always look back over runs to analyse pace, work rate, gradients etc, but I try not to overthink it too much. I do a fair amount of training to heart rate, too, just so I know exactly how hard I\u2019m working \u2013 I like to feel that every gadget serves a purpose. What\u2019s the worst thing about running? Early mornings in the winter. And not being able to go on holiday whenever you want. What\u2019s the best thing? The satisfaction of success, whether it\u2019s your own or that of your team-mates. The guys I train with are my best friends and running is our social time. We don\u2019t spend time in pubs and clubs \u2013 we run instead \u2013 so it brings me a lot of joy to see any of my training partners succeed because I feel part of it. My world champs selection belongs to the whole of Team Thie because I wouldn\u2019t be the same athlete without them. What\u2019s your post-race indulgence? An ice-cold beer or a glass of Penderyn single malt whisky. Bliss. What do you eat for breakfast before your big runs or a big race? If it\u2019s a morning or early afternoon race then breakfast might be my only meal, so I\u2019ll load up suitably. I\u2019m a big fan of peanut butter and jam bagels. If it\u2019s a later race, I might have egg and beans with toast or a bowl of mixed cereal. Have you ever run barefoot? I\u2019ll sometimes do my cool-down barefoot on the grass, or do some strides after a run. I wasn\u2019t someone who bought into the barefoot running craze when it started, though. As much as I appreciate the theory behind it, my Sauconys are far too comfortable. I believe anyone who wants to try barefoot running needs to do it very carefully. If you had to choose who to watch, would it be Mo or Usain? Just from a patriotic perspective, I have to say Mo. There is never going to be another Bolt, and his character has added so much to this sport that I love. But I am a distance runner at heart so love watching the longer races. When both of them are gone from the track there is going to be a serious void to fill. Who is your favourite-ever runner? That\u2019s pretty hard. Kenenisa Bekele, in my opinion, is the greatest runner of all time and inspired me massively. But most distance runners will say Steve Prefontaine. The cult of Pre definitely sucked me in at a young age. Then you can\u2019t forget Welsh greats such as Steve Jones and my current coach, James Thie. I grew up watching James run, and, as an aspiring middle distance athlete, he was definitely my favourite runner. These days we\u2019re great friends, and he is a fantastic coach and mentor."
"26||Behold the Dreamers by Imbolo Mbue review \u2013 an impressive debutSo charged has the word \u201cmigrant\u201d become that I hesitate to call Imbolo Mbue\u2019s impressive debut a migrant novel; yet all the ingredients are there. The protagonist Jende Jonga is, like Mbue, a Cameroonian migrant to America along with his wife Neni and their six-year old son Liomi. And Clark Edwards, Jende\u2019s boss, an investment banker, is also a migrant, coming to Wall Street from the American hinterland; his ancestors were once newcomers with funny accents and funnier customs. The novel begins with an interview. Clark needs a driver and Jende needs a job. In this opening exchange, power, the central theme of the novel, is laid bare. For Clark, the interview is a blip in his busy day. To Jende, in his carefully chosen clothes and with his carefully doctored CV, it is the only way to sustain life for him and his family. Yet Jende is not the na\u00eff he appears, despite his gauche green suit and wide-eyed reaction to office furniture. If the American immigration system is a powerful machine, those trapped inside it are not entirely powerless. The system can be played. Along with his immigration lawyer, Jende has decided to seek asylum and concoct a tale to go with his application, complete with a father-in-law who is trying to kill him. While Jende is waiting for the result of his asylum application, he settles self-effacingly into his job, offering up stories of his homeland for his boss\u2019s amusement (\u201cLimbe is very special, Mr Edwards. In Limbe, we live simple lives, but we enjoy our lives well\u2019). Jende is a small man at work, at the beck and call of Clark, his wife Cindy and their two sons; but he is a big man at home. The humiliations of being a driver allow him to pay his wife\u2019s college tuition and send money back to Cameroon. But it is 2008 and Clark works for Lehman Brothers. Clark too is trapped in a powerful system, this time a financial one, and there is little room for manoeuvre. The reader foresees the gathering storm but is powerless to stop it. This is not a story of noble immigrants versus the evil banking class: Mbue is too skilful for that. The Edwardses are self-absorbed and selfish but slim bridges of genuine affection exist between them and the Jongas. On the other hand, the Jongas are not simple Africans who eschew materialism and can teach the Edwardses how to live a contented life. Both Jende and Neni rejoice in the consumerism of America and grasp at all that capitalism has to offer. Sometimes, the pace becomes sluggish as yet another set piece scene of cultural exchange occurs. In one episode, the reader laughs at Jende\u2019s expense as he ponders over the phrase \u201ccooked books\u201d. In another, Jende tells the Edwardses older son that in Cameroon he would be whipped by his parents for wanting to quit law school. Mbue\u2019s prose is mostly straightforward and unadorned but her characters are complex, with contradictory motivations, which provide the story with depth and quiet power. The novel was called The Longings of Jende Jonga when it sold for seven figures. There\u2019s a jaunty catchiness to this discarded title, yet Behold the Dreamers is a more fitting name. Who are the dreamers? Jende and Neni, who believe that through hard work and luck they can force their way into the American dream? Or we, the readers, who close our eyes to the Jendes in our midst, lulling ourselves into inertia with dreams of peace and security? \u2022 Chibundu Onuzo\u2019s Welcome to Lagos is published by Faber.

"13||Bop till you drop: the staggering true stories behind America's dance marathonsIn 1933, 14-year-old Anita O\u2019Day went home to her Chicago apartment and told her mother that she was dropping out of school to go dancing. For 24 hours a day, seven days a week. She was to be part of an endurance spectacle that had taken a feverish grip on the nation, the dance marathon, where couples would dance non-stop for days, weeks, even months, to try to win a huge cash prize. \u201cThey feed you seven times a day and see that you get free medical care,\u201d she told her mother, which proved good selling points in a time of severe financial crisis. For O\u2019Day, a \u201cprofessional\u201d contestant who had answered an ad in Billboard magazine and sang numbers with the band for extra cash, this was the beginning of a lauded jazz singing career. For others, the dance marathon remains the embodiment of Depression-era desperation, serving up suffering as entertainment and exposing the lengths to which people will go when they\u2019ve got nothing to lose, just for the glimmer of financial redemption. O\u2019Day\u2019s marathon career came to an end two years later when a truant officer spotted her and sent her back to school. Her last big event was in Springfield, Illinois, where she and her partner danced for 97 days, covering 4,656 miles in 2,328 hours. They came second. The dance marathon was a short-lived phenomenon that has lingered long in the popular imagination. Its most famous fictional incarnation is Horace McCoy\u2019s 1935 novel, They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?, and Sidney Pollack\u2019s film adaptation, from 1969, with an Oscar-nominated performance from Jane Fonda. McCoy had worked as a bouncer on Santa Monica pier, where marathons were held, and that experience formed the basis for his story of a naive young couple, Robert and Gloria, who escape from the problems of the world outside into a world of competition that turns out to be just as brutal. Simone de Beauvoir called it America\u2019s first existentialist novel, and the slim book\u2019s story has remained potent. It\u2019s been transferred to the theatre \u2013 Northern Stage made an atmospheric production in 1995 \u2013 and its theme has continued to inspire, whether in choreographer Arthur Pita\u2019s Nobody\u2019s Baby (2014), Alexander McQueen\u2019s spring 2004 catwalk or one of the best episodes of noughties drama Gilmore Girls. Now the dance marathon has inspired a new theatre piece, No Miracles Here, which opens at the Edinburgh fringe this summer. It was created by young Newcastle company The Letter Room, six actor-musicians who devise theatre pieces around live music. They started with the idea of depression, but this time it was not to do with a tanked economy, but with mental health. \u201cWe were talking about how sometimes when you\u2019re depressed it\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ve just got to keep going, don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop\u2019,\u201d says performer Meghan Doyle. The idea of desperation and hope that\u2019s embedded in the marathon reeled the group in. However, they\u2019re not making a period piece, but drawing on music that got people\u2019s feet moving throughout the last century, particularly Northern Soul. For them, this is not just a story of endurance but one with a more positive message of finding a community on the dancefloor. \u201cThe highs and lows of it,\u201d says Doyle. \u201cHow dancing just makes you feel so alive, that\u2019s the feeling we wanted to capture.\u201d The company will be boogying non-stop throughout the show, as well as playing their instruments, although only two of the six are experienced dancers. The others, well ... \u201cThat phrase \u2018dance like no one\u2019s watching, that\u2019s Stan\u201d, says Doyle, pointing to fellow performer Stan Hodgson. \u201cNapoleon Dynamite is probably my dancing spirit animal,\u201d Hodgson agrees. In the show, they will only be dancing for an hour, whereas the original dance marathons lasted for hundreds of hours. \u201cBut maybe by the last day of the fringe we might feel close to that,\u201d says Doyle. No Miracles Here is a world away from the marathons of the 1930s, but there is a connection in its north-east provenance, because the history of dance marathons actually begins not in the US but in Sunderland, where on 18 February 1923, Olie Finnerty and Edgar Van Ollefin set a record by dancing seven hours without stopping. It was part of a broader 1920s craze for all sorts of record-breaking feats \u2013 flagpole sitting, endurance kissing, egg eating, gum chewing \u2013 with Americans in particular keen to prove their prowess in pointless occupations. Twelve days after Finnerty and Van Ollefin\u2019s modest feat, Alma Cummings took the lead by dancing for 27 hours at the Audubon Ballroom in New York, and a frenzy of competitors across the US were inspired to challenge her. Within a couple of months the record was broken almost daily, rising to 56 hours, 69 hours, 82 hours, and the first voices of disquiet about this \u201cdancing plague\u201d began to emerge, especially after a man called Homer Morehouse died of heart failure after dancing for 87 hours. \u201cA dance epidemic always precedes national disaster, as clouds precede a storm,\u201d Mina Van Winkle of the Washington DC police told the New York Times. And disaster was indeed looming: in 1929 Wall Street crashed, unemployment and poverty set in and savvy promoters turned this entertainment phenomenon into a kind of Darwinian theatre, and a grim profit machine. In this professionalised era, marathons, or walkathons, would move from town to town like the circus. Prize money reached into the thousands but, regardless of winning, dancers would at least be provided with food and shelter as long as they were there. Rules began to be standardised, generally giving couples 15 minutes\u2019 rest per hour, meaning that the competitions could last much longer, up to 12 weeks. Dancers reported hallucinations but as long as they were on their feet, moving with their partner, they stayed in. With competitions lasting so long, things had to be kept entertaining. Elimination sprints, or \u201cgrinds\u201d, were introduced, with couples running circuits around the dancefloor, sometimes blindfolded, chained together or running backwards. There were stunts such as being \u201cfrozen alive\u201d, with competitors encased in blocks of ice and paid a dollar a minute for as long as they could last, plus whatever money the audience threw on the floor in encouragement. Medical staff were on hand, partly for safety, but partly for theatre, to maximise the feeling of peril. There were live bands and singers, sketches, raffles, mud-wrestling even. A raft of professional marathoners such as O\u2019Day emerged, hoping to use the exposure to launch their showbiz careers. Soapy dramas, rivalries and love affairs would develop between hammed-up characters on the dancefloor. Some couples would go from venue to venue, pretending to meet on the dancefloor, fall in love and get engaged, with fake (and sometimes real) weddings taking place in the ballroom and the couple bagging lucrative wedding presents from the crowd. It was a world of artifice and opportunism, desperate escapism and just plain desperation. And did anybody ever get the fabled grand prize money? That\u2019s not always clear. But what\u2019s interesting is that the audience weren\u2019t completely being conned. They knew there was fakery and they enjoyed the pretence, but they also knew that the blisters, the sweat, the exhaustion were all real. As Carol Martin says in Dance Marathons, her excellent history of the phenomenon: \u201cDance marathons presented life lived as theatre. Spectators simultaneously believed and disbelieved. It was a position Bertolt Brecht would have appreciated: the enjoyment of an aesthetic phenomenon only partly masked as a real-life event.\u201d That world may seem alien and inhuman to us now, but arguably its essence has flourished more than ever in the last couple of decades, to be found in the form of reality TV. Taking pleasure in other people\u2019s discomfort is the cornerstone of I\u2019m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!, where competitors eat bugs and entrails for our entertainment, and are pushed to the edge of madness with tiredness and hunger. In Big Brother, characters play to the camera, forming factions and having rivalries and love affairs. In 2004\u2019s Shattered, contestants had to stay awake for seven days in the hope of winning a \u00a3100,000 prize fund. Touch the Truck (2001) required them to hold on to an expensive vehicle, and the last one standing got to take it home. All of these shows offer viewers the chance to goggle at the trials of others from the comfort of their living room. But the endurance challenge pulls people off the sofa too, in the fast-growing business of ultramarathons and Ironman triathlons. In what is, relatively speaking, a time of material comfort, we\u2019re still gripped by the idea of pushing ourselves beyond normal human barriers, or at least watching other people do so. \u201cThere was that famous image recently of the guy carrying the other guy across the line at the London marathon,\u201d says Doyle, just as triathlete Alistair Brownlee did for brother Jonny in Mexico. It\u2019s the equivalent of the photos of exhausted dance marathon couples holding each other up on the dancefloor, she points out, with the audience willing them to just get over the line. \u201cWe like that idea that someone coming to see our show would have that same will for a character,\u201d says Hodgson. \u201cThat they\u2019d be shouting, \u2018Come on, just get through this!\u2019\u201d No Miracles Here is at Northern Stage at Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 26 August"

"0||Follywood: how Valerian earns its place among film's strangest big-budget flopsAs a hack auteur, prolific writer, director and producer, Luc Besson is a seeming contradiction. He\u2019s spent his career churning out grubby, insanely commercial genre movies, such as his Taken trilogy. But within those categories, Besson manages to invest an awful lot of personality and eccentricity. Besson may specialize in trash, but at his best, he makes trash with heart and soul. When Besson is working on a big canvas, as with 1997\u2019s The Fifth Element, a film with the straight-faced audacity to posit that love truly is the fifth element, it becomes impossible to deny his auteur status. Two decades after The Fifth Element was a worldwide box-office success and attained instant cult classic status, Besson has made another magnum opus, another labor of love, another movie that is so personal that it\u2019s essentially Luc Besson in cinematic form, in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. Only this time, the critics have their knives out and audiences are staying away (the film has scraped a 51% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has only made back a fifth of its $177m budget worldwide). This is particularly bad news for Besson, who invested his own money into the movie along with his heart and soul, making this the most expensive independent film of all time and not one that looks likely to ever turn a profit. It\u2019s easy to see why Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets is bombing hard. For starters, it\u2019s called Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, a name that means nothing to American audiences. Like other high-profile, auteurist, director-driven science fiction flops such as Sucker Punch, Chappie, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and Jupiter Ascending, Valerian is audacious, original and ambitious to a fault. Like those oddball flops, it\u2019s clearly the work of an auteur willing to pursue his creative vision even if makes him seem ridiculous and laughable. From a commercial standpoint, Valerian shares a problem with the aforementioned films that, creatively, at least, should be a virtue: it\u2019s too original. In a world of cookie-cutter entertainment, it makes the mistake of straying from formula, and paid a steep price for its deviation. These oddball science fiction flops are original in sometimes perversely derivative ways. Chappie, for example, is morbidly fascinating in part because it doesn\u2019t borrow so much as it steals shamelessly from the earlier blockbusters Short Circuit and Robocop as well as the mythology and stage personas of the highly theatrical South African rap duo Die Antwoord, who unwisely star as fictionalized version of themselves. But amid this flagrant thievery, the writer-director Neill Blomkamp, who had slightly more success with District 9, has created something utterly distinctive and unique. It\u2019s unlike any movie ever made, even the movies it rips off. The audacity of Blomkamp\u2019s vision is a wonder to behold. Just as Chappie\u2019s DNA comes from Robocop and Short Circuit and the theatricality of South African hip-hop, Jupiter Ascending bears such a strong resemblance to the Matrix trilogy that its writer-directors, the Wachowski sisters, might have been tempted to sue for plagiarism if they hadn\u2019t written and directed those movies as well. Only instead of Keanu Reeves as Neo, Jupiter Ascending has Mila Kunis as a toilet-scrubber on Earth with a secret destiny as a space queen and Channing Tatum, in the role no one will remember him for, as a heroic outer space dog-man with magic flying boots. Needless to say, this resulted in a much crazier, much less commercial and infinitely less successful exercise in world-building than The Matrix but also one with a whole lot of demented charm and personality. Like Chappie, Jupiter Ascending is deeply personal in a way that makes its surreal awfulness oddly charming. The Wachowskis began their career with great films like Bound and The Matrix. These days, they have to settle for \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d. In between making billion-dollar superhero movies nobody likes, and also movies about the Guardians of Ga\u2019Hoole, the DC Cinematic Universe maestro Zack Snyder decided to make an overly personal, audacious, convention-defying oddball science fiction cult item of his own with 2011\u2019s Sucker Punch. The movie has a curiously bifurcated reputation. On the surface, Snyder\u2019s film looks like an unselfconscious, over-the-top exercise in comic-book sexism, voyeurism and misogyny featuring scantily clad nymphets bumping and grinding when not marauding their way through violent fantasy scenarios involving robots and tanks and steampunk and plenty of other nonsense that gives fanboys hard-ons. Yet Snyder has insisted that his film is actually a meta exploration and condemnation of fanboy sexism and voyeurism cunningly masquerading as the ultimate in pandering. Sucker Punch is a curious beast. It\u2019s all about spectacle and visuals, yet it\u2019s only interesting as a film of ideas, and those ideas are incredibly muddled and self-contradicting. Snyder might have thought that he Trojan-horsed a scathing condemnation of misogyny and de-humanization inside a movie designed to appeal almost exclusively to the sexist nerds it was in fact condemning, but the result feels awfully misogynistic all the same. With their extensive use of CGI and green screen, movies like Valerian and Sucker Punch are following in the footsteps of Kerry Conran\u2019s ill-fated 2004 science fiction fantasy Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, which used green screen not just for specific effects but to create an entire world. The world Conran and his collaborators created out of old Superman cartoons, adventure serials, the original King Kong and a whole lot of newfangled technology is visually dazzling but occupied by characters it\u2019s impossible to care about. As with all of the other audacious sci-fi flops I\u2019ve written about here, there\u2019s a profound disconnect between the film\u2019s visual mastery and its relative indifference to everything else. That\u2019s true of Valerian as well. Valerian has the courage of its fearsome convictions, and if you\u2019re willing to overlook things like acting, plot, characterization, dialogue, character arcs, pacing, structure and leads, as many science fiction die-hards are willing to do, then Valerian is a nifty spectacle that excels as eye-candy even if it comes up short in every other respect. When the eye candy is as impressive as a dazzling set-piece where Rihanna, playing a character who is essentially both a commentary on the singer-actress\u2019s public persona and a shape-shifting alien, morphs from one sexy, surreal getup to another, seemingly changing the very fabric of reality with her sensuality, the trade-off of everything for breathtaking visuals seems worth it. The nice thing about science fiction movies as loopy and ingratiatingly heartfelt as Valerian, Sucker Punch, Jupiter Ascending, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and Chappie is that they don\u2019t necessarily have to be good to find cult followings and attain cult classic status. I would have a hard time characterizing any of these movies as good, but that sure hasn\u2019t kept them from becoming cult films, and Valerian is on its way to cult status as well. When it comes to crazy science fiction movies and cult followings, in many ways it\u2019s better to be audaciously bad than good, and Valerian, like the earlier movies I\u2019ve written about here, is noteworthy both for its audacity and for its badness. I\u2019m glad these crazy, audacious, personal projects exist because they make the often boring and predictable world of popcorn entertainment crazier and more interesting. Yet I also very much intend to never see any of these movies ever again. Sober, at least."

"4||Labour MPs ask Corbyn to commit to free movement post-BrexitA band of Labour MPs and trade unionists are calling for Jeremy Corbyn to commit to defending free movement when the UK leaves the EU, highlighting the party\u2019s split over the issue. Clive Lewis, an ally of Corbyn, has joined David Lammy and Geraint Davies in signing a open letter in support of letting UK and other EU citizens continue to live and work across the bloc without barriers. Labour\u2019s official position, like the government\u2019s, is that free movement will end at the point of Brexit in March 2019, but it has not backed a particular immigration system to replace it. Many MPs with seats in Labour\u2019s Brexit-voting heartlands in the north and Midlands are keen for tighter restrictions on immigration to show the party listened to a key message of the EU referendum. But Corbyn and his shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, have always been supportive of the aims of free movement of people and have declined to say that immigration overall should fall. In their open letter, the MPs, national executive members, Momentum organisers and trade unionists, called on Labour to \u201crespond with clarity, humanity and solidarity\u201d on the issue of immigration. \u201cMigrants are not to blame for falling wages, insecurity, bad housing and overstretched public services,\u201d they said. \u201cThese are the product of decades of underinvestment, deregulation, privatisation, and the harshest anti-union laws in Europe. On the contrary, migrant workers have been on the frontline of fighting for better pay and working conditions. Labour is the party of all working people \u2013 regardless of where they were born. \u201cA system of free movement is the best way to protect and advance the interests of all workers, by giving everyone the right to work legally, join a union and stand up to their boss without fear of deportation or destitution. Curtailing those rights, or limiting migrants\u2019 access to public services and benefits, will make it easier for unscrupulous employers to hyper-exploit migrant labour, which in turn undermines the rights and conditions of all workers.\u201d Michael Chessum, an organiser for the Labour Campaign for Free Movement, said he was concerned that \u201cLabour\u2019s immigration stance has for far too long been dominated by pandering to the idea that immigration is to blame for a fall in living standards\u201d. He said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just factually wrong, it\u2019s also self-defeating - because we need a narrative that is clear and honest about the fact that neoliberalism and exploitation are the real problem. That has to be backed up with policy, not just sentiment. We beat the Tories when we\u2019re principled and offer alternatives \u2013 that\u2019s the lesson of the general election.\u201d"
"29||Garma festival: Gumatj clan lead emotional tribute to Dr G YunupinguThere were many tears shed at the opening of the 19th Garma festival, as the Gumatj clan \u2013 on whose land the event is held \u2013 paid tribute to singer and cultural ambassador, Dr G Yunupingu, who died last week at the age of 46. As his brothers sang a reworked Dr G song about fire, sending the words into the sky with the smoke and dust, family members wailed and mourned. Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s wife Lucy hugged and cried with them. Midway through the song three women stood in the audience, holding their hands together and aloft. The crowd followed suit. Young Gumatj children, oblivious to the solemnity, shrieked and played in the ceremony ground dirt. The singer\u2019s uncle, Djunga Djunga Yunupingu looked on with tears in his eyes. He had earlier urged the crowd for a moment\u2019s silence, and spoke of his nephew. \u201cHe was an Australian man and a maralitja man who sung in our language for your ears,\u201d he said. \u201cHe left us without truly knowing his place in this nation.\u201d The theme of the four-day Indigenous festival this year is Makarrata \u2013 a Yolngu word for coming together after a struggle. The overwhelming discussion is of constitutional reform, after the referendum council endorsed the Uluru statement from the heart and told government it should formally enshrine an Indigenous voice in parliament. There is a sense of both hope and fear - hope that for once Indigenous people have been listened to and fear that their request will be put in the too-hard basket. Djunga Djungu Yunupingu paid his respects to traditional owners of Australia who had gathered. \u201cWe love you and we all know how much you have suffered and the hurtful things have been done to you \u2013 but like us you are still here and will always be here.\u201d He asked Turnbull and Shorten to \u201cspeak with the tongue of fire\u201d and to find a wayawu, \u201ca pathway to a place of goodness that we cannot find\u201d. Turnbull, as he often does in a mark of respect at Indigenous events, spoke in the language and was warmly received. So too were Shorten\u2019s words \u2013 although he spoke in English \u2013 acknowledging this \u201calways was and always will be Aboriginal land\u201d. Shorten reaffirmed his desire for the prime minister to join him in constructing a referendum question by the end of the year, and to explore the creation of a Makarrata and truth telling process. Turnbull looked into the distance, listening but not reacting. The opposition leader questioned if Garma 2017 would be the one remembered as the time \u201cAustralia swapped talk for action\u201d. Turnbull made no announcement in his speech but said he was there as the nation\u2019s leader to listen. \u201cThe relationship between our nation and its First Peoples is a deeply complex one, but it\u2019s not static, it\u2019s not frozen in time. It\u2019s forever growing and changing. Our journey of reconciliation is made up of many steps \u2013 practical and symbolic,\u201d he said. He acknowledged the path had a way to go but said it would be easier to tread if all Australians were brought with them. Fire was a common theme at the formal event. Gumatj leader, Galurrwuy Yunupingu, earlier gave Turnbull and Shorten the gift of \u201csacred words of fire\u201d. \u201cYou will know that at Uluru we started a fire. A fire that we hope burns bright for Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fire is now our future and I have given the fire to you so you can talk with us with tongues of fire. Because we have come here for serious business, prime minister. Very serious business.\u201d He asked the two leaders to learn the words of fire and use them at Gulkula, which he said was \u201cthe perfect place to find a path to settlement\u201d. On the eve of the festival Shorten got ahead of the talks, proposing to the prime minister immediate and bipartisan action on a referendum question based on the recommendations of the referendum council. Turnbull has yet to give a commitment or an indication of whether his government supports the call to enshrine an Indigenous voice to parliament in the constitution. The NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, earlier in the day told Guardian Australia it was important to hear what was said at the Uluru convention and find a way to work through it. \u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re listening, and then not listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really important for Australia that we recognise the First People and recognise what they want \u2026 It\u2019s not that it\u2019s an easy task but you\u2019ve got to work through it and I think the offer of a joint committee to tackle that challenge is a good one.\u201d He said he had heard feedback about concerns that the recommendations were \u201cskipping over\u201d calls to amend the race powers. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to take the Uluru statement seriously and work on them,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes in this debate we get to concentrate on just one thing, when you can actually talk about everything.\u201d"
"16||Jesus Christ Superstar and Tero Saarinen: this week\u2019s best UK theatre and danceTheatre 1 The Flying Lovers of Vitebsk What is the cost of making art? Is it more painful to give birth to a baby or a painting? Those are some of the questions under scrutiny in this delicate two-hander based on the relationship between painter Marc Chagall and his wife Bella. Emma Rice made this show her swansong for Kneehigh and its exploration of the tensions and sacrifices of creativity is likely to be all the more poignant in light of her experiences at the Globe. Bristol Old Vic, 9-12 August; touring to 27 August 2 Jesus Christ Superstar One of the unexpected pleasures of last summer, Timothy Sheader\u2019s revival of the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical returns to Regent\u2019s Park. Tom Scutt\u2019s design, with its rusty cruciform walkway, sets the tone for an evening that may not be subtle but genuinely pulsates with emotion. There is terrific choreography from Drew McOnie and a sense that this is not just a flamboyant rock opera but also a study of celebrity, political and religious fanaticism and mob rule. So good, it almost counts as a miracle. Open Air theatre, NW1, 11 August to 23 September 3 Yerma Yes, it\u2019s sold out. But there will be a returns queue and occasional tickets are likely to be released for this remarkable reinvention of Lorca that won best revival at this year\u2019s Oliviers. Billie Piper, who also won best actress at the awards, plays a thirtysomething lifestyle journalist who is swept away by a sudden, all-consuming desire to have a child. The acting is searing; it\u2019s an evening that will leave you completely devastated. Young Vic, SE1, to 30 August 4 Fiddler on the Roof When he led Sheffield Theatres, Daniel Evans proved he had a touch with old musicals. Here, he brings Jerry Bock\u2019s 1964 contribution to the genre to vibrant life. He makes it feel pertinent, with a production that highlights the fact that the stories of the immigrants of the early 20th century are a story for our own time, too. Chichester Festival theatre, to 2 September 5 Girl from the North Country Conor McPherson\u2019s play is set in a run-down guest house in Duluth, Minnesota in 1934. Everyone has dreams, and debts too \u2013 both emotional and fiscal. McPherson has always been the great chronicler of haunted lives and that is magnified here by the exquisite use of Bob Dylan\u2019s songs. Dylan was born in Duluth seven years after the action of the play, but the way the music weaves in and out of the story reminds us how his songs are hewn from dust bowl America. Old Vic, SE1, to 7 October Dance 1 Lady Macbeth: Unsex Me Here Kally Lloyd-Jones\u2019s latest work explores Lady Macbeth, using three male performers to explore the interaction of masculine and feminine forces within Shakespeare\u2019s character. Dance Base, National Centre for Dance, Edinburgh, to 27 August 2 Tero Saarinen: Morphed The Nordic Matters festival features the excellent Saarinen with his new work, addressing ideas of masculinity and exploring choreographic extremes of tenderness and brutality. Royal Festival Hall, SE1, 10 August 3 Mariinsky Ballet The Russians\u2019 summer season ends with a revival of 19th-century classic La Bayad\u00e8re, as well as a mixed bill of one-act ballets.

"7||Championship: fans from all 24 clubs preview the 2017\u201318 seasonAston Villa A proper run at promotion is surely non-negotiable at this stage. The squad is as good and as deep as one could realistically hope for in the Championship, and Steve Bruce has now had a full pre-season and two transfer windows to bring in his own players. Given his reputation as a promotion specialist, Bruce has to deliver. Although, given what\u2019s happened in the past seven years, cautious optimism is probably the way to go as a Villa fan. One to watch: Andr\u00e9 Green. A young, pacy and direct winger who would solicit interest at just about any club but particularly so at Villa given the lack of those particular qualities in the existing squad. Jon Barnsley The hope for all Barnsley fans is a repeat of last season. Just how realistic that is depends on the coaching quality of our esteemed manager and his staff. That in itself is a double-edge sword; if Paul Heckingbottom can again confound the bookies, critics and pundits with a top-half finish, with a relatively new squad of young and hungry players brought in from the lower leagues and Scotland, it would surely attract attention from richer clubs. The dream would be to finish higher than all the other Yorkshire clubs. One to watch: With the current trend for attacking full-backs, Zeki Fryers could be an interesting prospect. It will also be good to see a fully fit Sessi D\u2019Almeida in action for the season. Having signed in August 2016 after being released by Paris Saint-Germain, he injured his cruciate knee ligament after only three games. Matthew Spencer Birmingham City We\u2019ve made a much-needed signing in defence (Marc Roberts from Barnsley), a less-needed but nevertheless good addition in goal (David Stockdale from Brighton) and a destroyer in midfield (Cheikh N\u2019Doye). Rumours suggest we\u2019re after every ageing player going \u2013 Cole, Downing, Keane \u2013 but so far nothing has materialised. It\u2019s clear Harry Redknapp is going for broke with his one-year contract and I expect us to be doing business right up until the last seconds of the window. We desperately lack pace but I don\u2019t expect this to be addressed. With Preston\u2019s Jordan Hugill on the radar, we seem keen to aim crosses into powerful forwards and rely on a sensible defence. A passionate push to the play-offs is achievable but anything else is dreamland. One to watch: Che Adams is a real talent who is still really young. I expect him to improve on a respectable first season for the club. Hopefully a run in the side will help develop him into the goalscorer we\u2019ve lacked for years. Lloyd Thomas Bolton Wanderers We have higher hopes than previous seasons but ultimately the goal is survival. We have to make sure we are still in the Championship come next summer and we can then build on that. Hopefully by then we will have a resolution to the ongoing financial problems and the transfer embargo will have been lifted, giving us a chance to compete with the teams nearer the top of the division with Premier League money. One to watch: Sammy Ameobi. He was electric down the right flank for us last season and added that bit of flair you need in the lower leagues to turn a tight game. A run of games should do his confidence the world of good and he can be a real asset in not only scoring, but providing for Adam le Fondre as well. James Davies Brentford After three seasons in the Championship, we have cemented ourselves firmly in mid-table. After selling our best players in the last few years, the club have bought intelligently and now look to climb the table. We have a young team with a lot of potential and Dean Smith has us playing exciting, attacking football. We will enter the new season with a very strong side, some fans would argue even more impressive than the 2014-15, which made it to the play-off places. If we can mount a serious challenge for a play-off position and continue our great form off the back end of last season, it will be a fantastic year. One to watch: It\u2019s between the Spaniards, Sergi Canos and Jota. The latter was withdrawn from a pre-season game against Aldershot, pending an \u201cimminent\u201d bid from a Premier league club. If we keep him, we are a very deadly side. The two of them can provide moments of magic, beat their men and look to attack at every opportunity. Though if I had to pick one, I would choose Sergi Canos. He plays for the shirt, loves the club and is a huge fan favourite. He\u2019s always looking for the quick counter, links up well with the team and has his best years ahead of him. Jordan Pettitt Bristol City Manager Lee Johnson needs a quick start or the fans\u2019 patience won\u2019t last long after an inconsistent first 18 months in charge. Realistically, avoiding another relegation battle and achieving a mid-table finish would do nicely, as a young squad and manager can hopefully then push on over the next couple of years. The club-record signing of Senegal striker Famara Di\u00e9dhiou for \u00a35.3m is promising but a play-off push is probably out of reach for now. One to watch: Local boy Bobby Reid has been in stunning form in pre-season, scoring seven goals from midfield. Has always shown flashes of real quality but never established himself in the team \u2013 at 24 this could be his year. Tom Ireland Burton Albion We\u2019re hoping to stay in the Championship \u2013 and hopefully do so a bit earlier than last season. The team played some good football last season and, with possibly two new strikers in Liam Boyce and (hopefully) Matty Fryatt, we would have two good strikers to finish off moves. One to watch: Liam Boyce and Matty Fryatt will be great additions. Jackson Irvine proved to be a great signing when he came from Ross County and hopefully Boyce will be as good. Julian Cartwright Cardiff City Stability and possibly a play-off push. Neil Warnock has settled the club down on the playing side and created a structure to build on. There is not much money around these days but he\u2019s made a few shrewd signings and, Warnock being Warnock, he has turned players who were stuck in stasis into potential gems. It\u2019s a small squad but if we can stay free of major injuries, we could be sniffing around the play-offs. One to watch: Kenneth Zohore. He barely got a kick before Warnock joined the club, but now he is unplayable at times and scored for fun in the second half of last season. If he continues where he left off last season, we could have 20-plus goals striker and star of the league on our hands. Edward Tobin Derby County Promotion. Always the aim, and after a few seasons of coming close but not quite getting there, the club seem to be taking a different approach under Gary Rowett \u2013 by building from the back with the signings of Andre Wisdom, Curtis Davies and Tom Huddlestone. Tom Ince provided a big chunk of our goals and assists so choosing the right replacement for him will be key to our promotion hopes. One to watch: Tom Huddlestone. The boy from the academy returns with a wealth of experience. His passing is a joy to behold. Adam New Fulham Fulham are an evolving unknown quantity. We always seem to be on the verge of something. Whether that something is total disaster or total greatness we don\u2019t know \u2013 either way we seem to achieve neither. We just are. Last season was a revelation. We were an absolute joy to watch, but beneath all the joy there was a smattering of uncertainty. Manager and board tensions, plus a weird Moneyball transfer policy leads us to believe that all is not well behind the scenes. While there has been the brilliant contract extensions of Tom Cairney and Ryan Sessegnon, the rest of our transfer activity has been all but non-existent. Most Fulham fans would agree that we would be in the Premier League if we had another decent option up front last season. So it comes as a great surprise that we are still without a senior striker. We will be pushing for play-offs. I also hope to keep the manager we Fulham fans all love so much. Fourth to eighth place is a realistic target but if we don\u2019t sign anyone we could meander into mid-table. Other clubs around us have really gone for it! Look at Wolves. I mean... what?! One to watch: All the talk is of Ryan Sessegnon, as it should be. The way he plays is far superior to his years. However, I am intrigued by the mercurial and somewhat enigmatic Ryan Fredericks. His pace and athleticism make him one of the most feared full-backs in the league. On his day he is unplayable. It\u2019s just his day does not come often enough. If he can kick on this year, he could have a really bright future. Joel Defries Hull City I have no idea how we\u2019ll do. Our owners are unpredictable, our manager is highly rated but new to English football. We could quite easily finish in the top two or bottom three. If forced, I\u2019d predict us to finish upper-mid-table. In the last three transfer windows we\u2019ve sold off many of our most prized assets and largely replaced them at the last minute with loanees, panic buys and free transfers. That sort of thing has a tendency to bite you on the backside eventually. One to watch: Kevin Stewart looks like a decent signing from the fringes of the Liverpool first team, but the return of Fraizer Campbell \u2013 a key player in our first ever promotion to the top flight of English football in 2008 \u2013 is highly satisfying. Youngster Jarrod Bowen could be set for a big season too. Richard Gardham Ipswich Town Following Ipswich during pre-season feels like being the kid outside the sweet-shop, face pressed to the glass. As parachute payments and rich owners (richer than ours, at least) allow others to spend money we can only dream of, our best hope is to keep hold of our top performers while picking up bargains and loans to stay competitive in a league of ever-increasing quality. While the flair of recently promoted clubs may be beyond us, if we can stay solid and other expensively assembled squads under-perform, then an assault on the play-offs is not impossible. Realistically, the prospect of ending our record of consecutive Championship seasons (16 this year) is slim, though currently League One seems a closer alternative than the Premier League. One to watch: If new loanee Bersant Celina, a tricky winger from Manchester City, has even half of the impact of Tom Lawrence, last year\u2019s season-saving loan, then he will become a fan favourite. That said, it would be refreshing to see one of our academy graduates make the grade and there are murmurings that youngster Flynn Downes could do just that after impressing in pre-season. Peter Lefort Leeds United If it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it. With the exception of Kyle Bartley (who has returned to parent club Swansea), Marco Silvestri (who has returned to his native Italy) and academy product Charlie Taylor (who has left for Premier League football under Sean Dyche), our squad from last season remains unchanged. With this foundation in place, manager Thomas Christiansen has worked with director of football Victor Orta to build for promotion. Ten signings in and more scheduled for arrival, Leeds will expect to mount a serious push for the Championship\u2019s top two. Automatic promotion, however, will be tougher than last season with Middlesbrough, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa investing in their first team. Leeds are likely to finish inside the top four \u2013 a position Christiansen would be satisfied with \u2013 however automatic promotion is by no means out of sight. One to watch: Leeds have invested substantially this summer, recruiting some serious talent. Samuel Saiz, Ezgjan Alioski, Caleb Ekuban and Felix Weidweld have joined the club from Europe but I am more excited by our existing talent. Kemar Roofe, top scorer for Oxford United two seasons ago, opened his account for Leeds last season. Played out wide under a supportive role for hitman Chris Wood, Roofe will hopefully unveil his true potential this season in what will be his second Championship campaign. Christian Cardiss Middlesbrough Promotion. It has to be. After the elation of being promoted only to make a hash of it and go straight back down, we need to go back up the first time of asking. The squad did not show their potential last season, while the former manager\u2019s overly cautious tactics did nothing to please the fans. The tactics pushed the squad over the line in the Championship but we were outclassed in the Premier League. If we can go up first time of asking by playing exciting football, that is all that any Middlesbrough fan ask for. One to watch: Britt Assombalonga, our marquee signing, can offer goals, link-up play and pace to our forward line. The squad has good technical ability but has lacked pace in certain areas. We have not had an out-and-out goalscorer in many years (excluding Patrick Bamford on loan). Ryan Dixon Millwall Mid-table would be good but survival is the more realistic aim. This is the fifth time I\u2019ve seen us promoted to this division, but this is probably the weakest of those teams. We have strengthened, but our spending power is peanuts compared to other teams at this level. Neil Harris has done a brilliant job with limited resources and I hope he\u2019s given the time and support (especially from our thrifty chairman) to build a squad good enough to compete. One to watch: We don\u2019t really have any stars but veteran Steve Morison has become what we see as a proper Millwall player; he gives 100%, is often a real nuisance for other teams and scores important goals. Mike Deegan Norwich City After the disappointment of last season, when we could only manage to finish eighth, this season sees the arrival of Daniel Farke as our first ever foreign manager. Farke has brought a few players across from Germany with him and the rebuilding job the squad needed seems to be well underway. With that in mind, it seems anything less than a top-six finish this season will be a disappointment. One to watch: Mario Vrancic. The Bosnian international midfielder joined this summer from Darmstadt and will fill the void left by Jonny Howson after his departure to Middlesbrough. Vrancic has impressed in pre-season and, if he can step up and deliver in the competitive games, he could be the man we need to push us into the play-offs. Nathan Nottingham Forest Last year I asked the football Santa for a new owner and the chance to finish the season with the same manager we started it with. Well, we got the new owner, who thus far has proved quiet and efficient, something we are not accustomed to. As for the manager, he did well with both Brentford and Rangers so the hope is that he can transfer those skills to the City Ground and bring a season of stability. No changes of manager, no relegation scares, just some decent football and a chance to see some of the young players coming through the academy before the Premier League vultures swoop in and carry them away. One to watch: Ben Brereton. A young, strong and quick striker from the academy. We barely saw Oliver Burke before he was sold. This time it would be nice to get a season out of the academy prospects. Hopefully Ben Osbourn can continue his development and I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing Karl Darlow back if Newcastle aren\u2019t interested. Lee Smith Preston North End As usual we have one of the lowest budgets in the league so it is important to remain realistic. But then Huddersfield were one of the bookies\u2019 favourites for relegation last season and went up without breaking the bank. Simon Grayson has gone but in comes Alex Neil who brought glory days back to Carrow Road albeit briefly. We have an outside shot at the play-offs. One to watch: Josh Harrop excited Manchester United fans when he scored on his debut. Big things were predicted for him yet he turned down a contract offer from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and signed for PNE. It brings back memories of David Healy when he came to Deepdale. Let\u2019s hope he can score as many. Sam McLoughlin Queens Park Rangers We\u2019re paying the price for poor, misguided and expensive signings. With no money in the pot we have to take a punt on talent from League One and League Two, our academy and a shrewd loan or two from Europe. Ian Holloway pulled off some good signings last season \u2013 including Luke Freeman from Bristol City \u2013 and saw the potential in Ryan Manning, one of our fringe players. We have to play a patient game and with nous and luck we may do a Huddersfield and get back into the Premier League in a few years. This season I\u2019d settle for lower mid-table as long as I can see a team building with integrity and playing the QPR way. One to watch: Given our precarious position it\u2019s time to appoint a new skipper who can inspire and lead from the front. Massimo Luongo has this in him and I\u2019d love to him fulfil his potential and lead the Hoops. Jools Roberts Reading Following on from last season\u2019s performance, we have to be hoping for promotion. The backroom mess has been sorted out and giving Jaap Stam a new two-year contract is our best bit of business this window. Losing Ali Al-Habsi was big as he was our player of the season for two years running. However, signing Vito Mannone for only \u00a32m is a brilliant bit of business. If we can score more than we did last season, promotion is achievable. One to watch: Liam Kelly. Watching him grow as a player is a joy. Let\u2019s hope it continues this season. Ewan Miller Sheffield United After storming to the League One title last season, hopefully we can use some of that momentum to rock the apple cart a bit. Chris Wilder seems to have an eye for a gem and has brought in a few new players, so I\u2019m hoping for a comfortable season at least. Also we\u2019re hoping to give Wednesday a good hammering. One to watch: There are quite a few. Youngster David Brooks and the returning Ched Evans will be interesting. However, I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing John Fleck in this league. He was a class above last season and I can\u2019t see him struggling at a higher level. Mike Sheffield Wednesday We\u2019ve missed out in the play-offs for the last two seasons, so the hope is the adventure of head coach Carlos Carvahal\u2019s first season can be married to the defensive pragmatism of last season\u2019s fourth place to finally deliver the promotion the fans crave. The Championship seems to get harder every year though and whether promotion is achievable in the club\u2019s 150th anniversary season remains to be seen. A derby double over our newly promoted city neighbours would also be nice. One to watch: Fernando Forestieri. His second season with the team failed to live up to the first, following various niggling injuries and the fallout over his refusal to play at Norwich last year. These issues seem to be resolved now and hopefully he can get back to the heights of his first season with us. On his day he is easily the best player in the division. Liam Foweather Sunderland We need a season of transition and consolidation after years of destabilisation. Grayson has the right attributes to mount a top-10 finish. Promotion isn\u2019t realistically on the agenda as the club seem to be trying to right the wrongs of the previous mismanagement strategy of buying overpriced mercenaries. I would take promotion but it\u2019s a big ask. One to watch: If the club can retain them and they show desire to stay and perform, Wahbi Khazri and Jeremain Lens have the ability to shine in this league. Aiden McGeady could also be a player if Grayson gets him ticking. Look out for 18-year-old Josh Maja, who has potential if given a run in the team. Stu Tench Wolverhampton Wanderers With the amount of money spent, automatic promotion should be a realistic expectation. However, this is Wolves and we are used to disappointment. The Chinese owners said they had learned from the mistakes of last year, so it\u2019s strange that they have done exactly the same as in 2016 \u2013 sacked a British manager, appointed an overseas ex-goalkeeper, signed a whole raft of new players (many of whom are clients of Jorge Mendes), broken our transfer record, neglected to sign a recognised goalscorer. What was Einstein\u2019s definition of madness? One to watch: R\u00faben Neves is \u2013 at the time of writing \u2013 the Championship\u2019s most expensive signing ever. With his silky skills and Champions League pedigree, there is anticipation but also bewilderment at the prospect of seeing him in a Wolves shirt. Why on Earth has he agreed to come to Molineux? Is this just Mendes and Fosun grandstanding? How effective, and indeed willing, is he going to be on wet nights at the less glamorous grounds in the Championship? If he lives up to his billing, he could be the man to lead us back up to where we like to believe we belong. James Allen"
"30||\u2018Grassroots means no brains': How to tackle racism in the aid sector\u201cI am so tired of dealing with \u2018grassroots\u2019 organisations here in Haiti. Unfortunately \u2018grassroots\u2019 means no brains and no money.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Ethiopians don\u2019t care about their children anyway.\u201d \u201cI know of cases where individuals have allegedly been chosen for a role because of their race, and are then expected to have the required competencies but don\u2019t.\u201d These are just some examples of racist comments we\u2019ve come across during the course of our careers. Racism is evident when a new idea is only considered legitimate when the white guy in the room offers it. It is at play when local partners\u2019 capacity is maligned. You see it when people of colour are assumed to be less qualified and have lower credentials than they do, and are passed over for jobs, promotions, or pay rises. Stories and images containing harmful stereotypes reinforce it. Racism is also at play when only 1% of humanitarian relief funds reach national or local organisations responding to earthquakes in Haiti or in Nepal, or fighting Ebola in west Africa, and when only 2% of humanitarian assistance overall goes to those organisations (pdf) on a global scale. In response we\u2019ve put together a list of four ways to challenge the structural racism that impedes global development. 1| Question the need for \u2018expats\u2019 to get the job done When aid agencies \u201carrived\u201d in the global south in the 20th century (after stripping these countries of their natural resources during colonisation), they built their work on the modernist assumption that international actors fulfilled a human resources gap, rooted in western, capitalist notions of skills and expertise. There is still an assumption by some that there\u2019s a lack of aspiring or qualified staff in developing countries ready for jobs in the aid sector. The problem is people don\u2019t see the potential that lies in existing talent pools and this has turned into structural racism in hiring practice. For example, researchers at Project Add-up found that the dual salary system within international organisations has resulted in a 400-900% wage gap between international and local staff. The Kenyan government is pushing for equity in hiring and pay within NGOs operating there, but they shouldn\u2019t have to. 2| Don\u2019t just talk about hiring, talk about leadership at all levels If there are no people of colour in strategy-making positions in an organisation, this needs fixing. Numerous studies evaluating the nonprofit sector have placed the percentages of women and people of colour in leadership roles at levels that have been unchanged for the past 10 years, even with changing demographics in both the US and the UK. A survey of the top 50 charities in the UK in 2014 by Third Sector found only 12% of chief executives, 6% of senior managers and 8% of trustees to be non-white. Another study released this year found 17% of US senior leaders in nonprofits are people of colour, greatly disproportionate to the diversity of communities they serve. Our organisations, 1847 Philanthropic and Thousand Currents, are both led by women of colour who intentionally make hiring decisions that create the world we want to see. At Thousand Currents, for example, all regional directors responsible for grant-making were born in the regions that they represent. Their knowledge, language skills and cultural competency makes a recognisable difference in the quality of partnerships. 3| Know the difference between diversity and inclusion Studies by Green 2.0 and the Center for Talent Innovation (pdf) show that diversity makes organisations smarter and more likely to have stronger results. Of course it is easy to get a head count to show a more diverse workplace. What is difficult is demonstrating to what extent people feel part of decision-making and resource allocation. Any backlash against hiring people from more diverse backgrounds is often the result of a push for diversity without inclusion. Aid agencies, foundations, NGOs and nonprofits should be able to clearly communicate their vision, rationale and metrics for changing the demographics of their workforce, as well as having transparent recruitment, hiring, and human resources processes. 4| Recognise and question how dominant white culture shows up within an organisation Creating organisations that are rooted in inclusion requires an admission that even the best diversity and inclusion strategies may fall prey to existing organisational culture. Perfectionism, a sense of urgency, quantity over quality, worship of the written word, valuing formal education over lived experience, the assumption of objectivity, conflict avoidance. Do any of these qualities sound familiar? All of these are included in what anti-racism trainers Kenneth Jones and Tema Okun describe as characteristics of white supremacy culture. In the aid sector too, we unconsciously use them as norms and standards within organisations, creating significant barriers for people from other cultures and devaluing and dismissing non-western expertise. Building truly global teams where employees and teams benefit from what inclusion has to offer will not happen overnight. But without this, the aid sector runs the risk of being like a big, misjudged Pepsi ad every day. Rashida Petersen is the CEO of 1847 Philanthropic and Jennifer Lentfer is the director of communications for Thousand Currents."

"1||Brain trauma is scary, but the NFL is as popular as ever. The people have spokenLike training camp stories on the upside of undrafted rookies, the reports of the NFL\u2019s death are greatly exaggerated. When the latest study with sobering findings on the sport\u2019s impact to its participants brains hit last week, revealing that 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players were found to have CTE, the result was the now-standard concussion news cycle punditry proclaiming that the NFL could face extinction in the not-so-distant future. That argument was only bolstered two days later when Baltimore Ravens offensive lineman (and MIT PhD candidate) John Urschel abruptly retired from football at age 26, adding to the trend of NFL players deciding to step away from the sport early in their careers. Yet while Urschel and others are choosing to walk away, fans are not. Philadelphia\u2019s open practice on Sunday \u2013 we\u2019re talking about practice \u2013 drew 23,000 people; that afternoon\u2019s Phillies-Braves game got 20,680. The very same day the Broncos drew their biggest training camp crowd in team history. And this is the support for two teams that didn\u2019t even make the playoffs last year. For all the talk last season about the NFL\u2019s declining TV numbers, they ended up being only a small percentage off of all-time highs. The numbers actually trended up as the season went on, aided by Tom Brady\u2019s return from suspension, overall league play improving from an ugly start and the distraction of the presidential election ending mid-season, culminating in more than 117m people watching the Patriots and Falcons in the Super Bowl. The American public is choosing to keep football as the nation\u2019s No1 sport and it\u2019s not because the average person simply doesn\u2019t know about CTE yet. Dr Bennet Omalu first found the condition in the brains of deceased players in 2005. That was 12 years ago. Will Smith\u2019s Concussion movie came out two years ago. You\u2019re almost as likely to hear about CTE on SportsCenter as you are about TEs and TDs. Yet 117 million still watched the Super Bowl and 23,000 chose to spend their afternoon seeing the 7-9 Eagles play two-hand touch. It seems most fans have decided that if the players know the health risks and are choosing to take the field, then they\u2019re fine with cheering them on. If modern society is still okay with the likes of Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor wailing away on each other\u2019s skulls for 12 rounds (or one round, depending on your opinion of McGregor\u2019s chances), then a sport in which every hit is not a head shot can\u2019t be on the way out anytime soon. And those who feel America\u2019s sense of compassion will lead to the demise of football? They must not have spent much time observing America of late. If there\u2019s a debate in the country about whether the poor should have access to health care, how many Americans have genuine concern about the long-term health of football players being paid millions? Probably not enough to make a noticeable dent in ratings. If people don\u2019t want their tax money to help cover the medical costs of others, they sure aren\u2019t going to give up their beloved Sunday entertainment because some people who make 50 times their income might be getting hurt. CTE is a concern for the NFL, however, even if for just purely capitalist reasons. Participation in the sport by six to 12 year-old boys has dropped 20% since 2009, proving many parents are happy to watch people play football as long as the people playing it aren\u2019t their own flesh and blood. But if fewer people are playing the sport, and more who are playing choose to retire early, the league will have a growing issue over quality of play. The league-wide trend to replace experienced veterans with younger, cheaper players has already impacted the product on the field, especially early in the season when younger players are still getting up to speed. Ratings will respond negatively to bad football, as they did early last season. The NFL needs bodies, as awful \u2013 yet no less true \u2013 as that sounds in the context of a discussion of CTE. To keep the number of youth players from dipping further, the NFL will keep endorsing safety initiatives like Heads Up Football and tweaking rules on things like helmet-to-helmet contact and kick returns. All of it has very limited impact on the actual safety of the sport \u2013 tackle football is inherently violent and the promised violence is why many people watch \u2013 but those types of changes around the edges have PR benefit. But the biggest change that we could see soon in football is one that could very much benefit players. Not their brains, though. Their bank accounts. Giants superstar receiver Odell Beckham said last week that he would like to see NFL players earn the same as their NBA counterparts. \u201cYou watch people in the NBA, and it\u2019s crazy what they get. There are people in the NFL who deserve that,\u201d he said to Uninterrupted. \u201cI just want to be at the forefront, help push the league, the game that way, because I feel like the players deserve it.\u201d Ignoring the impossible economics of Beckham\u2019s statements \u2013 NFL teams with 53 players on a roster will never pay the same as NBA teams that have just 15 on payroll \u2013 NFL team owners may soon find it in their best interests to pay players much more money than they\u2019re making today. Maybe even guaranteed money finally. Urschel, a backup lineman, made $600,000 last year. Would the league be able to prevent others like him from retiring early if they were making $2m a year? Would a player of Calvin Johnson\u2019s status step away from the game if he was pulling in $20m a season instead of $12m? The owners might just figure that paying out a little more in the next CBA will allow them to keep their sport supplied with high-level athletes so they can continue raking in massive profits far into the future. It\u2019s a cynical approach to dealing with a serious problem, sure, but that means it\u2019s almost guaranteed to be what Roger Goodell\u2019s NFL does."
"15||NHS to assess three hospitals to determine care for suicidal girlNHS officials are to spend the day assessing whether three hospitals can provide proper care for a girl who is believed to be at serious risk of taking her own life when she is released from youth custody in 10 days\u2019 time, and for whom no bed could be found.

The girl, for legal reasons named only as X, has made a series of \u201cdetermined attempts\u201d on her own life while in custody, and her carers had said they expected to hear she had made another immediately after her release. With no secure bed available, she was due to be released to the community in 10 days. On Thursday night, NHS England said it had identified beds in three hospitals and those were scheduled to be assessed on Friday to determine whether any could provide her with the right care and support. They declined to say how many individual places had been identified. On Thursday evening, Dr Mike Prentice, the medical director for the NHS north region, said: \u201cThe judge is quite right that the relevant agencies need to ensure a safe, new care placement for this young woman which is suitable given the great complexities of her situation. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s now happening, and a number of options have now been identified, with detailed clinical and social assessments taking place tomorrow to ensure the right package of care can be put in place before her release date.\u201d Munby said X needed a place in a low secure bed; in his judgment she had been assessed as not qualifying for a place in a medium-secure unit because she was judged as primarily being a danger to herself rather than to others. There are 124 low secure beds in England but the judge had been told that a place could be found for X for six months. Her situation became more complex during her time in youth custody, though officials declined to say whether or not she had been reclassified as needing a place in the more secure facility. Munby, the president of the family division of the high court, issued a stinging attack on the \u201cdisgraceful and utterly shaming lack of proper provision in this country of the clinical, residential and other support services\u201d. The case was a \u201csevere wakeup call\u201d and not isolated, the former children\u2019s minister Tim Loughton said. He told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme: \u201cI\u2019m afraid what he said today is nothing new, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s just one aspect of the shortcomings of mental health services in this country at the moment, and particularly for children and young people. \u201cThis is quite a severe wakeup call and we\u2019ve got to do a lot, lot better for kids in our country who are suffering these sorts of mental illnesses. \u201cThis is a high-profile problem today but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s something that happens all too often. There is a shortage of beds generally, certainly at the severe end. There is certainly a shortage of beds for those people who need help because they are a harm to themselves, potentially.\u201d Sarah Brennan, the chief executive of the charity YoungMinds, said X\u2019s case should never have got to this point. \u201cIt is shocking that, in 2017, we cannot find the appropriate care for a young person in such desperate need, even when there is a recognised duty of care. Coming out of the youth justice system makes it even more complex and they must also accept responsibility for her care.\u201d She said the government had begun to focus on the right areas, but said \u201cchange takes time and this case shows how far there still is to go\u201d. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

"26||So Happy It Hurts by Anneliese Mackintosh review \u2013 an epistolary novelOttila McGregor has a new year resolution. She\u2019s going to make herself happy \u2013 \u201cso happy it hurts,\u201d she tells her therapist, \u201cSO FUCKING HAPPY IT REALLY FUCKING KILLS,\u201d she writes to herself. At the moment, she\u2019s just hurting herself, via a destructive relationship (an affair with her boss) and too much drink. That\u2019s not too much drink in a Bridget Jones, fake-horrified, unit-totting sort of way. It\u2019s too much drink in a sexting-your-manager-again, tweeting-that-you-want-to-die, having-your-stomach-pumped way. So Ottila is going to \u201cturn everything around\u201d, confiding the process to the \u201cgrief scrapbook\u201d she\u2019s assembling inside a vandalised copy of The Little Book of Happy. Ottila knows about grief scrapbooks: she works in a support centre for people with cancer and their families. What is she grieving for? Booze, of course \u2013 and other things, the things her drinking tried to chase away. The Little Book of Happy doesn\u2019t actually exist, but I assumed it was real until I checked: one of those small, square hardbacks where inspiring quotations nestle against platitudinous advice. So Happy It Hurts, on the other hand, is a pleasingly unfamiliar kind of book. Anneliese Mackintosh\u2019s debut novel (a follow-up to the scabrous short-story sequence Any Other Mouth, many of the themes of which are revisited here) is told through Ottila\u2019s diary entries, transcripts of therapy sessions, emails, Snapchats and receipts. It\u2019s an epistolary novel for a hyperconnected world, and the effect is appropriately chaotic \u2013 the reader feels at first a little like a drunk turning out her pockets and trying to reconstruct another night of blackout from the detritus she\u2019s accumulated. Ottila belongs to the great sisterhood of the Female Fuck-Up. Not the eroticised trainwrecks male writers love to invent, but the real-deal ones like Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag, the ones whose wisecracks come with the authentic acid burn of a wretched hangover and human faults. Ottila is selfish, and she knows it. The bad sex she has is not a pornographic excess of humiliation filtered through the male gaze for the reader\u2019s grubby enjoyment but, seen from her perspective, clammy and unsatisfying and barely remembered. She has bad judgment, which means that when she decides to distract herself from drinking by developing a new crush, you worry for her. This crush, on a vulnerable man-bear called Thales who works in the canteen, forms the backbone of the plot, their burgeoning relationship waylaid by Austenish imbroglios of manners (although Ottila\u2019s faux pas involve more binge drinking and bad sex than the average Austen heroine). But, also Austenishly, the love story is something of a McGuffin. As much as you\u2019re rooting for Ottila to get her man, that\u2019s not the point; the point is whether she can gain the moral wisdom to live a better kind of life. She\u2019s an Emma steeped in ethanol. Ottila\u2019s fragile sobriety demands that she finally attend to the things she\u2019s spent years obliterating. That means addressing her grief at her father\u2019s death, and her guilt at her relationship with her sister Mina, who has Asperger\u2019s syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety and a tendency to self-harm. \u201cThere\u2019s an alternate reality out there somewhere, in which I didn\u2019t bully her growing up \u2026 But then what are big sisters for?\u201d writes Ottila, full of bitter self-reproach at three months dry. Mina is given electroconvulsive therapy, which wrecks her short-term memory, leading to a plaintive Snapchat where Mina asks Ottila to move to a more permanent form of messaging: the way Snapchats ping out of existence makes poor Mina feel even more unstable. The media Mackintosh chooses for her story are always smartly entwined with character and plot. At one point, Ottila\u2019s scrapbook includes a funding application to Manchester Museum for a project called \u201cOur Love Began With a Coin Touched by Alexander the Great\u201d, commemorating the first time Thales said \u201cI love you\u201d. In it, items of significance to the nascent couple would be scattered through the museum so visitors could vicariously share their feelings: an empty takeaway cup from their first coffee together, a sandwich box used to sneak a note through the hospital. It is, of course, rejected; but the idea that life must be curated, with both good and bad exhibited and reinterpreted, is at the centre of this raw, funny and untidily generous novel. \u2022 So Happy It Hurts is published by Jonathan Cape.

"0||The Big Sick and Valerian: this week\u2019s best films in the UK1 The Big Sick (15) (Michael Showalter, 2017, US) 120 mins The standout romcom of the year so far, even if it stretches the definition somewhat, seeing as one half of the couple (Zoe Kazan) spends most of the movie in a coma. That leads her Pakistani-American non-boyfriend Kumail Nanjiani into some awkward, cross-cultural meet-the-parents territory. Based on Nanjiani\u2019s real-life experience, it\u2019s a heartfelt, bittersweet tale. 2 Dunkirk (12A) (Christopher Nolan, 2017, Neth/UK/Fra/US) 106 mins Nolan reinvents the war movie with a gripping, immersive account of the Dunkirk evacuations, told almost entirely through action, rather than words. Three perspectives \u2013 the beach, the sea and the air \u2013 are cleverly woven together with the help of a host of familiar faces (Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, etc) and a pounding score. 3 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (12A) (Luc Besson, 2017, Fra) 137 mins Besson\u2019s sci-fi epic has already been labelled a flop, but it\u2019s more interesting and imaginative, and less predictable, than many a blockbuster \u201chit\u201d. Admittedly, Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne are underwhelming leads, but this is a universe crammed with exotic creatures, exuberant costumes and agreeably random cameos. 4 Land of Mine (15) (Martin Zandvliet, 2015, Den/Ger) 99 mins Taking a very different tack from Dunkirk, this tough and tense wartime story plays out on a small scale. The setting is the Danish coast in the aftermath of the second world war, where a bitter army sergeant cajoles young German prisoners of war into removing the thousands of land mines left by their forces. 5 The Ghoul (15) (Gareth Tunley, 2016, UK) 83 mins This low-budget thriller cleverly cuts loose the psychological moorings, casting us adrift in the world of a detective (Tom Meeten) who\u2019s masquerading as a delusional loner, or is it the other way round? Occult mysticism and Lynchian narrative loops add to the appeal."
"26||\u2018It\u2019s not romantic at all\u2019 \u2013 Merchant Ivory\u2019s Howards End 25 years onIt was the poster that got me: Samuel West kissing Helena Bonham Carter. She looks cross, he looks tormented, and behind them is a dream of a house, wreathed in roses and wisteria. Going to see Howards End at the cinema in 1992, I knew the house gave the film its name, just like I knew there was definitely no apostrophe. I was a Merchant Ivory addict. My gateway drug had been A Room with a View, and all I wanted was to be kissed among violets, to play the piano wildly, messily and boldly, and to live the same way. I was 17. I was doing my Grade 5 piano and I\u2019d had my first kiss, next to a hedge at the end of my road, trying to make my hair billow madly like Bonham Carter\u2019s throughout. I wanted Howards End to be all pretty lawns and picture hats. I didn\u2019t care that Merchant Ivory were derided as \u201cthe Laura Ashley school of film-making\u201d. In fact, it made me like them more. I didn\u2019t want politics that seemed, back then, a jumble of John Major eating peas on Spitting Image, the Queen having her annus horribilis, and no bins at tube stations because of the IRA. My first disappointment was the lack of Italy. Howards End was all rain and no violets. But there were bluebells, a whole wood of them, lit up by the dawn, blue in every direction, and West\u2019s autodidact clerk, Leonard Bast, striding through them after leaving his office and walking \u201cright out of London\u201d, all through the night. Like the Schlegel sisters (Bonham Carter\u2019s Helen and Emma Thompson\u2019s Margaret), I was captivated by the romance of Leonard\u2019s adventure. I wanted him, and I wanted to be Helen/Helena: impetuous, passionate, rule-breaking; a rackety, bohemian bluestocking in fabulous frocks, all cinched-in waists, high collars, trailing skirts and acres of lace. I believed that if I, too, found myself out rowing with an intriguing young man, and the rowing turned into snogging, we would just put down our oars and conveniently drift into some bulrushes for a private tryst. But Leonard and Helen don\u2019t end up together. Instead, he ends up dead, crushed (with horrible irony) by a bookcase. From Howards End, I learned to love bluebells, and to fear bookcases. But not just that. Watching the film again, restored gorgeously for its 25th anniversary, I remember how it woke me up to more. Much more. The plot turns on who will live in Howards End: the progressive Schlegels or the ruthless, venal Wilcox family, headed by Henry, who thinks he is being unsentimental (rather than uncaring) when he says: \u201cThe poor are poor. One is sorry for them but there it is.\u201d It\u2019s not just about the house but about this country, which EM Forster, writing in 1910, hoped would end up more Schlegel than Wilcox. It seems a huge defeat when Margaret marries Henry and becomes a Wilcox herself. I worried, returning to the film, that I\u2019d find Helen, who wants to help poverty-stricken Leonard and his wife, a bit do-goody. I worried I\u2019d feel more for Margaret, and maybe understand why she marries horrid Henry. I don\u2019t. I still want to be Helen, burning with righteous fury at injustice, pursuing men and subversively snapping back, when Margaret asks why she is so bitter, \u201cBecause I\u2019m an old maid.\u201d As for Margaret, it\u2019s all very well to be clever and arch, but what does she see in such a philistine and bully as Henry? Why does she stick with him after she finds out he seduced Leonard\u2019s wife Jacky, when she was only 16? Does she want to save him? It\u2019s striking that the phrase the book is most famous for \u2013 \u201conly connect\u201d \u2013 never appears in the film. Forster put it in a passage about Henry and Margaret\u2019s first kiss. It is not a good one. Margaret is \u201cdispleased\u201d, but then she decides to help Henry build \u201cthe rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion\u201d. Exhorting him to \u201cOnly connect!\u201d she hopes he\u2019ll \u201clive in fragments no longer\u201d \u2013 and be a better kisser. Her later attempts to get him to help the Basts are part of the same scheme, to make him connect with people different from himself. But he won\u2019t. He is too obtuse. What I learned, watching Howards End at 17, was that for all their good intentions, the Schlegels do as much damage as the Wilcoxes. Because of them, Leonard ends up dead, and Jacky loses him even before that, when he betrays her by sleeping with Helen. It\u2019s a shock to watch this again now. It\u2019s not romantic at all. What\u2019s more, for all the hats and lawns and lace, Howards End feels more urgent than ever in austerity Britain, and watching it sparked the uneasy fear that the Wilcoxes are winning. It\u2019s an early 90s film as well as an Edwardian story \u2013 and not just because with hindsight it\u2019s clear Bonham Carter\u2019s massive hair is not period at all, but pure 80s. So should we connect or should we not? The film doesn\u2019t tell us, just as Forster didn\u2019t, because he didn\u2019t know. He was honest about the fact that we can\u2019t smugly believe we are Schlegels and hate the Wilcoxes, as I did back then. Because Helen is just as selfish as Henry. She shouldn\u2019t steal another woman\u2019s man, no matter how beautiful the river is, how tempting the bulrushes, no matter how much she wants to comfort him for the way things have \u201cgot spoiled\u201d. She shouldn\u2019t be out in a boat with him at all. And maybe Forster\u2019s message, conveyed with such nuance and intelligence in this film, is that we all have to question ourselves a bit more, to worry usefully about how we connect, and not to pretend to have the answers. \u2022 Samantha Ellis is the author of How to Be a Heroine and Take Courage: Anne Bront\u00eb and the Art of Life (Vintage).

"6||Without Irish unification, a hard Brexit is impossible \r\nIs Northern Ireland the poison pill of hard Brexit? The visit of the new Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, to Belfast today is remarkable. This is not just for the astonishing sight of a southern politician who believes passionately in gay rights visiting the still conservative north \u2013 given how long the south\u2019s reactionary Catholicism has been butt of northern ridicule. The visit is also part of Varadkar\u2019s campaign to exploit Brexit as a tool of unification. The north-south border is one of the three \u201cstarter\u201d issues of British EU withdrawal, to be resolved before a post-Brexit deal can be discussed. Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionists hold two contradictory positions: that hard Brexit is good; and that the border with the south must remain \u201cporous\u201d, for goods and people. They want tighter control on immigration into the UK, but know perfectly well that the border with the south cannot be closed. It is another case of wanting Brexit \u2013 \u201cbut not for me\u201d. Various versions of squaring this circle have been mooted, none satisfactory. A possible deal might involve tagging lorries heading north or south, requiring awesome bureaucracy and enforcement. People movement is harder. The prospect of Northern Ireland as a Balkan underbelly of EU movement into Britain may be exaggerated, but it is real. Northern Ireland could remain de facto within the EU visa area, but with a formal passport border set up between Belfast and Britain. Dublin would love that, and Belfast hate it. Or Dublin could somehow become part of an all-UK passport zone, vetting travellers from the EU suspected of wanting to travel north. That would look like Ireland going semi-detached from the EU. Or nothing could happen, and the old cross-border rackets could resume. Having no border with the south would mean that EU migrants could continue flocking to Britain, albeit by a circuitous route. The British negotiators would not accept this. To Irish republicans, Brexit is a golden opportunity for pushing unification of an island that has, like Cyprus, been a tragic casualty of identity politics for almost a century. An open border post-Brexit and a gradual merging of the subsidy-dependent north with the free-booting south makes every kind of sense. If Britain wants to \u201cgo it alone\u201d, let the island of Ireland have no part in it. Let Europe\u2019s border be the Irish Sea. Let Ireland unite. If that prospect is too much for northern unionists to stomach, they had better get working. Hard Brexit is not just bad for the UK; in their case it is unworkable. Additional border controls around Northern Ireland \u2013 wherever drawn \u2013 would further isolate the province\u2019s struggling economy. The DUP should fight for a single market and an open border. For once, it is in a parliamentary position to make a British government listen to it. But time is short. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"
"9||Trump blasts Russia investigation as Mueller convenes grand juryDonald Trump has sought to rally thousands of diehard supporters against the investigation into his campaign\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia \u2013 on the same day news emerged that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has convened a grand jury in the case. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story,\u201d Trump told a rally in Huntington, West Virginia. The concerted effort could be a sign that the White House is realising the full gravity of the situation. Mueller, appointed special counsel in May following the dismissal of the former FBI director James Comey, has recruited more than a dozen investigators, including current and former justice department prosecutors with experience in international bribery, organised crime and financial fraud. On Thursday, it was reported \u2013 first by the Wall Street Journal, but later by other outlets including the Associated Press \u2013 that Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington, meaning he could subpoena witnesses and records in the coming weeks and months. The use of a grand jury, a standard prosecution tool in criminal investigations, suggests that Mueller and his team of investigators are likely to hear from witnesses and demand documents in the coming weeks and months. In what might be seen as a bid to weaponise his populist base, Trump told the crowd in Huntington, a coal country stronghold where he beat Hillary Clinton by 42 percentage points: \u201cMost people know there were no Russians in our campaign; there never were. We didn\u2019t win because of Russia. We won because of you.\u201d The crowd, many with \u201cMake America great again\u201d hats or signs, erupted in vociferous cheers. Trump continued: \u201cWe won because we totally outworked the other side. We won because of millions of patriotic Americans voted to take back their country.\u201d The president asked mockingly: \u201cHave you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania? Are there any Russians here tonight, any Russians? They can\u2019t beat us at the voting booths so they\u2019re trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want. They\u2019re trying to cheat you out of the leadership that you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us and most importantly demeaning to our country and demeaning to our constitution.\u201d Trump\u2019s rhetoric at a 9,000-person capacity arena on Thursday echoed rallies during the election campaign where he claimed the system was rigged against him. This time he appeared to be scattering seeds of doubt about the investigations by Mueller and two congressional committees into whether there was collusion between Russia and Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cI just hope the final determination is a truly honest one, which is what the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve and what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve,\u201d the president added ominously. \u201cDemocrat lawmakers will have to decide. They can continue their obsession with the Russian hoax or they can serve the interests of the American people. Try winning at the voter booth. Not going to be easy, but that\u2019s the way you\u2019re supposed to do it.\u201d Trump spared the media his usual broadsides and instead focused on the Democrats, whom he claimed were trying to find an excuse for \u201cthe greatest loss in the history of American politics\u201d. Prosecutors should be looking for former secretary of state Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33,000 emails, he added, prompting thunderous cheers and chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d \u2013 some nine months after the election. The prolonged denial of links to Moscow signalled a shift in strategy for Trump, who rarely dwells on the issue during rallies, where few supporters seem concerned. His daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, also brought it up during a short speech, calling it a \u201ccrazy story about Russia\u201d. And the West Virginia governor Jim Justice, announcing his defection from the Democrats to the Republicans, told the crowd: \u201cHave we not heard enough about the Russians? I mean, to our God in heaven, think about it: the stock market\u2019s at 22,000 and this country has hope and we\u2019re on our way.\u201d The defense attorney John Dowd told the Associated Press: \u201cWith respect to the news of the federal grand jury, I have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation.\u201d Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he was not aware Mueller had started using a new grand jury. \u201cGrand jury matters are typically secret,\u201d Cobb told the Associated Press. \u201cThe White House favours anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly \u2026 The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr Mueller.\u201d It was unclear how the Washington grand jury was connected to the work of a separate grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, that has been used to gather information on Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is under scrutiny over his ties to Moscow. Steve Williams, the mayor of Huntington, criticised Trump\u2019s claim that the Russia story was a hoax. \u201cIt obviously isn\u2019t because Mueller is announcing today that a grand jury has been impaneled. Methinks he does protest too much.\u201d Trump\u2019s speech in the city was a wasted opportunity, Williams added. \u201cI thought it was a 2016 campaign rally. I expected some discussion about the opioid crisis, particularly since the president\u2019s commission\u2019s report came out a couple of days ago. I was hoping he would declare a national emergency.\u201d"
"31||Match day with the world\u2019s only gay cricket club \u2013 photo essayAsad comes click-clacking up the narrow wooden staircase in his spikes and pulls on a helmet that turns out not to be his \u2013 he can\u2019t get the chin strap done up. \u201cDo I really need a helmet out there?\u201d he asks, nodding towards the field, framed by the dormer window in a hot and airless changing room. Team-mate Stuart\u2019s response is immediate and firm: \u201cDefinitely.\u201d Stuart has already faced Merton\u2019s pace attack and been bowled for five; by the time we get back downstairs for drinks, opening batsman Manish is proudly showing off a growing welt on his chin (he shunned the helmet) and a bloodied elbow. This is Sunday afternoon cricket in south-west London: there are cheese-and-pickle sandwiches, quiches, and flasks of coffee. The smell of barbecues hangs in the air. At the long-off boundary a family flies a kite, its bright colours a match for the rainbow emblem on the shirts and caps of Grace\u2019s Cricket Club, my hosts for the day and, as far as they know, the world\u2019s first and only gay cricket club. It was formed in 1996 when a group of cricket fans began to gather at Central Station, a gay bar in Kings Cross, which continues to host the committee as well as club socials. These days the team calls on players from across the capital, and today\u2019s balmy weather boosts supporter numbers too \u2013 Augusto skipped a rainy match last weekend but is here in the sunshine, paperback in hand. \u201cWhat more can you want?\u201d Stuart asks, squinting into the sun from the shade of the pavilion. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got beautiful weather, just to get out there and hit the ball, and enjoy being with each other and having a good time.\u201d Not that Grace\u2019s do not go in for competition. Although they currently arrange each outdoor season as a series of friendlies, they pride themselves on their record (a defeat at the end of May the one blot on their card so far this year) and have their sights set on a return to league action now that the playing squad is big enough to field two teams. \u201cWe all really do enjoy our cricket,\u201d Stuart grins. Throughout the day there are updates from the ICC Champions Trophy meeting between India and South Africa, and conversations about Sri Lanka\u2019s remarkable win over India earlier in the week. When Matthew, the club\u2019s oldest member and its chairman (\u201cI think they thought that\u2019s all I was good for,\u201d he says with a wink) trudges back to the changing room, he\u2019s not happy. \u201cYou got out, did you?\u201d Stuart asks gently. \u201cWell,\u201d Matthew says, \u201cthe umpire said I was out.\u201d Despite Merton\u2019s impressive attack, Grace\u2019s post a respectable 218 off 40 overs. \u201cOur tail is wagging!\u201d Stuart shouts gleefully, slotting numbers into the scoreboard as the lower order batsmen poach singles with some fine running. They restrict the opposition to 143 when play resumes after tea. The club\u2019s competitive spirit is impressive. \u201cWe have stats every year,\u201d says Stuart. \u201cLater in the season people are quite keenly looking at how they\u2019re doing and what they need to do to get ahead.\u201d When Stuart\u2019s father joined them as an umpire on a tour to Malta in 2016, Stuart suspects he arrived with low expectations. Instead he was sufficiently impressed to invite Grace\u2019s to play on his patch in the East Midlands. The overseas trip proved to be a bonding experience on and off the field, and the team flourished in the season that followed; this spring they travelled to La Manga and faced Spanish internationals. Fundamental to the club is its place as a safe space for cricket fans and players who might otherwise feel excluded from the sport. The squad is international \u2013 with players from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the UK \u2013 and there are various reasons why being open about their sexuality in other parts of their lives and with other groups of people might not be possible. Manish recalls appearing in a television interview about the club five or six years ago and fretting that it could be broadcast in India, where his father might see it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t out then,\u201d he says, standing next to his partner Anthony, who is doling out snacks from a cool box. Encouraged by Manish\u2019s impish grin, I ask if things are different now. \u201cYeah, I told him,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s been really supportive.\u201d Not everyone can say the same, though, and that is why a club that continues to fly the flag, literally and metaphorically, remains as important now as it was in the mid-1990s. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to walk into a club of like-minded people,\u201d says Stuart, who has been a member for five years and is now vice-captain. \u201cThere\u2019s no strain about what might be someone else\u2019s reaction. We\u2019re very sensitive about each other\u2019s outness (or not). This is a place where you\u2019re safe and no one\u2019s going to be outing you in public.\u201d For a significant portion of members cricket only exists in their lives through this club. Support and acceptance from opposing teams is also important; most teams in this neck of the woods know of the club, and have never shown any reluctance to play, or been unfriendly. The teams split the cost of tea \u2013 here in Merton it\u2019s an excellent spread, with rows of mugs of hot tea waiting alongside sandwiches, nibbles, and cakes \u2013 and always chat over drinks at the end of the day. \u201cSometimes, when the matter of sexuality comes up, there\u2019s actually a great deal of curiosity,\u201d Stuart says. \u201cIt\u2019s all really good-natured; it helps educate everybody.\u201d The squad has grown by five or six players over the past 18 months, the newest recruit being Australian Neil \u2013 he is straight but, after finding Grace\u2019s online, was encouraged to join the club by his fianc\u00e9e. We chat about the ongoing political wrangling over marriage equality in his home nation, which contributed to his decision to join Grace\u2019s. \u201cThese guys just want to play cricket,\u201d he says, before strolling out to bat at No 3. His poise at the crease and wonderful timing \u2013 Neil used to play \u201csemi-seriously\u201d in his teens \u2013 is as welcome as his attitude. Where the club is still looking to grow is in welcoming a broader spectrum of players: Grace\u2019s is an LGBT organisation, but \u201cwe\u2019re a bit heavy on the Gs\u201d, says Stuart. There are no female members, for instance, but the committee has talked about a recruitment campaign later this year. \u201cWe come in all shapes and sizes,\u201d Stuart says. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have a place where you can just be yourself, and grow into whoever you need to be.\u201d NatWest has supported cricket, the game for all, since 1981.

"19||Pearson to axe 3,000 jobs after slump at main US businessPearson is to cut 3,000 jobs as the embattled company looks to slash costs after a slump at its US higher education business. The world\u2019s largest education company, which has issued five profit warnings in the past four years, intends to axe about 10% of its 32,000 global workforce by the end of 2019. The latest round of cuts means that the chief executive, John Fallon, will have shed 10,000 staff, about 25% of Pearson\u2019s global workforce, since he took over from Dame Marjorie Scardino in 2013. \u201cNo one takes pleasure in this sort of transformation we have to do but it is fundamental to the long-term future of the company,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cI am looking forward to getting the revenue growth of the company going again.\u201d The cuts, which will save the firm about \u00a3300m annually, will come from across the company with a major focus on its struggling US business, where its higher education unit is struggling with a decline in textbook sales and the transition towards digital learning. \u201cIn North America we need to adjust the cost base to the reality of a smaller higher education courseware business,\u201d said Coram Williams, Pearson\u2019s finance chief. Jobs are expected to go in areas including IT, finance and human resources as well as company management, as the business looks to become leaner and more digitally focused. Fallon recently attended a company sales event at its US business, which accounts for two-thirds of Pearson\u2019s revenues and profits, and he said that the \u201cmood and morale was very strong, buoyant\u201d. \u201cPeople are confident about the year ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand the challenges in the business over the next two or three years but are also excited by the opportunity. There is plenty of time to plan and prepare.\u201d Since Fallon took the top role in 2013 through to 2020 the company\u2019s cost base will have been reduced by \u00a3950m, including three tranches of job cuts: 3,000 in 2013-14; 4,000 in 2016; and the latest round by the end of 2019. Pearson, which conducts most of its business in the second half of the year, reported first-half revenues up 1% to \u00a32.05bn and reiterated that it would hit its revised targets for 2017. The North American business managed flat growth, with revenue of \u00a31.28bn, better than forecasts. Pearson has factored in a 6% decline at its US higher education business this year and in 2018 before it is expected to recover. It hopes to benefit from a stabilisation in the drop in school enrolments and its digital strategy \u2013 such as increasing focus on cutting e-book prices and textbook rentals \u2013 starting to pay off. The company announced it has added book chain Barnes &amp; Noble to its textbook rental scheme. In February, Pearson reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a32.6bn for 2016, the biggest in its history. In May, Fallon, who has faced calls to step down, encountered a massive shareholder revolt with almost 70% voting against, or failing to support by abstention, his \u00a31.5m pay package. In January, the company slashed its profit forecast for this year by \u00a3180m and scrapped its target of \u00a3800m for next year."
"7||Football transfer rumours: Arsenal's Alexis S\u00e1nchez to Monaco for \u00a345m?Are you still interested in transfer stuff? Quite a big one happened yesterday, so we\u2019d understand if you couldn\u2019t be bothered. But the demand for this sort of guff seems insatiable, so maybe you do want more. If so, read on. So Barcelona need a new willowy, skilful forward, ideally one that plays from the left of a three-man attack and is good enough to replace that chap with the hair that split town on Thursday. Well, according to the Daily Star, the man they have in mind is Eden Hazard, who has told Bar\u00e7a that he\u2019d be delighted to move there, issuing a SNUB to Real Madrid in the process. Meanwhile, Diego Costa is supposedly calling in the lawyers in order to force through a move to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, which seems a bit much. Chelsea will console themselves after these two blows by trying to gazump Liverpool for Virgil van Dijk. With one saga over, another begins. According to our pals in Spain, Zinedine Zidane reckons that Real Madrid will have to sell Gareth Bale if they want to sign Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. That\u2019s not necessarily to raise the dough, although that\u2019s clearly a factor, but more that Zidane doesn\u2019t think the young colt can fit with Bale, Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, so one of them has to go. Obviously, Manchester United\u2019s collective ears have pricked up at that talk, and are supposedly prepping a \u00a390m bid for Gaz. In other saga news, there\u2019s chat doing the rounds that Monaco are the latest club in for Alexis S\u00e1nchez. They\u2019ll offer \u00a345m for the Arsenal forward, it says here, the cheeky little rascals. Everton are back in for Olivier Giroud as well, which we suspect will be rather less of a crushing blow. Across town, Tottenham are sending last season\u2019s deadline day mistake Moussa Sissoko on loan to Trabzonspor in order to make way for whatever error they\u2019re going to make this time, while they\u2019re also sniffing around Giovanni \u2018Son of Diego\u2019 Simeone, currently a forward at Genoa. Other stuff: Frank de Boer wants Manchester United kid Tim Fosu-Mensah; Bournemouth have had a \u00a320m bid for Demarai Gray rejected; Watford want Alberto Moreno and Aaron Lennon; West Ham and Besiktas have been on the phone to Sunderland because they want Lamine Kon\u00e9 and Jeremain Lens respectively; and in \u2018What Could Possibly Go Wrong?\u2019 news, Sunderland are also supposedly keen on Ross McCormack."
"21||Henri Matisse and Stephen Sutcliffe: this week\u2019s best UK exhibitions1 Matisse in the Studio The art collection that Matisse built over a lifetime, from Kongo masks to north African furniture, has a starring role in his paintings and this exhibition. Born in 1869, Matisse lived more than a third of his life in the 19th century and was schooled in its conventions. In the 1900s, he played a leading part in turning those conventions upside down. Together with friends such as Pablo Picasso, he found inspiration in what was then called \u201cprimitive\u201d art. In later years, travel helped him renew his own art, and his collection reflects that. A glimpse of genius at work. Royal Academy of Arts, W1, 5 August to 12 November 2 Stephen Sutcliffe Class and sexuality are the themes of an exhibition that revisits the 1960s. David Storey\u2019s 1963 novels Radcliffe and This Sporting Life (particularly the relationship between Lindsay Anderson, who directed the film adaptation, and its star Richard Harris), are chewed over in two video installations. The Glasgow-based artist\u2019s working methods are also explored, along with the development of his videos and film collages. Talbot Rice Gallery, Edinburgh, to 30 August 3 Bobby Niven This environmental artist and sculptor is best known as one of the leaders of the Bothy Project, a utopian scheme to provide artist-designed shelters in landscapes all over Scotland and further afield. Here he creates a temporary sculpture workshop with hand-carved elements. Craft and conversation will be available in an airing of ideas about art, society and nature. Johnston Terrace Wildlife Garden, Edinburgh, to 27 August 4 Beyond Caravaggio You cannot get more powerful drama than the stark and sexy art of Caravaggio. What better break from Edinburgh festival crowds than a couple of hours among the paintings of this early Baroque genius and his fascinating followers such as Orazio Gentileschi and his gifted daughter Artemisia? The warm glow of candlelit flesh will linger in your mind. Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh, to 24 September 5 Alberto Giacometti Thinned-out humanity at the end of its tether confronts you here in an exhibition that more than confirms the renowned Swiss sculptor as one of the modern world\u2019s true greats. The range and depth of Giacometti\u2019s interest in ancient art goes with a compassion for people that is unsettling and moving. His surrealist works are still shocking, his turn to expressive realism in the 1940s one of the defining moments of modern art. Tate Modern, SE1, to 10 September"
"16||The 10 best things to do this week: Kesha and King LearMusic PJ Harvey Performing over two nights, Polly Jean Harvey brings a nine-piece band and her trusty friend the saxophone to the Edinburgh Playhouse as part of the city\u2019s international festival. Expect songs from last year\u2019s Grammy-nominated, UK No 1 album The Hope Six Demolition Project as well as hits from her catalogue. Edinburgh Playhouse, 7-8 August Houghton festival This lakeside boutique fest in Norfolk offers up a plethora of high-end electronic artists - Hercules &amp; Love Affair, Ricardo Villalobos, Nicolas Jaar - plus some art and sculpture to scare you at 3am from the likes of Rachel Whiteread and Zhan Wang. Starts on Thursday. Houghton Hall, King\u2019s Lynn, 10-13 August Kesha Following her much-publicised legal struggles with former producer Dr Luke, Kesha (now sans the $) is back with Rainbow, her first album in almost five years. Cathartic lead single Praying suggests fans can expect a lot of laser-guided anger (one song is called Bastards, for example), while recent track Woman \u2013 written in response to Donald Trump\u2019s remarks about grabbing women \u2013 is a horn-laced, whiskey-soaked, feminist anthem. The eclectic Rainbow features collaborations with Eagles of Death Metal, her mum Pebe and the actual Dolly Parton. Out on 11 August Theatre King Lear Director Nancy Meckler and Pirates of the Caribbean actor Kevin McNally headline Shakespeare\u2019s epic tragedy. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Theatre, SE1, from 10 August Visions festival Wellies, mud and those cheap Technicolor rain macs be damned! Taking place across eight (indoor!) venues, Visions showcases some of music\u2019s most promising upstarts including DIY indie rabble Goat Girl; gonzo pop producer SOPHIE; and Norwegian experimentalist Jenny Hval. If you get a bit bored of all the live music, there\u2019s also a dog show judged by the Mystery Jets. Various venues, mostly E8, 5 August Exhibitions Matisse in the Studio As the title suggests, this exhibition offers a rare glimpse into Henri Matisse\u2019s studio, showcasing the vast array of found objects - including Buddhist statuary from Thailand, Chinese calligraphy and textiles from north Africa \u2013 that would go on to inspire his paintings, sculptures and drawings. London\u2019s Royal Academy of Arts, W1, until 12 November Film A Ghost Story Despite appearances in its early trailers and posters, David Lowery\u2019s A Ghost Story is more of a drip-feed psychological drama than a jump out of your skin, empty your bowels horror. It tells the story of a grieving Rooney Mara, haunted by her late husband Casey Affleck wearing an old Ikea sheet with eye holes cut out. Over time Mara moves on with her life, while Affleck is left knocking about their old house as ghosts are wont to do. Expect muted colours, indie actor crying and the urge to buy some new bedding. In cinemas from 11 August The Floating Cinema It\u2019s official: no one goes to a proper cinema any more. Watching films in a warm room, sitting in a comfy chair piled high with some delicious snacks is now as passe as eating food off actual plates. At Hull Marina, for example, you can watch a selection of celluloid curios, including the newly commissioned On the Bench, via a big screen resting on a barge. Hull Marina, 7-13 August Podcasts The Two Shot Podcast Line of Duty\u2019s Craig Parkinson sits down with a fortnightly guest to chat honestly about the occasional highs and often crushing lows of being an actor. The first episode \u2013 available at podbean.com \u2013 features This Is England and LoD\u2019s Vicky McClure, while former man behaving badly Neil Morrissey (also ex-LoD) and Happy Valley\u2019s Susan Lynch (who is Parkinson\u2019s wife) have also appeared so far. The Nod Presented by Brittany Luse and Eric Eddings, this podcast explores all aspects of black culture, with one particularly amazing episode diving headlong into the murky world of YouTube conspiracy theories, specifically one alleging Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z forced Solange into being their children\u2019s surrogate."
"6||I\u2019m giving up the \u2018sharenting\u2019 \u2013 for the sake of my childrenWhen I made the decision, a month ago, to take myself off social media for a year, I did so for various reasons. Not least because my two-year-old had taken to running up to me with a worried expression, shouting \u201cmummy, your phone!\u201d whenever he found it not in my hand for more than five minutes. Having amassed some 10,000 Instagram followers as editor of Motherland, the online parenting magazine I ran for two years, I had watched myself mutate from the sort of person who purposely only ever uploaded photos of my kids in an \u201cironic\u201d way, and only ever occasionally (\u201cSee my child being a total monster as we queue for soft-play on Mother\u2019s Day!\u201d sort of thing) to the kind who seemed to be obsessively spamming my various online profiles across Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, with fragments of my life. Like many of the 56% of British parents who prefer to keep their family photos and videos away from social media, according to a new report by Ofcom, I worry about my children\u2019s privacy. Many of us have become desensitised over the years to such public sharing: since first joining Facebook in 2007, my tolerance for sharing has steadily increased so that, whereas once I wouldn\u2019t even let a newspaper print my daughter\u2019s name in an article to protect her anonymity, these days I have become emotionally incontinent about almost every aspect of my life \u2013 and that of my three children. In exiting social media, I was also interested to see how stepping away from the constant objectification would affect my everyday behaviour and outlook, as well as my relationship with my kids who, as with many modern offspring, are used to being photographed approximately 392 times a day. According to yesterday\u2019s research on \u201csharenting\u201d, taken from Ofcom\u2019s annual Communications Market Report, people take on average six photos before choosing a selfie to post online, while young people can take as many as 20 \u2013 almost half of those posting selfies say they edit the photo before they share it online. That is particularly troubling as I very firmly don\u2019t want my kids to be conscious of how they look. I want them to be free to play and be kids for as long as possible, without an early onset of the crippling self-awareness that partly defines adulthood. So when I found myself regularly walking into a room, seeing my kids embroiled in a lovely imaginary game and shouting \u201cDON\u2019T MOVE, I NEED TO FIND MY BLOODY CAMERA\u201d, I knew something wasn\u2019t right. Heavy-hearted, I would watch them shuffle into what they assumed was a more appropriate position, awkward smiles etched on to their faces while I sighed and snapped, and directed them to \u201clook more natural\u201d. I have found myself feeling uncomfortable as I\u2019ve uploaded a picture of my daughter looking like a demented car-thief on World Book Day, or my youngest son dressed as a hamster. Obviously these snapshots can be funny, and I understand why \u201chonest\u201d parenting blogs which chart the highs and lows of everyday parenting have been such bit hits. But the problem with sharing pictures of my children \u2013 who are nearly seven, nearly four, and nearly two \u2013 was really hammered home when my eldest, who has never knowingly heard of social media and certainly has no idea that I was liberally splashing her picture across the internet, saw an image in the photo album on my phone and said, with great sincerity: \u201cI hate this one, I look really sad, please delete it.\u201d Not only had I taken her picture \u2013 I had already uploaded it to Instagram the day before for all the world to see. I then wondered whether in posting pictures of my daughter, without her knowledge or permission, and telling her to smile more or smile less or smile differently, I had created a situation in which she was overly aware of her own image. According to Ofcom, 87% of parents in the UK have privacy concerns about social media, and I worry about the inevitable moment when my eldest daughter wants an account of her own. How can I lecture her on the importance of not over-exposing herself online when I\u2019m endlessly putting out details myself? I don\u2019t want to demonstrate to my children a situation where I\u2019m constantly objectifying my own life, and I don\u2019t want my kids to feel they need to make themselves into a brand, in the way that many of us have, willingly or otherwise. One of the questions I\u2019ve had from people about my self-inflicted social hiatus is why don\u2019t I just stay on the sites but stop uploading so many pictures? The sad truth is I began to feel that I was becoming a real-life manifestation of the old philosophical quandary about the tree falling in the woods when no one is there to see it; without an observer, did it really fall at all? The problem for some of us is that even when you know the reasons why you shouldn\u2019t, you do it anyway. Ultimately, I began to wonder how many times I\u2019d missed out on a special moment with my kids because I was too busy trying to capture it for social media. A month into my exile, I am happy to report I rarely know where my phone is any more \u2013 and my kids now don\u2019t bother delivering it back to me. \u2022 Charlotte Philby is the former editor of the website Motherland"
