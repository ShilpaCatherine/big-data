Tom Begaye, a 27-year-old Navajo man from Waterflow, New Mexico, is accused of luring Ashlynne Mike into his van with promises of watching the movie Zootopia. The siblings were abducted after being dropped off at a bus stop after school, about a quarter of a mile from their home on Monday afternoon. The brother and another boy \u2013 their cousin \u2013 said no to the movie offer, but Ashlynne was lured into the van. The girl\u2019s brother who, according to a federal affidavit released on Wednesday, also jumped into the van hoping to protect her, was later discovered walking down a desert highway where he had been left by the kidnapper. His sister\u2019s body wasn\u2019t found until the next day, her head bloodied and bashed with a crowbar. According to the affidavit, Begaye told investigators he removed the girl\u2019s clothing, preparing to sexually assault her, and that he hit her twice in the head with a crowbar because she was crying and begging to be taken home. He also said that the girl was still moving when he left her for dead in the desert. US magistrate judge B Paul Briones told Begaye he could face life in prison if convicted of the murder charge. As he was taken away in an SUV after the hearing, people outside the courthouse yelled \u201cbastard\u201d and \u201cgo to hell\u201d. Rickie Nez, a cousin of the victim who was in court to see her alleged killer arraigned on Wednesday morning, told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. We are a peaceful people; we care about one another. But now [one of] our own people has allegedly committed this thing, and it\u2019s horrible. [Now] we have to start going to our schools and teach children to stop speaking to strangers.\u201d The case has raised questions about the capacity of authorities to respond to abductions in remote areas of the Navajo Nation. Nez said that while the pair\u2019s disappearance was reported by their father to the Navajo police just before 7pm, it took until 2.30am for the FBI to authorize an amber alert, a delay that Nez said would not have happened if the abduction had taken place in Albuquerque or Farmington. In the meantime, community members who heard about the abduction via radio and social media congregated to join in the search on Monday around 9pm and again on Tuesday morning, said Graham Binaal, a Shiprock resident who joined the effort. \u201cOnce someone put it out there that there was this missing child, then the word just spread from there,\u201d he said. About 100 people from the community turned out to help look for her. It wasn\u2019t clear why it took hours for authorities to get word out about the abduction, and the FBI special agent in charge, Terry Wade, declined to answer related questions during a news conference. A tribal official, public safety director Jesse Delmar, said on Tuesday that \u201cevery protocol was followed\u201d in the New Mexico state police\u2019s issuance of the amber alert. However, the tribal president, Russell Begaye \u2013 no relation to the defendant \u2013 said in the same statement that the tribe \u201cneeds to implement an effective response system in which modern technology is utilized more effectively\u201d. Tips flooded in from across the reservation that spans parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Authorities said the kidnapper was driving a maroon van with a luggage rack but no hubcaps. In court, Begaye shuffled with shackles on. He remained quiet as the victim\u2019s relatives and other community members watched the reading of the murder and kidnapping charges. Shawn Mike, Ashlynne\u2019s cousin and the father of the boy who stayed behind, said he didn\u2019t believe the family knew Begaye. The brother called him a stranger. Waterflow is a community of about 1,600 people, just a few miles west of the girl\u2019s home in Fruitland. On Tuesday, hundreds of residents packed the Navajo Nation\u2019s San Juan chapter house in Shiprock, to remember. Ashlynne\u2019s father sat silently in the front as the girl\u2019s principal remembered her as a kind child who was a part of the school band, and local leaders offered condolences. Ashlynne was fifth-grader at Ojo Amarillo elementary school in Fruitland. She played xylophone and had a performance just last week."
"1||Body of newborn baby girl found in recycling plant in IrelandPolice have appealed for help in tracing the mother of a newborn baby girl whose body was discovered in a recycling plant in Ireland. The body of the infant was discovered by a worker at the Greenstar plant just outside Bray, County Wicklow, at about 11 o\u2019clock on Wednesday morning. The worker was sorting through rubbish when he found the remains which he initially mistook for a toy doll. Gardai have now launched an investigation into the discovery and have appealed for the mother of the child to come forward, as they believe she may be in need of urgent medical attention. Detectives said they do not know if the baby was stillborn but have confirmed that the child had been carried to term. Head of the investigation, Supt Pat Ward, said at this stage his main focus is on the baby\u2019s mother. He added: \u201cMum can be assured that if she contacts us we will be as caring as we can to her. We are making a heartfelt appeal for mum to contact us.\u201d It is believed the child died recently however further details, including the cause of death, will not be known until a full postmortem examination is carried out on Thursday. Ward said that officers are keeping an open mind about the death of the infant and told reporters that in the police\u2019s opinion \u201cit is possible the baby was stillborn\u201d. \u201cIf that is the case my priority now is to get all medical assistance and support to the baby\u2019s mum,\u201d he added. Ward said the parents of the baby could contact either himself or Sgt Sorcha Fitzpatrick at Bray gardai station, assuring the parents that the team would deal with any contact \u201cdiscreetly and sensitively\u201d."
"2||CBI calls on government to back manufacturing sector strategyBritain\u2019s leading employers\u2019 organisation will tell the government on Thursday that it needs to back a new industrial strategy to halt the decline of manufacturing and spread prosperity to the less well-off parts of the country. Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI will strongly criticise the lack of preparedness for the crisis that has engulfed the steel industry as she urges ministers to do more to help in three key areas of weakness: skills, energy costs and spending on research and development. In a speech in Warwick, Fairbairn will say: \u201cModern industrial strategy isn\u2019t about \u2018handouts\u2019 for business. It\u2019s an investment in our future competitiveness which will pay dividends in sales, exports, jobs and livelihoods.\u201d Despite pledging to rebalance growth towards industry and exports when he became chancellor in 2010, George Osborne has presided over an economy in which manufacturing output has yet to recover to its pre-recession level and the current account deficit is the highest on record. Business leaders have been privately critical of the hands-off approach the business secretary, Sajid Javed, has adopted, contrasting it with the more active role of his Liberal Democrat predecessor, Vince Cable. Fairbairn will praise the government for its support for the thriving car industry, but she will also use her speech to voice some of business\u2019s concerns. Steel gives a sharp example of where we didn\u2019t think long term. Where the answers didn\u2019t come until it was too late\u201d, she will say. \u201cYet the automotive industry provides the evidence that a clear, collaborative approach works. The industry came together, identified barriers holding back its productivity and put its top three proposals to government. \u201cGovernment acted and deserves great credit for doing so. The results have been astounding.\u201d She will say that every manufacturing sector should have a plan for its future, with each addressing three questions. \u201cFirst, is the sector strategic for the UK? Second, is the sector currently globally competitive, and if not why not? Does the UK have a competitive advantage? Third, what actions could government and business take to make it more competitive?\u201d Fairbairn will welcome the chancellor\u2019s commitment to raising productivity and protect R&amp;D spending on aerospace, aviation and automotive, but question why he has not pursued the same approach for other manufacturing sectors. \u201cIndustrial strategy needs to be by sector, because that is how the world thinks and acts. And that is how our competitors are thinking and acting. It\u2019s about co-funding from government and business in a partnership of equals. \u201cThe economic rationale is sound. Markets are not perfect \u2013 they fail in known and identified ways, particularly in the areas of skills, infrastructure and R&amp;D investment.\u201d She will also say that government funding to support innovation lags well behind that in rival countries. \u201cIn 2014, the government\u2019s contribution to the UK\u2019s total R&amp;D spend was the lowest of the G7 economies \u2013 just 0.49% of GDP.\u201d She will add that the budget for Innovate UK, the state-backed innovation agency, was 0.03% of GDP. \u201cIs that really the best we can do? Numbers so small they round down to zero? This investment matters.\u201d The CBI has long lobbied the government to reduce energy costs to levels similar to those on the continent, and Fairbairn will say that the additional burden is costing UK firms business. \u201cFor our largest users, electricity prices are still about 80% higher than the European average, double the cost of the USA. This has caused real headaches for our foundation industries. \u201cLast year, the CBI proposed that foundation industries receive appropriate support for the costs of energy and policies that are making them uncompetitive globally. We achieved this. But in the longer term, we need a clear plan from government to help develop new energy sources while keeping industry\u2019s costs under control.\u201d On skills, Fairbairn will say ministers need to address a \u201cchronic shortage of physics teachers\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is holding back an entire generation of Stem [science, technology engineering and maths] skills which manufacturing depends on.\u201d"
"3||Steptoe and Son creators honoured with Bafta fellowshipRay Galton and Alan Simpson, the writers of Hancock\u2019s Half Hour and creators of Steptoe and Son, will be honoured with a Bafta fellowship at its annual TV awards. Often credited as the creators of the situation comedy, the pair worked with Tony Hancock on Hancock\u2019s Half Hour, first on radio and later on television, from 1954 to 1961. They went on to create a second landmark sitcom with Steptoe and Son, about a father-and-son rag-and-bone business, starring Harry H Corbett and Wilfrid Brambell, which ran for eight series until 1972. In a reference to the two shows and some of Hancock\u2019s most memorable episodes, Galton said: \u201cWe are happy and honoured to accept this award on behalf of all the blood donors, test pilots, radio hams and rag and bone men of the 20th century without whom we would probably be out of a job.\u201d The fellowship is Bafta\u2019s highest accolade. Previous recipients include Julie Walters, Michael Palin, David Attenborough and Melvyn Bragg. Simpson said: \u201cWe are extremely delighted to receive the Bafta fellowship. We always wanted a fellowship, even though we did not know what a fellowship was. Not the sort of thing one associates with a couple of cockney lads, apart from Alfred Hitchcock of course.\u201d Anne Morrison, chair of Bafta, said: \u201cHaving created some of the most iconic characters and programmes over the past few decades, it comes as no surprise that Alan Simpson and Ray Galton will be receiving the Bafta fellowship this year. Alan and Ray have had such successful careers spanning over 60 years, with credits such as Steptoe and Son and Hancock\u2019s Half Hour, two hugely popular sitcoms. They are rightly considered the trailblazers of the situation comedy format.\u201d The pair, who wrote for numerous stars including Frankie Howerd and Les Dawson, met while they were being treated for tuberculosis at the same Surrey sanatorium in 1949. Acclaimed BBC2 drama Wolf Hall leads the pack with four nominations for this year\u2019s Bafta TV awards, which will be hosted by Graham Norton at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall and broadcast on BBC1."
"4||Benefits of cycling and walking 'outweigh air pollution risk' in citiesThe health benefits of cycling and walking outweigh the harm from inhaling air loaded with traffic fumes in all but the world\u2019s most polluted cities, according to a study. An international team of researchers who have modelled the effects say only 1% of cities in the world have such high levels of air pollution that cycling or walking could make a person\u2019s health worse. \u201cThe good news is that across the world, in 99% of cities it is safe to cycle up to two hours a day,\u201d said Dr Audrey de Nazelle from the centre for environmental policy at Imperial College London, one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThat\u2019s because physical inactivity is such a public health issue \u2013 it is not that pollution is not detrimental.\u201d In respect to air pollution, London is one of the safer cities in the world in which to cycle and walk, with the researchers finding it safe to do so all day. \u201cOur model indicates that in London health benefits of active travel always outweigh the risk from pollution,\u201d said Dr Marko Tainio from the Cambridge MRC epidemiology unit, who led the study. \u201cEven in Delhi, one of the most polluted cities in the world \u2013 with pollution levels ten times those in London \u2013 people would need to cycle over five hours per week before the pollution risks outweigh the health benefits. \u201cWe should remember, though, that a small minority of workers in the most polluted cities, such as bike messengers, may be exposed to levels of air pollution high enough to cancel out the health benefits of physical activity.\u201d Air pollution in major cities including London is of increasing concern, particularly to those who are regularly exposed to it when commuting to work. In February, the Royal College of Physicians published a report looking at exposure to air pollution across a lifetime and concluded that 40,000 people die as a result of it every year. The report linked polluted air to cancer, asthma, stroke and heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and dementia, and calculated that NHS, business and other costs in the UK came to more than \u00a320bn a year. The college called for tougher action against polluters and for local authorities to be given powers to close roads and divert traffic when pollution levels were high. The authors of the study, from the UK, Switzerland, Spain and Brazil, say their findings published in the journal Preventive Medicine are not a reason for complacency. \u201cWhile this research demonstrates the benefits of physical activity in spite of air quality, it is not an argument for inaction in combatting pollution,\u201d said Dr James Woodcock from the Centre for Diet and Activity Research. \u201cIt provides further support for investment in infrastructure to get people out of their cars and on to their feet or their bikes \u2013 which can itself reduce pollution levels at the same time as supporting physical activity.\u201d The researchers modelled the effects of cycling and walking at different levels of air pollution and established a tipping point \u2013 the length of time after which there was no further health benefit, and a break-even point, when the harm from air pollution began to outweigh the health benefit. For Delhi, the most polluted city on the World Health Organisation\u2019s database, the tipping and break-even points for cycling were 30 and 45 minutes per day respectively, while for walking they were 90 minutes and six hours and 15 minutes respectively. While the researchers looked at the levels of particulates \u2013 PM2.5 \u2013 in the air and not NO2, which has also been established as harming health, \u201cwe did lots of sensitivity analyses and the message would have been the same\u201d, said De Nazelle."
"2||Oil giants should ditch high-cost projects, thinktank saysShell, BP and five other top oil companies could raise their collective stock market value by up to $140bn (\u00a397bn) if they set new strategies based on ensuring global warming is held to a 2C (4F) rise above pre-industrial levels, a new report claims on Thursday. These leading energy companies including Exxon Mobil should ditch high-cost projects in deep water and Canadian tar sands to concentrate on cheaper schemes that make money at low crude prices, says the report, Sense and Sensitivity, by the Carbon Tracker Initiative. The report follows shareholder resolutions calling on oil companies to undertake \u201cstress tests\u201d on operations in the face of stronger carbon regulation and weakening fossil fuel demand as countries move to lower-carbon economies. \u201cA simple carbon sensitivity analysis shows that oil majors pursuing volume at all costs can deliver lower shareholder value than a more disciplined approach. That is why financial regulators need to make 2C stress tests standard practice for the energy sector to help avoid companies wasting capital,\u201d said James Leaton, research director at Carbon Tracker, a non-profit financial thinktank. Shell and others have been criticised by environmentalists for setting allegedly unrealistic goals for their oil and gas output that could only be realised with the Earth\u2019s temperatures rising by as much as a further 4C. The industry argues it is always trying to lower its carbon emissions while at the same time meeting the needs of a growing world population and helping to alleviate fuel poverty. The new Carbon Tracker analysis compares a business-as-usual value of the oil companies with one where only those lower-cost projects are needed to satisfy a reduced need for their products. \u201cIn a 2C world, the major oil and gas companies will need to manage declining demand for oil. However, this can still prove to be a value-add proposition if they simply avoid developing high-cost, high-carbon projects,\u201d said Mark Fulton, a former Deutche Bank analyst who is now an adviser to Carbon Tracker and co\u2010author of the new report. The analysis came as Shell reported first quarter profits down 83% to $800m and promised to speed up cost-cutting in the light of its acquisition of BG and a continued slump in oil prices."

"6||Climate change is corroding our values, says Naomi KleinClimate change is spawning injustice, racism, intolerance and wars, according to author and political activist Naomi Klein. \u201cIt is not about things getting hotter and wetter but things getting meaner and uglier, unless we change the corrosive values that are pitting people against each other,\u201d she said in a lecture held in memory of Palestinian literary critic and political activist Edward Said at the Royal Festival Hall in London\u2019s Southbank Centre on Wednesday. \u201cFossil fuels, which are the principal driver of climate change, require the sacrifice of whole regions and people. Sacrificial zones like the Niger delta and the tar sands in Alberta, Canada, dot the world. \u201cThese zones require the shredding of treaties that enable peoples to live on their land. Indigenous rights are meaningless when the land is being [destroyed] and the rivers are polluted. Resource extraction is a form of violence because it does so much damage and kills cultures,\u201d she said. The author of books including No Logo and This Changes Everything said that an epidemic of despair linked to oil extraction and mining was ravaging communities in Africa and the Americas, leading to suicides and gross injustices. Klein linked the start of the Syrian crisis with drought. \u201cDrought was not the only factor but the fact that 1.5 million people were displaced exacerbated [the situation]. There is a connection between water stress and conflict in the Middle East, Libya, Gaza, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Today boats of refugees flee wars and drought. Migrants are seen as an invading army.\u201d In a reference to Said\u2019s argument that large sections of humanity have been cast as sub-human, or \u201cother\u201d, Klein said climate change was creating great divisions between people. \u201cThere is no clean, safe way to run an economy built on fossil fuels. There is no peaceful way to do it ... If nations and people are regarded as other, it\u2019s easier to wage wars and stage coups,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are running out of cheap ways to get to fossil fuels. This sees the rise of fracking which is now threatening some of the prettiest places in Britain.\u201d She urged people to make the links between climate change and conflict. \u201cAnti-austerity people rarely talk about climate change. And climate change people rarely talk about war. Overcoming these disconnections is the most pressing task for anyone occupied with social justice. \u201c[Climate change] is a a present emergency. The Paris agreement, signed last month commits to keeping warming to below 2C. But this is reckless. In 2009, African nations said this was a death sentence. At the last minute [in Paris] countries agreed to \u201cpursue efforts\u201d to limit warming further. [But] we are making no such efforts.\u201d \u201cWealthy people think that they are going to be OK, that they will be taken care of. But we all will be affected,\u201d she said."
"0||Trump says of campaign sacrifice: 'I gave up two seasons of Celebrity Apprentice'In his first sitdown interview as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump refused to back down on his longstanding \u2013 and long-since debunked \u2013 claims that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, and also refused to denounce antisemitic attacks on a journalist who wrote a profile about his wife. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, Trump doubled down on some of his most controversial and inflammatory positions, claiming his statements about the president\u2019s nationality or his attempts to link the father of former rival Ted Cruz to the assassination of John F Kennedy were proportional to attacks waged against himself. \u201cI\u2019ve given up a tremendous amount to run for president,\u201d Trump told Blitzer. \u201cI gave up two more seasons of Celebrity Apprentice.\u201d Blitzer asked Trump specifically to address his supporters who had sent \u201cvicious\u201d messages to journalist Julia Ioffe this week. After her profile of Donald Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, appeared in this month\u2019s issue of GQ, the Russian-American journalist received a torrent of antisemitic and threatening messages from supporters of the Republican frontrunner. \u201cI don\u2019t have a message to the fans \u2013 I\u2019m not gonna talk about that,\u201d Trump said, calling Ioffe\u2019s story \u201cnasty\u201d and defending his wife against unspecified falsehoods in the piece. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to have bad things said about her,\u201d he said of his wife. Trump protested that he knew nothing of any antisemitic or abusive comments and threats directed at Ioffe. When Blitzer asked Trump about his past support of \u201cbirtherism\u201d \u2013 the fervent and unsubstantiated belief that Obama was secretly born outside of the United States and is therefore constitutionally ineligible for the presidency, Trump pinned his past statements on his likely opponent in the general election: Hillary Clinton. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who started it,\u201d Trump said. The billionaire has long argued that the former secretary of state was the instigator in the birther movement, although evidence for this assertion has not surfaced. Trump, whose senior campaign staff have intimated to Republican party leadership that the candidate would moderate his tone in the general election, also refused to walk back statements on other hot-button issues, including his signature proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigration into the United States. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I mean, look, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said, when Blitzer asked if such a proposal would alienate America\u2019s allies in the Middle East. \u201cThe migration is a disaster \u2013 we\u2019re letting in thousands of people. They don\u2019t have documentation, they don\u2019t have paperwork, we don\u2019t know who they are or where they come from.\u201d In an interview with the New York Times Trump said he would implement the ban within his first 100 days, the paper reported. He also declared that his suggestion that US troop presence in friendly nations should be subsidized was still a key feature of his proposed national security platform. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to police the entire world,\u201d Trump said, when asked if he would allow Japan and South Korea to become nuclear powers. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to walk, and if they don\u2019t take care of us properly ... they\u2019re gonna have to defend themselves.\u201d When Blitzer quoted a military estimate that it might cost more money to house American troops in the US than in Japan, Trump implied that perhaps those troops were redundant. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need them. Maybe you don\u2019t need them.\u201d"
"7||Early Kentucky Derby favorite Nyquist draws No13 postNyquist will run out of the No13 post in Saturday\u2019s 142nd running of the Kentucky Derby and is favored to become the eighth undefeated horse to win America\u2019s most famous thoroughbred race. The bay colt, owned by J Paul Reddam and trained by Doug O\u2019Neill, was installed as the 3-1 morning-line favorite at Wednesday\u2019s draw. Exaggerator, who drew the No11 post, is the the second choice at 8-1. Creator, Gun Runner and Mohaymen are joint third favorites at 10-1, breaking from the No3, No5 and No14 posts, respectively. Unbeaten in seven career starts, Nyquist emerged from prep season as the dominant three-year-old, a status confirmed with his win in the Grade I Florida Derby over the also-unbeaten Mohaymen at Gulfstream Park earlier in April. The son of King Mo will try to become the eighth horse to enter the Derby undefeated and win it, joining Big Brown (2008), Barbaro (2006), Smarty Jones (2004), Seattle Slew (1977), Majestic Prince (1969), Morvich (1922) and Regret (1915). Four horses have won from the No13 post since the introduction of a starting gate at Churchill Downs in 1930, most recently Smarty Jones.

"8||California recreational marijuana initiative will be on the November ballotLieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Wednesday that the first of more than a dozen initiatives proposed to legalize recreational marijuana in California, the biggest pot producer in the US, has collected enough signatures to appear on the ballot in November. Flanked by sober-suited supporters, a doctor in a white coat, the head of the state NAACP and one very conservative Republican congressman, Newsom called the Adult Use of Marijuana Act \u2013 which was bankrolled by Napster founder Sean Parker \u2013 \u201ca game changer\u201d, an antidote to what he described as the failed and racist war on drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that any others will qualify,\u201d Newsom said of the competing measures. \u201cWe have qualified. We are north of 600,000 signatures. That is beyond what is needed. We need a little less than 400,000. You can rest assured this will be on the November ballot.\u201d Newsom challenged voters and elected officials in the biggest state in the US \u2013 and, in 1996, the first to legalize medical marijuana \u2013 to step up and support the measure, which he has supported since its inception. Its proponents say the measure contains protections for children and will funnel tax money to strapped law enforcement agencies. \u201cIf you\u2019re sick and tired of race-based sentencing, you\u2019d better be serious about this initiative,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a parent, pay attention to this initiative \u2026 I believe it\u2019s very important, and I am hopeful that the people of California agree.\u201d In some ways, the most counterintuitive supporter at the afternoon news conference was Dana Rohrabacher, a conservative California congressman from deeply red Orange County who supported the now-defunct presidential campaign of Texas senator Ted Cruz. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a bigger waste of government money than to try to use it to control the private lives of adults,\u201d the Republican said. The federal government is taking billions of dollars away from the forest service and other critical agencies, he said, which are \u201cbeing defunded to maintain a war on drugs that is philosophically wrong\u201d. To date, four states and the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of pot. Colorado and Washington state, where ballot measures succeeded in 2012, were the first, followed by Oregon, Alaska and DC. A February public health analysis by tobacco researchers at the UC San Francisco Medical School panned the 64-page measure. Stanton Glantz, a nationally known anti-tobacco activist, is a co-author of the report, which looked at the Adult Use of Marijuana Act and one other initiative. Analysis of the measures \u201cis based on the premise that treating marijuana like tobacco \u2013 legal but unwanted \u2013 under a public health framework is an appropriate response to the social inequities and large public costs of the failed War on Drugs,\u201d the report said. But \u201cthe two major legalization initiatives do not accomplish this goal\u201d, the researchers concluded, in part because they \u201care written primarily to create a new business and only include minimal protections for the public that are unlikely to prevent public health harms caused by the burgeoning marijuana industry\u201d. Still, this has been a good week for marijuana supporters in California. Hours before the initiative announcement in San Francisco, the city council in neighboring Oakland approved regulations to license and tax medical marijuana within its boundaries. Oakland is now believed to be the first city to allow people with marijuana convictions to have \u201cequity ownership\u201d in dispensaries or to work in them. \u201cCalifornians have made it clear that they want people to have safe, legal access to medical marijuana,\u201d Oakland\u2019s mayor, Libby Schaaf, said in a written statement. \u201cI\u2019m proud that by adopting groundbreaking medical cannabis regulations, Oakland is creating a national model for how communities can bring every aspect of this growing sector of our economy into the light.\u201d On Tuesday, Oakland officials and the proprietors of what is considered to be the biggest medical marijuana dispensary in the country held a jubilant press conference at city hall to celebrate the federal government\u2019s agreement to drop its four-year effort to close Harborside Health Center. The US Department of Justice still classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, regardless of the move across the country to legalize its use. In addition to the states that have approved party pot, 23 have approved the use of medical marijuana. Measures to legalize recreational cannabis are expected to be on the ballot in November in California, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Massachusetts and Maine, said Allen St Pierre, executive director of NORML, and medical marijuana is expected on the ballot in Florida and Missouri. \u201cThis is the busiest year ever for reformers\u201d of marijuana laws, St Pierre said."

City lost the semi-final second leg 1-0 \u2013 and the tie by the same score \u2013 due to Fernando\u2019s own-goal that came from a Gareth Bale shot after 20 minutes, with Vincent Kompany having been taken off 10 minutes earlier due to the 33rd injury of his time at the club. Pellegrini\u2019s side were uninspired throughout yet the Chilean insisted he had no regrets about the approach to the game. Instead he pointed to a lack of creativity from both teams but did concede disappointment at City failing to reach the showpiece in Milan on 28 May. \u201cOf course if you don\u2019t reach the final you miss an opportunity,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cWe played against a very strong team that wasn\u2019t better than us. You need a little bit of luck but that wasn\u2019t the reason we couldn\u2019t win the game. Tonight and the game we played at the Etihad we saw very equal teams. I don\u2019t think Real Madrid demonstrated tonight that they are better than Manchester City. \u201cWe tried to create but we couldn\u2019t. Both teams couldn\u2019t create. It was similar in the first leg. We didn\u2019t deserve to lose this game, the goal was very lucky, a deflection into the top corner. Missing David Silva, [Samir] Nasri [who is not in the Champions League squad] and Yaya [Tour\u00e9] coming from an injury we didn\u2019t have creative players to make a difference. \u201cNo, there are no regrets, we worked very well for 90 minutes. That\u2019s why Real Madrid couldn\u2019t create any chances. But we needed to create in the final third and today we couldn\u2019t.\u201d This was only Kompany\u2019s second start following a knee problem that had ruled him out for a month. Yet the captain again went down with an injury that may prompt questions about his career. Pellegrini said: \u201cOf course it was not the best way to start the semi-final to lose your captain. But we didn\u2019t have any problem defending without Vincent. What we didn\u2019t have tonight was the creative players to make the difference. We\u2019ll see tomorrow what the problem is \u2013 maybe it\u2019s his groin rather than his calf.\u201d The defeat means Pellegrini has only two more matches left of his three-season tenure before he steps aside for Pep Guardiola. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a special season because we have reached the semi-final. I don\u2019t think that we deserved to reach the final but it was a bit of luck that Real will play in the final. \u201cOf course it would have been a very important achievement to play that final. It was very important for me to try to reach that final but we did what we could and now we must try to finish well.\u201d City are in fourth place on 64 points, four ahead of Manchester United though they have played a game more. On Sunday Arsenal, who are third on 67 points with only two matches remaining, are at the Etihad. \u201cWe must now finish in the domestic games trying to qualify for next year,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cThis team must try to be in the final in the next years.\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo insisted Real deserved to go through. \u201cIt was a tough game but I think we played better than City,\u201d he said. Bale added: \u201cThe main thing is we have a chance to win the Champions League again. The reason I came to Real Madrid was to win Champions Leagues. I\u2019ve got one already and I have got another chance to win another. I feel like I am maturing. My Spanish is getting better and I\u2019m integrating more with the team. I feel like I have turned a corner in that sense and I\u2019m enjoying my football here.\u201d"
"10||Oscar-winning actors at royal reception express concern over new talentMore than 300 Oscar-winning actors, directors, writers and crew members gathered in St James\u2019s Palace on Wednesday evening at a reception hosted by the Prince of Wales, alongside the Duchess of Cornwall and visiting executives from the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences. The celebrities met by Charles and Camilla in the throne room included Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, as well as Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Jeremy Irons and Tom Hooper. Other recent winners at the reception were Mark Rylance, Jenny Beavan, Vanessa Redgrave, Jim Broadbent, Asif Kapadia, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sir Michael Caine. Upon seeing the prince, Thompson cried: \u201cIt\u2019s you! You look gorgeous.\u201d She later explained: \u201cHe\u2019s an old friend. And I will always make a loud noise when he comes into any room, and he knows that. But he does ask me to pipe down. Someone\u2019s got to do it. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of gigs for HRH in the old days when he wanted entertaining. I\u2019ve got my own cap and bells.\u201d Thompson, who won an Oscar in 1993 for her role in Howards End and an adapted screenplay award in 1996 for Sense and Sensibility, has never played royalty and said she harboured no desire to do so. \u201cThey\u2019re much better at it than any of us could ever be,\u201d she said, before praising the royal family\u2019s ability to juggle \u201ctheir private lives\u201d with \u201cthe role they have to play in society, which is very demanding\u201d. Caine likewise said he had not considered playing a king and \u201cnever thought of myself in the royal mould. I\u2019m definitely working class. I can\u2019t think of a single royal who has a cockney accent. Maybe I\u2019ll be that little boy who\u2019s just been born, when he grows up.\u201d The actor, who is now 83, has been nominated six times for an Oscar and won twice \u2013 for Hannah and her Sisters and The Cider House Rules. A fortnight ago, the prince took to the stage to read lines from Hamlet alongside the likes of Dench and Benedict Cumberbatch at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford\u2019s event to mark the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare\u2019s death. Caine reported himself \u201cstunned\u201d by the performance: \u201cI thought it was going to be an impressionist. Then he did it and he did it very well.\u201d Despite this, however, Thompson said she thought the connection between the monarchy and the performing arts had been stronger in previous centuries. \u201cParticularly with the Princes of Wales, of course, because they were very keen on their actresses. Obviously the Prince of Wales now has no time or truck with such unstable characters. The Queen would think we\u2019re all just frivolous and dreadful and can\u2019t ride.\u201d Cheryl Boone, the president of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences, who appeared alongside the chief executive, Dawn Hudson, said British talent had been disproportionately dominant at the Oscars because of the country\u2019s \u201ccommitment to training and the craft and creative\u201d. The evening \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 comes as Isaacs seeks to shake up the membership of Academy voters following criticism that no non-white people were nominated for acting Oscars for the second consecutive year. At Wednesday\u2019s event, Isaacs would not be drawn on whether she felt the UK was more or less effective than the US at promoting diverse talent. Yet some of the winners present expressed scepticism about the extent to which on-screen talent was representative of the country at large. Dench reported that she, like fellow Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne, had funded acting students unable to afford their fees and rent. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying that training is so expensive. I don\u2019t know how many letters I get a week from young actors wanting to go to drama school and not having the money to get them through.\u201d Caine, meanwhile, said he was concerned that the popularity of reality shows was leaving many people ill equipped both to enter the business and then to deal with getting exposure too early. \u201cThese days they just say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be an actor because I want to be rich and famous.\u2019 They can\u2019t really act. \u201cI\u2019ve watched it ruin people,\u201d said Caine of short-lived acclaim. \u201cBy the time they\u2019re 30 they\u2019re through.\u201d Thompson echoed the sentiment, saying: \u201cI think early fame is generally speaking pretty disastrous,\u201d and adding that social media exacerbates such situations, \u201cbecause it interferes with your capacity to develop because it\u2019s so difficult to fail. You can\u2019t fail privately and failure is such an important part of learning. For some people it\u2019s just too hard.\u201d She also bemoaned the increasing trend for studios to cast actors based on the scope of their following on Twitter, as well as the co-opting of non-actors into the profession on the back of their social media profile. \u201cIf they\u2019re good then, all right, fine. But I\u2019d say that is rare. Perhaps it\u2019s fuddy-duddy of me to be worried [about social media], but it does worry me dreadfully.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 May 2016. An earlier version said Emma Thompson won an Oscar for her role in The Remains of the Day. She was nominated for that film, but won the Oscar the previous year for her role in Howards End."
"1||Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff could face criminal chargeIn what are expected to be her last days as president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff has reportedly been accused by the country\u2019s prosecutor general of obstructing justice. The criminal allegation \u2013 which she denies \u2013 adds the risk of prison to the woes of the Workers party leader, who is likely to be forced to step aside next week while the senate debates a separate impeachment motion against her. If the request for an investigation is accepted by the supreme court, it would also tarnish her reputation by placing her for the first time among the targets of the high-profile Lava Jato (Car Wash) inquiry into political kickbacks from the state-run oil company, Petrobras. Among those already under investigation are the former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the house speaker, Eduardo Cunha, the leader of the senate, Renan Calheiros, and about 50 other prominent lawmakers from across the political spectrum. According to local media, the prosecutor general, Rodrigo Janot, has ramped up the ante this week by asking permission from the supreme court to investigate 30 cases. As well as Lula \u2013 who is described as the ringleader of the Petrobras corruption scheme \u2013 they are said to include two of the most prominent figures in the opposition Brazilian Social Democracy party \u2013 A\u00e9cio Neves, the losing candidate in the 2014 presidential election, and lower house deputy Carlos Sampaio \u2013 as well as heavyweights in the powerful Brazilian Democratic Movement party, such as Senator Romero Juca and the Rio de Janeiro mayor, Eduardo Paes, the leading figure in the organisation of the upcoming Olympics. Worst hit, though, has been the Workers party, which looks set to lose power next week for the first time in 13 years. Among those whose cases were referred to the supreme court this week are Lula, the social communications minister, Edinho Silva, Jaques Wagner, who heads the president\u2019s office, and the attorney general, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Cardozo. The biggest news, however, was the reported inclusion of Rousseff, who is accused of trying to impede the Lava Jato investigation. Until now, Rousseff has not been implicated in a crime, unlike many of her accusers in parliament. Rousseff says she is innocent and blames a plea bargain by Senator Delc\u00eddio do Amaral. \u201cAny opening of an investigation I am sure will show that Senator Delc\u00eddio do Amaral was lying,\u201d Rousseff told domestic media. In his testimony, Do Amaral also said a \u201cgodfather\u201d role at Petrobras was played by Vice-President Michel Temer, who is expected to form a new government next week. However, Temer\u2019s case does not appear to have been referred to the supreme court. Janot has yet to confirm the investigations or to explain his motive for acting now, in the dog days of the Workers party administration. Some commentators speculate that he is helping the new administration by tarnishing the reputation of the old. Others suggest he is pushing ahead as quickly as possible due to uncertainty about the future of the Lava Jato investigation under a new justice minister. The supreme court must now decide whether to accept Janot\u2019s requests, a process that could take months or years."
"1||Justice Department says North Carolina anti-LGBT law violates Civil Rights ActNorth Carolina\u2019s law limiting protections to LGBT people violates the US Civil Rights Act and cannot be enforced, the US Justice Department said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, in Alabama, the town of Oxford buckled under public pressure and repealed a recently enacted bathroom ordinance that threatened six months in jail for anyone found using a toilet not in line with his or her biological sex. Federal officials have recently warned states against discriminating against transgender students in school bathrooms, and a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a transgender high school student suing a school board for access to the boys\u2019 bathroom. But the letter to the state of North Carolina from Vanita Gupta, principal deputy assistant US attorney general, marked the federal government\u2019s first direct intervention in the conflict. \u201cThe Department of Justice has determined that, as a result of compliance with and implementation of NC House Bill2, both you and the state of NC are in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\u201d Gupta wrote to the Republican governor, Pat McGrory. The act prohibits employers from discriminating against people based on gender identity. \u201cAccess to sex-segregated restrooms and other workplace facilities consistent with gender identity is a term, condition or privilege of employment,\u201d Gupta wrote. \u201cDenying such access to transgender individuals, whose gender identity is different from the gender assigned at birth, while affording it to similarly situated non-transgender employees, violates Title VII.\u201d The letter called HB2 is \u201cfacially discriminatory against transgender employees on the basis of sex because it treats transgender employees, whose gender identity does not match their biological sex, as defined by HB2, differently from similarly situated non-transgender employees\u201d. The letter also cited Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in education. If a court upholds the US attorney general\u2019s position, the state of North Carolina stands to lose $861m in federal funding for schools. \u201cThis letter from the Department of Justice confirms what was clear from the start: HB2 is discriminatory and unconstitutional,\u201d said Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, executive director of advocacy group Campaign for Southern Equality, which is based in Asheville, North Carolina. \u201cWe continue to call for the immediate repeal of HB2. We also call for the North Carolina general assembly to pass full legal protections for the LGBT North Carolinians.\u201d The North Carolina law limits legal protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and requires transgender people to use public bathrooms that conform to the sex on their birth certificate. In Alabama, the city council of Oxford voted 3-2 to recall the ordinance it passed a week ago banning anyone using a toilet not in line with his or her biological sex. The law had declared that bathroom offenders \u201cshall be punished by fine not to exceed $500 or incarceration not to exceed six months.\u201d \u201cThe Oxford City Council did the right thing by recalling its discriminatory ordinance,\u201d Chinyere Ezie, a staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, told the Guardian by email. \u201cWe are pleased the council members came to the conclusion that nobody should be criminalized simply for using the restroom.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report"
"11||Apple Music is being overhauled? Good - here's what it needs to doWhen Apple debuted its Music subscription service at its June 2015 worldwide developers conference, it did so in grand style with appearances by music impresario Jimmy Iovine and a performance by Drake. Apple Music was brimming with features: access to a library of 30m tunes, a 24/7 Beats One radio station, curated playlists and integration with your existing library of music downloads. With Apple Music, the company was hoping to shore up sagging iTunes revenues and drown out rival streaming services like Spotify, Pandora and Tidal. Apple even gave subscribers three months to fall in love with the new service; within a few weeks more than 11 million users signed up for the free trial. But before it was even half over, some 48% had decided to cancel before the $10 monthly fee kicked in, according to a survey by analytics firm MusicWatch. Music fans weren\u2019t exactly holding their lighters over their heads, screaming for more. Problems ranged from a cluttered and confusing interface, a royalties program that angered popular artists (most famously Taylor Swift), and upgrades that thoroughly bollixed subscribers\u2019 existing iTunes libraries. Since then, key executives with Apple\u2019s Beats subsidiary have left the company. Even iTunes international VP Oliver Schusser admitted the service \u201chad a bit of homework\u201d to do. Nearly a year after Apple Music\u2019s debut, however, the company wants to take another crack at it. According to a report by Bloomberg, the company plans to launch an improved version of the music service at its WWDC next month, along with another massive marketing push. (Apple declined to confirm the news to Bloomberg.) The report was short on details on how Apple intends to pump up the service. But assuming it\u2019s true, we have a few unsolicited suggestions. \u2022 Make it simpler, stupid. Apple Music\u2019s interface totally lacks the simplicity that has been the hallmark of great Apple products. Fewer options, especially on such a small screen, would be welcome. \u2022 More free radio stations. In January, Apple restricted access to its ad-supported iTunes radio stations to paying subscribers, leaving Beats One the sole free radio option. If Apple wants to convince skeptics its service is worth $120 a year, it needs to offer more than the limited tastes of Beats\u2019 DJs. \u2022 A free ad-supported version. It works for Spotify, which has 55 million free users (and 20 million paid). Why not Apple? \u2022 A downvote option. You can heart your favorite songs, but you can\u2019t tell Apple to stop suggesting artists you don\u2019t like. Apple Music needs to make better personalized music suggestions, and adding a Pandora-like thumbs-down option (the anti-Drake button, as I call it) would help. \u2022 Lose \u201cConnect\u201d. Apple Music\u2019s Connect service was supposed to bridge the gap between artists and their fans, offering them exclusive photos, videos and music. But many artists have ignored it, and it mostly seems like another attempt to sell more stuff. I doubt anyone would even notice it was gone. \u2022 Better desktop and web clients. If you want to listen to Apple Music on your computer, you need to run the resource-hogging and overly complicated iTunes software. Would a simple web client be too much to ask? Or even just a stripped-down desktop app? If Apple wants a whole lotta love for Apple Music 2.0, it needs to make sure the song does not remain the same."
"0||Obama in Flint: water crisis is a 'tragedy that never should have happened'The Flint water crisis was a \u201ctragedy that never should have happened\u201d in the US, Barack Obama said Wednesday during his first visit to the city since evidence of lead contamination emerged last fall, while residents jeered Michigan\u2019s governor in his first public remarks before the community. \u201cFlint\u2019s recovery is everybody\u2019s responsibility,\u201d the president told a crowd of 1,000 gathered inside a high school gymnasium. \u201cAnd I will make sure that responsibility is met.\u201d The president focused his remarks on what he called a \u201ccorrosive\u201d mentality in politics that \u201ccontributed to this crisis\u201d. \u201cNow, I do not believe that anybody consciously wanted to hurt the people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is not the place to sort out every screwup \u2026 but I do think there\u2019s a larger issue. \u201cIt\u2019s a mindset that believes the less government is the highest good no matter what,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s an \u2026 ideology that undervalues the common good, says we\u2019re all on our own.\u201d The president\u2019s trip included a discussion with nine residents and a local pediatrician, Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha, who last fall uncovered elevated blood lead levels in Flint children. \u201cI told them that I understood why you\u2019re afraid, not just for yourself but for your kids,\u201d Obama said during his 50-minute speech. \u201cI also want to come here to tell you that: I\u2019ve got your back; that we\u2019re paying attention.\u201d The president\u2019s visit also ushered in the first public remarks to Flint residents from Michigan governor Rick Snyder since he conceded the city\u2019s water was contaminated seven months ago. From the moment Snyder stepped on stage, attendees booed and jeered the second-term Republican governor, who won the state gubernatorial race in 2010 without ever serving public office. As he has in recent months, the governor apologized for his administration\u2019s role in the crisis \u2013 but his remarks were brief. The former venture capitalist could barely get a word in without an interruption. \u201cYou didn\u2019t create this problem,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cGovernment failed you.\u201d Attendees countered back: \u201cYou did!\u201d Moments later, by contrast, Flint\u2019s congressional representative, Dan Kildee, received rapturous applause from the room. \u201cThis looks like Flint,\u201d he said. Kildee criticized the efforts of emergency managers in the city who \u201cmade choices that had more to do with dollars and cents\u201d than with the health of residents. Snyder appointed a string of emergency managers between 2011 and 2015 to run Flint, essentially stripping the city\u2019s elected mayor and city council of power. In April 2014, as a cost-saving measure, the city switched its drinking water source from Lake Huron to the corrosive Flint river. State environmental officials didn\u2019t require Flint to treat the river water, which allowed lead to leach off pipes before flowing into households across the city. A Snyder-appointed taskforce found that concerns raised about the river at the time \u201cshould have resulted ... in a full and comprehensive review of the water situation in Flint\u201d. Kildee said there is an \u201cobsession\u201d with austerity in government. \u201cWe shrunk government to a point it wasn\u2019t even in a position \u2026 to defend its own people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s wrong.\u201d Obama echoed Kildee\u2019s remarks, saying austerity measures lead to \u201csystemic neglect\u201d that diminishes \u201cthe life of a community and make it harder for our young people to succeed\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not just enough to fix the water,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix the culture of neglect.\u201d At a stop at a food bank earlier on Wednesday, Obama drank from a glass of filtered Flint water, in an attempt to encourage residents to drink filtered water. \u201cIf you\u2019re using a filter \u2026 then Flint water at this point is drinkable,\u201d Obama said, cautioning, however, that pregnant women and children younger than six should continue using bottled water. Residents have expressed the overreliance on bottled water, out of safety, has become an unnerving reality in the city. But, as a short-term measure, Obama said using filtered tap water is the \u201cright thing to do\u201d. \u201cAnd, frankly, it\u2019s going to be a lot more convenient than people traveling long distances to try to lug back a bunch of bottled water,\u201d he said. The president said Flint should still push forward with an effort spearheaded by Flint mayor Karen Weaver to remove lead service lines across the city. Weaver has estimated the city needs $55m to complete pipe replacement, and only about $2m has been appropriated for the effort so far \u2013 enough to remove roughly 500 lines in a city estimated to have about 15,000. \u201cThat may be a long-term process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may take a year, it may take two years. \u2026 In the meantime, folks have to be able to use water.\u201d Obama told reporters after the briefing that Flint parents should have their kids tested for lead exposure and said, with proactive measures, long-term health effects of lead can be reigned in. \u201cWe now know what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know how to mitigate these effects.\u201d He also encouraged residents to flush their pipes so federal environmental officials can analyze whether Flint\u2019s pipes are being recoated with corrosion-control agents. \u201cSo I\u2019m urging everybody in Flint to participate in this flushing program,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s a matter of turning on your tap in the kitchen, in the bathroom, five minutes a day, just to get that water flowing, getting some of the contaminants out. It will then be retested after that.\u201d Weaver said she was encouraged to know that Obama is concerned about the \u201cman-made\u201d water disaster. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve what happened here,\u201d she said before Obama took the stage. \u201cBut we do deserve the resources to fix it.\u201d The president\u2019s visit was prompted by a letter from an eight-year-old Flint resident. Mari Copeny, who is known around the city as Little Miss Flint. Copeny urged Obama in her letter to meet with the community, as it would \u201creally lift people\u2019s spirits\u201d. He also met with Flint residents in a community roundtable prior to delivering his remarks at the high school. \u201cI am confident that Flint will come back,\u201d Obama said. The president highlighted federal remediation efforts in Flint ahead of Wednesday\u2019s speech, saying Obama has directed an \u201call-out\u201d response to address the city\u2019s water crisis: federal aid, prompted by an emergency declaration issued in January, has provided over 9m liters of water, along with 50,000 filters for Flint residents, according to the White House. Obama green-lighted an expansion of Medicaid coverage in the city for 14,000 children and 1,000 pregnant women. Snyder said on Tuesday that Flint residents would be available for the expansion next week. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been authorized to continue providing water, filters, and water test kits through mid-August, the White House said. Snyder, whose aides first learned of concerns over lead contamination, publicly conceded last October that Flint residents had been exposed to high levels of lead. The governor, however, has sought to distance himself from criticism for his months-long delay in launching a widespread response. Nearly $70m is being appropriated by the state legislature to reconnect Flint with Detroit\u2019s water system, begin testing for lead, and provide bottled water to residents. Snyder activated the national guard to assist, and has proposed an additional $165m for further measures. With 40% of the majority-black city living below the poverty line, however, residents say there\u2019s still a disconnect between the needs of Flint\u2019s 100,000 residents. The family of Copeny has endured a series of irritating skin rashes, even after Flint began pulling water again from Lake Huron last fall, her mother said this week. Lead isn\u2019t a known cause for skin irritation, but state officials, along with assistance from the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have continued to investigate what causes the rashes. Earlier, students and residents lined the road outside Northwestern, where organizers of a recall petition for Snyder gathered signatures. Nearly halfway through Obama\u2019s speech, the president broke out with a momentary cough, prompting a light-hearted moment, when he asked to applause: \u201cI\u2019m gonna get a glass of water.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s make sure we find one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be filtered.\u201d"
"12||An Enemy of the People review \u2013 Hugh Bonneville's whistleblower is a man of our timesThis is the fifth major revival in eight years of Ibsen\u2019s study of a Nordic whistleblower. Even if Howard Davies\u2019s vigorous production cannot match the volatility of Thomas Ostermeier\u2019s recent German version \u2013 in which audience members were encouraged to air their own spontaneous political protests, as in a rowdy version of Question Time \u2013 it brings Hugh Bonneville back to the stage after 12 years. Having played an aristocrat of the blood in Downton Abbey, he now rises successfully to the more strenuous challenge of embodying Ibsen\u2019s faith in aristocracy of the intellect. Ibsen\u2019s Dr Stockmann is a tricky character. In the first half, we find ourselves rooting for him as a champion of truth. In his role as a thriving spa\u2019s chief medical officer, he discovers that the town\u2019s baths are contaminated and gets the backing of the press and local businessmen in demanding full disclosure. When, however, his mayoral brother casts doubt on his analysis, and reveals the huge cost of closing the baths, the mood swings against him. In the famous fourth act, Stockmann turns on the people, denounces majority opinion and calls, like a latterday Coriolanus, for the \u201cextermination\u201d of his opponents. How does one handle this? Play this 1882 piece in Victorian frock coats and it can end up looking like Jaws with whiskers. Update it totally, as David Harrower did in Public Enemy, and you turn it into an attack on a consumerist, capitalist culture that Ibsen never wrote. Davies, using Christopher Hampton\u2019s faithful translation, shrewdly adopts a middle course by setting the play in what I took to be the 1940s, with suits for the men, felt hats and slacks for the women. The shift in period chimes with Stockmann\u2019s patriarchal belief that reforming society is man\u2019s work; at the same time, it makes sense of the new spirit of feminist independence, represented by his daughter. It also hints at something we have lately discovered: that whistleblowers aren\u2019t automatically unblemished individuals. It is a point that Bonneville makes with unerring precision. In the early scenes, his Stockmann is wreathed in naive self-certainty. Bonneville beams like a baby on being told that his analysis of the baths is a masterpiece, vainly imagines the torchlit processions he will receive and hurls himself violently at unsuspecting sofas when thwarted. This element of recklessness carefully prepares us for the fourth act, when what starts as a defence of scientific fact turns into a tirade against democratic rule. In a finely judged performance, Bonneville presents us with an egoist who initially has right on his side but whose faith in the untrammelled will eventually leads to self-delusion. Not even Hampton\u2019s version can conceal the fact that the women, unusually for Ibsen, are more thinly conceived, but Abigail Cruttenden conveys the far-sighted practicality of Stockmann\u2019s wife and Alice Orr-Ewing lends his daughter a touch of fire. But small-town Norway is seen as a predominantly male world and William Gaminara as the mayor whose celibacy Bonneville mincingly mocks, Adam James as an opportunist newspaper editor and Jonathan Cullen as a printer who believes forcefully in moderation all give exactly observed performances. Even if they could be a touch more threatening, the citizens of Chichester also make a sizeable fourth-act crowd. It remains a deeply troubling play, in that Ibsen clearly shared many of Stockmann\u2019s views about the tyranny of the majority, but also a frighteningly topical one in its portrait of the way those in power suppress, or distort, truth. Every week that passes explains why it is currently Ibsen\u2019s most fashionable play. \u2022 At Chichester Festival theatre until 21 May. Box office: 01243 781 312."
"13||Neil Prakash, most senior Australian fighting with Isis, killed in Iraq airstrikeNeil Prakash, a senior Australian Islamic State operative behind a string of failed terrorist attacks in Melbourne and Sydney, has been killed in a US military airstrike in Iraq, the Australian government has announced. Shadi Jabar, the sister of the 15-year-old western Sydney boy who shot and killed police accountant Curtis Cheng last October, was killed in a separate strike in Syria, the government said on Thursday. A statement released by the attorney general and defence minister said Prakash was \u201ca prominent Isil member and a senior terrorist recruiter and attack facilitator\u201d who had been linked to several plots for terrorist attacks in Australia and calls for lone-wolf attacks against the US. \u201cHe has appeared in Isil propaganda videos and magazines and has actively recruited Australian men, women and children, and encouraged acts of terrorism. He is considered to be Australia\u2019s most prominent Isil recruiter. His death disrupts and degrades Isil\u2019s ability to recruit vulnerable people in our community to conduct terrorist acts.\u201d Prakash, the most senior Australian fighting with Islamic State, was killed last Friday along with about a dozen fighters in the suburbs of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. \u201cIf you wanted to describe him as Australia\u2019s number one terrorist you wouldn\u2019t be off the mark,\u201d George Brandis told Sky News. The child of Cambodian and Fijian migrants, Prakash reportedly ran with a series of west Melbourne gangs as a teenager and had stints as an apprentice mechanic and budding rapper. He converted to Islam in August 2012 in the company of Harun Mehicevic, a Bosnian-born radical preacher linked to Melbourne\u2019s al-Furqan Islamic Centre. Al-Furqan, in Springvale South, was closed in April last year after two 18-year-olds linked to the centre were charged with terrorism offences. Jake Bilardi, the Melbourne suicide bomber who detonated himself at a Ramadi army base in February 2015, and Numan Haider, who stabbed two police and was shot dead in a September 2014 attack, were both known to frequent al-Furqan. Prakash slipped into Syria in 2013, later surfacing in several slickly produced propaganda videos for the terrorist group. Shadi Jabar was confirmed to be in Syria only last week, when NSW police alleged 20-year-old Milad Atai had helped spirit her out of Australia on 1 October last year. The following day her teenage brother, Farhad, shot and killed 56-year-old Cheng outside Parramatta police headquarters, dying in the firefight that followed. The government said she was killed in a US air strike on 22 April along with her Sudanese husband, Abu Sa\u2019ad al-Sudani, another Isis recruiter. Brandis told Sky on Thursday: \u201cShe and her husband were both actively involved in recruitment and inspiring terrorist attacks.\u201d He told ABC radio Prakash was \u201ca very important, high value target \u2013 the most dangerous Australian involved with Isil in the Middle East\u201d.. \u201cHe was actively involved both in recruitment and in encouraging domestic terrorist events in Australia. He was the principal Australian reaching back from the Middle East into Australia, and in particular, to terrorist networks in both Melbourne and Sydney,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you take out the person who is the principal inspirer of domestic terrorism that obviously is a good thing.\u201d But Brandis said Prakash\u2019s death was \u201cby no means the end of the struggle against Isil\u201d. According to Asio estimates there were about 110 Australians \u201cengaged with\u201d Isis in the Middle East, he said. Between 50 and 59 Australians are thought to have been killed in the conflict. \u201cAustralia, in collaboration with our international partners \u2013 this was an American strike that took out Prakash \u2026 is absolutely determined to eliminate the threat to Australia posed by Isil,\u201d Brandis said."
"11||Hacker collects 272m email addresses and passwords, some from GmailThe internet on Wednesday gave you another reminder that everyone has been hacked. Hold Security, a Wisconsin-based security firm famous for obtaining hoards of stolen data from the hacking underworld, announced that it had persuaded a fraudster to give them a database of 272m unique email addresses along with the passwords consumers use to log in to websites. The escapade was detailed in a Reuters article. It might sound bad, but it is also easily mitigated. The passwords and email addresses, which include some from Gmail, Yahoo and Russia\u2019s mail.ru service, aren\u2019t necessarily the keys to millions of email accounts. Rather, they had been taken from various smaller, less secure websites where people use their email addresses along with a password to log in. People who use a different password for both their email account and, say, Target.com, won\u2019t be affected. But those who tend to use the same password for multiple sites as well as their email should change their email password. \u201cSome people use one key for everything in their house,\u201d Hold Security founder Alex Holden says. \u201cSome people have a huge set of keys that they use for each door individually.\u201d Holden said there is no way for consumers to check if their emails were included in his firm\u2019s latest find. In 2014, when his firm tried to set up such a service after obtaining a billion hacked login credentials, his site crashed. The hacker appears to have been largely targeting Russian users. Some 57m of the email addresses were for the country\u2019s largest email provider mail.ru, which claims 100 million monthly users. Around 40m of the addresses were Yahoo Mail, 33m Hotmail and 24m for Google\u2019s Gmail service. In this case, the hacker had been bragging on internet chat forums that he had a treasure trove of login credentials that he was trying to sell. Holden, who is fluent in Russian, said he wouldn\u2019t pay for the data but would give him \u201clikes\u201d on various social media posts in exchange. The hacker, who apparently is quite young, agreed. \u201cWe kind of call him the collector,\u201d Holden says in a heavy Russian accent. \u201cEventually, almost everyone gets breached.\u201d"
"9||J\u00fcrgen Klopp hopes Anfield aura can inspire Reds comeback against VillarrealJ\u00fcrgen Klopp described the win-win of a Europa League triumph and qualification for the Champions League as a dream that is close to becoming reality for Liverpool. The reality of a European semi-final at Anfield, he envisages and hopes, will be a nightmare for Villarreal. Behind in the tie, their season on the line, Liverpool know what lies in store at home on Thursday. Klopp suspects Villarreal do not. The Liverpool manager respects his disciplined, dangerous opponents but their reaction to Adri\u00e1n L\u00f3pez\u2019s 92nd-minute winner at El Madrigal last week \u2013 the coach, Marcelino, sprinting on to the pitch, the captain, Bruno Soriano, throwing his yellow shirt to the crowd \u2013 gave Klopp the impression Villarreal believe the hard work is done in their attempt to reach a first European final. Time has not softened his view. Klopp does not blame Marcelino for celebrating wildly \u2013 it would be a tad hypocritical if he did \u2013 but the Spanish club\u2019s satisfaction with a 1-0 advantage does not tally with his reading of the first leg. Asked whether Villarreal\u2019s jubilance showed they do not fully appreciate Anfield\u2019s reputation, Klopp said: \u201cYou are right, but I do not know what they know about Anfield. They scored in the last minute of the game to make it 1-0 and if you don\u2019t celebrate then there\u2019s something wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s more about what my colleague [Marcelino] said after the game \u2013 that 1-0 was the result he dreamed of. The way the game went is not what he expected. I don\u2019t think we are through, or halfway or that we are out of the tournament either. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I always from now on expect wonders from us or from the crowd in difficult, close games, but we have all felt how big the influence is of an outstanding atmosphere. In this week of wonderful weather on Merseyside, maybe the only good weather of the year, everybody could be in the perfect mood. Everything is like it should be.\u201d Like Borussia Dortmund before them, Villarreal prepared for a European date at Anfield by resting several key players for a derby. Unlike Dortmund\u2019s 2-2 draw at Schalke, however, a result that effectively ended their hopes of catching Bayern Munich and raised the stakes for their quarter-final, Marcelino\u2019s team achieved their objective of Champions League qualification with a 2-0 win at Valencia on Sunday. Samu Garc\u00eda and the match-winner from the first leg, L\u00f3pez, delivered victory in the absence of Bruno, the leading goalscorer C\u00e9dric Bakambu, Denis Su\u00e1rez, Victor Ruiz and Mario Gaspar. The central defender Eric Bailly also missed the win at the Mestalla with a groin problem sustained against Liverpool but has been declared fit for the second leg. Bailly has been an integral part of a defence with the third best record in La Liga this season \u2013 only Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Barcelona have conceded fewer goals than Villarreal\u2019s 31 \u2013 but frugality is also a feature of Marcelino\u2019s attack. The Yellow Submarine have secured fourth place and a Champions League ticket with a mere 44 goals scored. Real Madrid, one place above, have 105. Klopp\u2019s main concern is obvious, and may enhance Daniel Sturridge\u2019s prospects of starting a Europa League tie for the first time since Manchester United away in the last 16, but breaking a mean Villarreal defence will not be at the expense of ignoring their threat on the counter-attack once again. \u201cWe need to be clever and patient,\u201d said Dejan Lovren. \u201cAnd when you attack you also need to defend.\u201d The Liverpool manager, who has Emre Can available after a rapid recovery from an ankle ligament injury, added: \u201cAhead of this game maybe everybody expects us to be on fire from the first second and that we will press them in their own half. A lot of things are possible and I don\u2019t want to talk too much about what we do because hopefully we can surprise them, but it is about playing smart. A big threat is their counterattacking game. It is not their only strength, but it is a big part of their game. With these two strikers they are pretty quick and calm enough to wait for situations, they defend with eight people leaving these two strikers always in dangerous positions so you need a perfect protection for all your attacking moments. \u201cWe played well until a specific point in the first game and then with our crosses we didn\u2019t find the target often enough. What we have done until now was to be perfectly prepared for this game. Since 1.45pm on Sunday we only thought about this game. If we can create in this game a similar atmosphere as Dortmund then it will be much more difficult for Villarreal than they imagine in this moment.\u201d Another successful comeback will deliver a second final for Klopp in only seven months as Liverpool manager, leaving the team one win away from a return to the Champions League. The response to trailing 3-1 at home to Dortmund with 33 minutes remaining of the quarter-final, he insists, confirms Liverpool will be relentless in pursuit of that goal. \u201cForget everything that went before, don\u2019t think about after the game, just focus on the game and do whatever you can. Fight for your life\u201d is Klopp\u2019s instruction to his players. \u201cThat mood fits perfectly with this specific game. After the draw at Dortmund nobody really expected we would go through. Before the draw and then when people saw Dortmund they said: \u2018Oh my God.\u2019 People thought we would go out in the quarter-final but we showed it is possible. It is only an opportunity. A big opportunity. It is something like a dream. We want to make it true.\u201d"
"8||Junior doctors agree temporary halt to strikes in exchange for talksJunior doctors have agreed to temporarily hold off calling further strikes to enable fresh talks to take place with the government, giving hope that the long-running pay dispute could finally be heading towards resolution. The British Medical Association\u2019s renewed willingness to talk follows a plea from medical leaders for a five-day truce to allow the doctors\u2019 union and ministers to try to reach agreement on outstanding issues and so avoid further walkouts. The BMA\u2019s response to the initiative prompted cautious optimism, but it was still unclear whether the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, would give enough ground to allow negotiations to resume after a three-month break. Unless he does, further strikes look inevitable. The BMA\u2019s junior doctors committee is due to meet on Saturday to discuss ways of ramping up their campaign of industrial action against the new contract Hunt plans to force on them as part of his \u201cseven-day NHS\u201d plan. They are considering tactics including an indefinite all-out strike across all areas of care and a mass resignation of junior doctors. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has launched a new bid to break the deadlock in the eight month-long dispute. It is urging both sides to abandon their preconditions that are preventing fresh talks from taking place in order to avoid the row inflicting further damage on the NHS. If successful, it could lead to talks resuming for a defined period as early as next week, possibly overseen again by the independent Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas). \u201cA five-day pause without \u2018ifs, buts and maybes\u2019 and with both sides in the dispute publicly committing to a serious attempt to reach a resolution through genuine dialogue is obviously the only way out of this impasse,\u201d said Prof Dame Sue Bailey, the chair of the academy, which represents all of the UK\u2019s 250,000 doctors on professional matters. \u201cBefore either side does anything else, all the 22 medical royal colleges and faculties are unanimously calling on the secretary of state for health, Jeremy Hunt, and the chair of the BMA\u2019s junior doctors\u2019 committee, Dr Johann Malawana, to take a deep breath, dial down the rhetoric and get back to the table for talk facilitated, perhaps, by a senior independent figure\u201d. Prof Simon Wessely, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \u201cWe need both sides to put aside their anger, pride and personal emotions to help end what has become a classic Mexican standoff. You don\u2019t have to be Henry Kissinger to realise that we are in a desperate impasse. \u201cOne side is saying it won\u2019t talk unless the other removes the threat to impose the contract and the other says it won\u2019t lift that threat. Both sides should drop their preconditions immediately and start talking because it\u2019s those preconditions that preclude any form of negotiation.\u201d The BMA and ministers have not held formal talks since early February, when two months of negotiations \u2013 some with Acas \u2013 made progress but failed to resolve the key issue of the extra pay junior doctors would receive for working on Saturdays in hospitals across England as part of the introduction of a seven-day NHS. Malawana reacted to the academy\u2019s move by saying that: \u201cThe government itself has admitted that there are serious, outstanding issues with the proposed contract. As such, the BMA would be prepared to agree to this proposal and temporarily suspend industrial action so that talks can resume with a mutually agreed facilitator, if the government is also prepared to suspend the threat of imposition.\u201d The Department of Health has indicated its readiness to talk, but it has also refused to lift its threat of imposition. Hunt held informal talks with the BMA\u2019s leader, Dr Mark Porter, last Thursday, just after junior doctors staged their first-ever all-out strikes, about the possible outlines of a settlement to the long-running row. NHS and medical leaders are expected to urge Hunt on Thursday to go further in the hope of ending the hostilities. \u201cThe BMA directly caused the introduction of new contracts after we agreed to suspend imposition last November, because they went back on their word to talk about Saturday pay. It is now too late to change the process of bringing in contracts which is well underway throughout the country,\u201d said a Department of Health spokesman. \u201cHowever, the door remains open to talk about implementation and many other non-contractual issues of concern to junior doctors, so if this intervention helps those talks to go ahead, we welcome that.\u201d Both sides are keen to reach an agreed settlement somehow but two weeks ago Hunt initially considered a different idea \u2013 a cross-party plan to pilot the new contract before rolling it out across England \u2013 but then rejected it, apparently after discussing it with Downing Street. The NHS Confederation backed the move and said the hospital trusts it represents wanted the dispute sorted. \u201cWe welcome the academy\u2019s proposal to create a safe space for a conversation between the parties about how we find a way out of this dispute. Both sides should give serious consideration to an approach that would find support from across managerial and clinical leaders,\u201d said Rob Webster, its chief executive. \u201cOur members are all keen to see a swift resolution for the benefit of patients and staff, especially when the service is under such intense pressure.\u201d The General Medical Council, which regulates the medical profession, also threw its weight behind the plan. \u201cWe would support any initiative that sought to bring both sides together to resolve the issues before putting patients at further risk of harm,\u201d said Professor Terence Stephenson, its chair."
"14||Do we have to rebrand the arts as 'creative tech' for Turnbull to give us money?Ray Huang\u2019s book on the decline of the Ming dynasty focused on a year when nothing much happened. 1587 was A Year of No Significance \u2013 pretty much a non-year \u2013 but beneath the surface, signs of deep tectonic shifts could be found, ones that would lead to the dynasty\u2019s collapse. Nothing much happened in this budget either; it was pretty much a non-budget. The arts press has identified snips here and there but the damage was done in the previous two years, with about $42m each year chopped from the Australia Council. This sat alongside cuts to Screen Australia, and the ongoing diminishing of the public broadcasting system. This is the year the culture cuts didn\u2019t happen, in a budget of no significance \u2013 other than as an election spruik. Yet look carefully and you can see the cracks. Let us leave aside \u201cjobs and growth\u201d (now there\u2019s a surprise) and look at those ideas of innovation and transition, agility and enterprise that are to set us on course, belatedly, for the 21st century. Arts and culture are absent. So too are those \u201ccreative industries\u201d which, we have been told for nearly two decades, are the growth and jobs sector of the future. STEM refuses to turn into STEAM. Education \u2013 creative or otherwise \u2013 remains in the \u201cto cut\u201d basket. Whatever bright future lies ahead, \u201cculture and creativity\u201d are not, as far as this government is concerned, central to it. This has come as a shock to those in the arts and culture sector who, since Paul Keating\u2019s Creative Nation document of 1994, looked to the new information economy to change them from welfare recipients into investment opportunities. Information-rich economies were turning culture and creativity into the iron and coal of the 21st century. The cultural sector was the fastest growing. Those who worked in it, we were told, possessed a pure form of creativity that could catalyse the rest of the economy. The arts were the jewel in the crown of a cultural tourism sector that was displacing beaches and barbeques in a globally imagined Australia. Much of this was undoubtedly true. Which is why there has been universal head scratching as to why an industry that employs more than agriculture and construction \u2013 and that repeatedly over-performs on value-for-money, return on investment, and the rest \u2013 is so utterly ignored by government. And not just the Coalition. The Victorian government\u2019s announcement of a coherent, well-funded strategy for culture shines out across a sea of gloom, when in fact (without sounding churlish) it should be par for the course. Perhaps we have not nailed down the impact metrics? Maybe we have used soft cultural consultants, when we should have gone to Goldman Sachs? Maybe we should rebrand the cultural sector as \u201ccreative tech\u201d? The problem lies deeper than finding the right metric. It can be glimpsed in one of those \u201cbeware geeks\u201d sections of the budget, hiding a 25% cut in the cost of access to the public broadcast spectrum. As David Tilly put it: \u201cSavaged by poverty, desperate for any relief, the Australian free-to-air commercial broadcasters will pay even less for their licence to use the spectrum so inconveniently owned by the people of Australia\u201d. This reduction of $160m to the public purse will undoubtedly be born by the ABC and SBS. More head scratching, and of the sort common in the UK where the BBC is being similarly savaged. Why would a government systematically debilitate a highly successful and popular public broadcaster? The answer lies in the word \u201cpublic\u201d. For it is a truth universally acknowledged that the market is the best and only source of value; and if it is not, then that\u2019s because it is being distorted by the public sector. In part this is related to the kinds of constituencies represented by the current government, for whom anything public is a restriction on their profits. But that is not all of it. The reason why art and culture \u2013 including the media \u2013 are left out is not because they have failed to make the economic case for culture, but because they still hold on to values which cannot be encapsulated by economic reason alone. They stand, fundamentally, for values of individual and collective wellbeing and development, which are at odds with the dominant values of current economic reasoning: that only market transactions can hold a society together and provide for their collective wellbeing; and that cultural consumption must be organised and judged as all other kinds of consumption are \u2013 the economically efficient delivery of ever-proliferating goods and services to an infinitely expandable set of wants, whose merit (other than pornography, defamation and terrorism) is a question only for the consumer and his or her credit card. This is the bind that a budget of no importance reveals to the arts and culture sector. Government does not have a place for the kinds of value you bring. Two decades of trying to show that really, our value is your value have come to nothing. This sounds gloomy, but does not need to be. Because increasingly, the value that the cultural sector represents \u2013 a truthful account of individual change and becoming, a celebration and enhancement of collective belonging \u2013 is exactly what is lacking in the utterly degraded wasteland of \u201cjobs and growth\u201d. The cultural sector has been through a lot in the past 20 years. Maybe it has grown up, become more responsible, less precious. But the values it represents are needed now more than ever, much more than impact statements that no minister ever reads. Times are going to be hard for those who make a living in culture, but please: don\u2019t give up your day job. \u2022 Justin O\u2019Connor\u2019s Platform Paper \u2013 After the Creative Industries: Why We Need a Cultural Economy \u2013 is published this week by Currency House"
"9||Madrid given another derby day as Real match Atl\u00e9tico in Champions LeagueThe night before had been Neptune\u2019s, now it was Cibeles\u2019s turn. Madrid\u2019s clubs will have their day; they also have their deities, and not only Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez, Antoine Griezmann and Gareth Bale, the men whose goals mean that they will meet again. Another night, another party, in honour of a second European Cup final in two years. From Lisbon 2014 to Milan 2016. \u201cReal Madrid\u2019s fans love the Champions League,\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo said; \u201cIt was beautiful to suffer,\u201d Fernando Torres said. For this reward, it was, too \u2013 but better still to celebrate. Soon after the final whistle in Munich on Tuesday night, Atl\u00e9tico fans began arriving at the statute of Neptune, the god of the sea with whom they have been spending rather a lot of time of late. Even before the first whistle here, 500 yards up the Paseo del Prado, they were preparing for Real\u2019s fans to emulate them. As Manchester City\u2019s supporters gathered in Plaza Mayor, council workers surrounded Cibeles, goddess of fertility, with protective barriers. It was as if they knew; Madrid played as if they knew, too. So, it sometimes felt, did City. Never did the rebel against this goddess\u2019s will. The party was prepared; at 10.45pm it began. Madrid had accelerated during the second half, getting closer to the goal and, just as importantly, getting closer to the full-time whistle. One goal was enough for Madrid; one would have been enough for City but they could not react. By the end they had never threatened, so much so that it was as if they were not even trying to, not producing a single shot on target. It may not have been perfect football but Madrid did enough and when the final-whistle Bad Moon Rising boomed out and the players lined up to applaud their fans, supporters resisted leaving but eventually headed down the Castellana, singing. If there is something about Atl\u00e9tico under Diego Simeone, there is also something about Real Madrid and this competition, something about these nights that is so different from games held on any given Sunday. It is the European Cup that made them, an identity forged in winning the first five trophies. Over 32 years they waited for their seventh; for 12 years winning the d\u00e9cima, their 10th, was an obsession that ate away at them. They ended that wait two years ago; now they are there again. \u201cWhat a way to suffer!\u201d lauds Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s centenary anthem, sung by the gravelly-voiced folk singer Joaqu\u00edn Sabina. Madrid\u2019s anthem calls on a \u201cfield of stars\u201d, an operatic march sung by Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. Maybe there is something in that. Real\u2019s road to Milan has proven a little less winding than Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s. Frankly, it was easier, City included. It will trouble Manuel Pellegrini how easy it was. Yes, Pep Guardiola was defeated in the semi-final too, but this was simply not the same. There was nothing heroic in this defeat, no glory in how they fell. As for Real, the glory was in getting there more than how they got there. Simeone\u2019s side defeated PSV on penalties and got past Barcelona and Bayern, resisting. Madrid defeated Roma, Wolfsburg and now Manchester City. They needed a comeback against the Germans, winning 3-0 here having lost 2-0 away, Ronaldo scoring a superb hat-trick, but there was little epic really. When they got there it was an own goal that opened the way. That was what Uefa said anyway. Bale may disagree, not keen to be denied his first goal of this season\u2019s competition. At 1-0, at the mercy of an away goal, comfort can never be complete but Madrid were superior here and knew it, but they did not always sparkle. In truth, they rarely have in this competition this season. Nor, though, despite Zinedine Zidane\u2019s warning, did they \u201csuffer\u201d. And, four months to the day since he took over, he is in his first European Cup final as a coach. Here was another special night, a special day. Supporters waited at the Plaza de las Sagradas Corazones for the team bus. When it reversed into the Bernab\u00e9u, the back appeared to be burnt. It had edged its way there along Concha Espina amid fireworks and fans, thousands of them. On the metro, a sing-off began, palms thumping the ceiling, carriage bouncing: Blue Moon versus Como no te va a querer? \u201cHow could I not love you,\u201d the lyrics run, \u201cwhen you won the European Cup for a 10th time?\u201d It won\u2019t scan quite so well with 11 but they won\u2019t care. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s fans would love their team to get one; they would love them if they got none. \u201cTe Amo,\u201d I love you, ran the mosaic before the first leg of their semi-final against Bayern. Madrid raised one of their own here: 78,000 pieces of folded-up coloured card, with handy instructions on the back. \u201cTogether, nothing is impossible,\u201d it declared. Beating City certainly was not. \u201cMake it Real,\u201d it urged, pun intended. They did. It always felt as if they would. When Bale\u2019s first-half cross deflected in off Fernando, Madrid had the goal they needed. City still needed only one, too, but Keylor Navas was a spectator. Rarely did they really look like getting the goal, not even when Kevin De Bruyne hit the side-netting in the final 10 minutes, although when Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s shot hit the top of the net in the 88th minute there were nerves and a moment later Navas had to come out to head clear, a little uneasily. City did not even have the desperation that might have driven them. Navas had spent the second half watching the white shirts rolling forward, attacking with increasing insistence if not often with clear ideas. Or, if not, stepping out to intercept easily, led by Sergio Ramos. If Madrid might have been tempted to defend, instead they attacked. It did not often expose them; it just exposed how much better they are. Luka Modric and Ronaldo might both have got the second goal, only for Joe Hart to stop them both. Then Bale headed against a post and when the cross came back in, Ronaldo could not quite reach it on the line, leaping to slap it in with his hands. City\u2019s fans boomed out Blue Moon but they were standing alone. \u201cHow could I not love you?\u201d ran round again. \u201cMadrid! Madrid!\u201d the Bernab\u00e9u chanted, the city that has two teams in the final, and where for the second night running a party was about to get under way. Milan awaits. So, like Neptune the night before, did Cibeles."
"9||Timid Manchester City suffer as Real Madrid reach final thanks to own goalPerhaps the most harrowing part for Manchester City amid all the regrets and raw disappointment is the way large parts of this game seemed to pass them by. Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team came up short in most areas but it was their lack of punch, their blandness in attack and the way that key players failed them on the big occasion that were the most startling. There is no shame to lose to Real Madrid and, ultimately, it was a goal of considerable fortune, deflected into his own net by Fernando, that means San Siro will be full of Madridistas on 28 May. Yet City should not push the hard-luck line too much when they could not even muster a shot on target. They managed only one in the first leg, a 91st-minute free-kick, and it was perplexing to see a team normally renowned for attacking flair opting for the pea-shooter as their form of artillery. Pellegrini argued afterwards that his team had not deserved to lose but they certainly did not do enough to win on a strangely subdued night for Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Kevin De Bruyne and their other attacking players. Ag\u00fcero did not manage a single shot on target for the fifth Champions League tie in a row. Yaya Tour\u00e9 had the excuse that he was not fully fit, lasting only an hour, but nobody should be too surprised by the inability of Jes\u00fas Navas to leave a favourable impression on a big match. The late onslaught from Pellegrini\u2019s team that might have been anticipated never materialised and, however much their departing manager tried to dress it up, the harsh reality was that City left the party in a way that should never be regarded as satisfactory, quietly closing the door behind themselves. Instead Milan can brace itself for an all-Madrid final, just as it was at Lisbon in 2014, and it was an awkward moment afterwards when Pellegrini said he did not believe that Zinedine Zidane\u2019s team had accumulated 15 attempts at goal, even though it was on the official Uefa statistics sheet and did not seem unreasonable in the slightest. For City, there was the moment towards the end of the first half when Fernandinho\u2019s shot skimmed off a post and, late on, a long-range shot from Ag\u00fcero that landed on the roof of the net. Those apart, however, the most expensively assembled team in English football rarely attacked with real conviction. Nor could it be said they had lost to one of the more formidable Real teams. Luka Modric was outstanding in the home side\u2019s midfield but Cristiano Ronaldo did not look entirely recovered from a hamstring injury. Zidane\u2019s side are certainly not as devastating as the days when he was in the team rather than on the touchline, but City reacted badly to losing Vincent Kompany to his unending injury issues and it took them far too long to shake their heads clear. The giant banner unveiled before kickoff on the fondo sur, where Madrid\u2019s most boisterous fans congregate, read: \u201cJuntos No Hay Imposibles\u201d (translation: \u201cTogether Nothing is Impossible\u201d). Pellegrini had said something similar beforehand about his own team but what he had not anticipated was that Kompany\u2019s involvement would last only 10 minutes. Kompany is a fine captain \u2013 at least when his body allows \u2013 but his injuries are becoming as synonymous with the modern-day City as inflatable bananas were with the old one. In total, there have been 33 in his seven and a half years at City and the latest one came with the worst timing of all. All the same, it was strange to see the way City allowed that early setback to disrupt their rhythm. They were punished in the 20th minute when Dani Carvajal advanced from his full-back position and Gareth Bale was in space, waiting for the pass. Cutting in from the right, Bale\u2019s intention was to clip a cross to the far post but the ball took a nick off Fernando and that deflection was decisive. The ball flicked over Hart, spinning beneath the point of crossbar and post, and though Bale was announced as the scorer Uefa later ruled it should be classified as an own goal. It was desperately unlucky for City but, equally, Pellegrini must have been startled by his team\u2019s attempts to rescue themselves. An away goal would have dramatically changed the complexion of the night and as long as that was possible, that knowledge was never far from the minds of the home crowd. Yet there was never a period of the game when City put their hosts under sustained pressure. David Silva\u2019s absence always affects the team\u2019s cohesion but De Bruyne ought to have done more to make up for the Spaniard\u2019s absence. Navas was always on the edges of the game \u2013 a place he has come to know far too well \u2013 while Tour\u00e9 was off the pace during his hour on the pitch. Afterwards, a Spanish journalist asked Zidane if he agreed that Tour\u00e9 had looked as old as his shirt number \u2013 42 Modric had a chance to make it 2-0 early in the second half but, perhaps suspecting he was offside, could not apply the necessary finish. Joe Hart kept out Ronaldo with a couple of saves and Bale turned a header against a post from a second-half corner. Pellegrini brought on Raheem Sterling and Kelechi Iheanacho but the game drifted to its finale without any real sense that City might conjure up some late drama."
"13||Indigenous groups disappointed in budget with 'little to offer'Members and supporters of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and service sector have again expressed their disappointment in a federal budget which saw very little sent their way. The budget, delivered on Tuesday by Scott Morrison, had little to offer to Indigenous Australians as a separate group. The government will loan $65m to the Indigenous Land Corporation, to help it out of debt after a widely criticised purchase of the Ayers Rock Resort for more than it was worth. \u201cThe government\u2019s loan will un-encumber the ILC from the crippling impact of an existing debt that is diverting resources from its core business of supporting the economic aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians,\u201d said Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion, who added the resort had become an \u201cincubator\u201d of Indigenous employment. A further $23m will be reallocated for 12 months from Indigenous Business Australia to the Indigenous Advancement Strategy for entrepreneurial projects. The IAS is the policy which sought to streamline Indigenous funding by reallocating it through five key channels but a confusing process saw a massive oversubscription for the funds \u2013 reduced by more than $500m in the 2014 budget. The Recognise campaign and the prime minister\u2019s Referendum council received $15m for work towards constitutional recognition. And a $10.5m health boost was announced to provide more services for foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which disproportionately affects Indigenous people. A previously announced funding boost went to the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. The Labor senator Nova Peris welcomed the increased funding to Recognise and the council but said the budget otherwise lacked foresight and leadership. \u201cThe extreme cuts to IAS programs from the 2014 budget haven\u2019t been reversed, and there is a lack of any pivotal expenditure that may result in a new direction for Aboriginal people,\u201d she said. \u201cThe $152m cut to the higher education participation and partnerships program is also worrying, given the program does great work [with] disadvantaged students.\u201d Peris said a $4.5m cut to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal services from July 2017 \u2013 about 6% \u2013 was concerning. \u201cThe Law Council of Australia has already described the current legal aid situation as a \u2018funding crisis\u2019 and this multimillion-dollar cut threatens to worsen the high levels of Aboriginal incarceration,\u201d she said. Hewitt Whyman, chair of the Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT) said he was optimistic the attorney general, George Brandis, would fix what he hoped was a \u201cslip of the pen\u201d. Gary Oliver, the organisation\u2019s chief executive, said he estimated the cut would see about 4,800 Aboriginal adults and children miss out on legal assistance in one year. He pointed to the high rates of Indigenous youth incarceration and said Australia had a \u201cdubious\u201d reputation for locking up children: \u201cOur legal services can barely keep up with states and territory police rates of arrest now, over the most minor of offences. What will it be like with funding cuts and less frontline staff? \u201cThe significant drop in funding we\u2019re facing next year will mean Australia\u2019s most poorest [sic], more disadvantaged, and most needy, will have to renege their right to natural justice before the courts.\u201d Oxfam Australia\u2019s chief executive, Dr Helen Szoke, said Turnbull\u2019s Closing the Gap speech this year was a \u201crhetorical flourish\u201d, and the government had failed its first opportunity to restore the 2014 cuts. \u201cAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people still represent a quarter of the prison population and are 10 times more likely to be removed from their families,\u201d Szoke said. \u201cAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the solutions but they need the funding to implement those solutions.\u201d The Country Needs People campaign had advocated for months for the government to boost the support of Indigenous ranger programs, and Indigenous protected areas. They had pointed to the prime minister\u2019s Closing the Gap address in which he told the Indigenous community to tell the government if a policy or program was successful. Rangers and IPAs have long been considered one of the great successes in Indigenous affairs, but no extra funding was announced. They are now funded to 2018 but that campaign had called for a doubling of ranger positions and a 10-year guarantee. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said the budget had been \u201cunderwhelming\u201d. \u201cIt is disappointing to see that despite the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and the Greens calling for an increase in funding and longevity for Indigenous rangers, the government hasn\u2019t increased support for the program,\u201d she said. The opposition spokesman for Indigenous Affairs, Shayne Neumann, said the government had \u201cno vision, no focus and no priorities\u201d for Indigenous Australians, and had locked in the same cuts from previous years."
"9||Vincent Kompany injury again highlights Manchester City\u2019s damning weaknessThere was a brave wave, a sad trudge off, and now for Vincent Kompany in the coming days surely more soul-searching as Manchester City\u2019s captain contemplates the 33rd injury in his eight years at the club. Manuel Pellegrini had stated before this Champions League semi-final second leg that City\u2019s best opportunity was to \u201cplay well in defence\u201d, then he watched dismayed as Kompany hobbled off 10 minutes in with what appeared to be a quad problem. This meant the leader of the rearguard \u2013 and the side \u2013 was again a helpless onlooker, and it now fell to Eliaquim Mangala to partner Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi at centre-back. This was the pairing at the heart of a defence that shipped four goals in Sunday\u2019s defeat at Southampton. Mangala was one of three players from that unit dropped for this evening. Aleksandar Kolarov and Pablo Zabaleta also made way for Ga\u00ebl Clichy and Bacary Sagna at left- and right-back respectively, so as the Frenchman replaced Kompany the test was whether the disrupted defence would be able to repel Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u with the tie poised at 0-0. The first answer came around 10 minutes after Kompany was forced off, as Gareth Bale ran at Joe Hart from the right and conjured an opener that beat the City goalkeeper via a deflection that pinballed in off his right-hand post. At this juncture Real were running riot and Pellegrini\u2019s faith in Kompany as the back four\u2019s bedrock appeared a gamble that had misfired at the worst possible time. This reliance on the Belgian is a prime head-scratcher for the incoming Pep Guardiola. The Spaniard officially takes over on 1 July but he is already plotting how to take City on to the next level. After his Bayern Munich side were eliminated by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in Tuesday\u2019s first semi-final, Guardiola will have watched this encounter and had his concerns over Kompany\u2019s robustness confirmed. Guardiola has to wonder if he can really afford to rely on a 30-year-old whose previous injuries have already cost him 18 weeks of this season, and which up to Wednesday night\u2019s sad end have allowed him to appear in only 21 of City\u2019s 57 matches. City have already spent \u00a374m in transfer fees alone trying to answer the Kompany question. This is the outlay for Mangala (\u00a342m) and Otamendi (\u00a332m) but the best to be said about either is each is a far better footballer when Kompany operates alongside them. City are determined to give Kompany one more year to finally rid himself of his injury plague. The reason is simple: the side are a tougher proposition when he is in it. Yet this \u201cwhen\u201d becomes more and more an \u201cif\u201d due to the physical problems that have denied the Belgian a serious run in the XI. The firm interest in signing Athletic Bilbao\u2019s Aymeric Laporte for a reported \u00a339.6m release-clause fee is an attempt to finally free them of the problem. The Frenchman is expected to be out until August due to a broken leg and dislocated ankle, however. On the one hand this shows how highly Laporte is thought of by Guardiola and Txiki Begiristain, the sporting director who signs off transfers. But on the other, given that any player who returns from serious injury can never be absolutely sure how he might recover, it seems yet another throw of the dice at centre-back when really what is needed is the acquisition of a banker of a performer. Yet given the manner of Kompany\u2019s early withdrawal City could be proud at half-time to still be within 45 minutes of the European Cup final. The scoreline remained 1-0 to Zinedine Zidane\u2019s team so the equation was the same as at the kick-off: a sole goal would take Pellegrini\u2019s side to the Milan showpiece this month due to the away goals rule. The concern was that every time Real went at the City backline holes would appear. Not 10 minutes had been played after the interval when Luka Modric found himself in, alone on goal, before Hart. The Croatian should have doubled his team\u2019s lead but fluffed the chance, and City\u2019s No1 did the rest. Earlier, Pellegrini had also said: \u201cIt is important to realise that it is not easy to get to a semi-final. First you must be in the top four in your league, which is not easy in England. Then it is very difficult to continue after the group stage, the round of 16, the quarter-final. So we must play and fight for every ball to win the game and take our chance to reach the final. \u201cWe will see if Yaya Tour\u00e9 is able to complete 90 minutes, but his experience in this game is very important.\u201d By the hour the anonymous Ivorian had been replaced by Raheem Sterling. And as the contest entered its final 15 minutes City still required a goal. Either from the kind of trickery the England forward can provide, or anywhere else. On returning from injury No32, a knee problem that kept him out between 15 March and 19 April, Kompany had spoken of \u201c14 comebacks\u201d. The idea there was to stress the positive. It is an admirable approach but he now faces another challenge of will and spirit. For Manchester City there is a more fundamental issue to contemplate: can Kompany really be the linchpin of the team in the new Guardiola era?"
"9||Real Madrid 1-0  Manchester City (agg 1-0): Champions League semi-final \u2013 as it happenedBut it matters not! City can\u2019t get back upfield again, and the referee blows his whistle! Real Madrid have made their 14th European Cup final! They\u2019ll face their city rivals Atletico in Milan later this month, a repeat of the 2014 final. You can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t deserve it tonight: they carried the greater attacking threat, and on another day would have scored a couple more. City by comparison didn\u2019t get a single effort on target. On the other hand, it took a deflected goal to beat them, they hung in there, refusing to buckle under pressure, and Sergio Aguero very nearly silenced the Bernabeu with a stunning effort during the game\u2019s last knockings. But on the whole City didn\u2019t do enough. Ah well, they\u2019re making incremental progress, and there\u2019s always next year. A good night for Pep Guardiola, if nothing else. 90 min +5: A ball looped forward into the City box. James is free! But with only Hart to beat, he falls backwards and can\u2019t connect with the ball. City escape! 90 min +4: Sterling tries to send Iheanacho into space down the right, but the young striker is crowded out. Real go back upfield and stroke it around awhile. 90 min +3: Otamendi is booked for a high boot on Ronaldo. The clock keeps ticking. 90 min +2: The assistant ref holds up four minutes. The first two are spent rubbing Keylor Navas\u2019s leg; he\u2019s down having picked up an injury while making that clearance. There will be more than four extra minutes, I\u2019ll be bound. 90 min: Aguero has been quiet tonight, but suddenly he\u2019s come alive. Perhaps too late. He chases a long ball down the left. Pepe misreads the bounce on the edge of the box, forcing his keeper to come out and batter the ball into the stand. 89 min: The Bernabeu falls silent for a couple of seconds as Aguero, in a little space down the inside-left channel, lashes a screaming dipper up and down towards the top right. He\u2019s got Keylor Navas beaten, but the ball whistles inches over the bar and onto the top netting. The City fans celebrate, before swallowing their cheers. Real fans are too shocked to respond. For a moment, an eerie quiet descended on the Bernabeu. City so close to a spectacular goal, so close to the final! 88 min: Modric is replaced by Kovacic. He takes a full minute to get off the pitch, professional time management at its very best. 86 min: Bale is blocked fairly obviously by Otamendi as he bombs down the left. The referee, perhaps wondering whether he should even the decisions up a little bit, doesn\u2019t give the free kick. The home fans, plus Zinedine Zidane on the touchline, aren\u2019t best impressed. 84 min: De Bruyne takes the free kick. It\u2019s practically a corner, so why he tries to catch Keylor Navas out at his near post is anyone\u2019s guess. His effort to curl it directly into the bottom left would have been parried clear had it been on target, which it wasn\u2019t, the side netting rippling harmlessly. A waste of a good chance. Real should be down to ten for the remainder, mind. 83 min: Sterling dribbles along an intricate route down the left. Near the corner flag, Lucas Vazquez slides in and upends his man. Yellow, but that should have been a straight red card: the Real man was out of control and planted his studs on Sterling\u2019s shin. A potential leg-breaker. Thankfully Sterling will be OK. 82 min: It\u2019s Sterling versus Carvajal again. This time he earns a yard, and has a chance to loop a cross into the centre. But there\u2019s nobody other than Iheanacho in the middle. Real are sitting back, inviting pressure, but City haven\u2019t responded to the come-on yet. They need to start throwing men forward. 80 min: Another skitter for Sterling down the left. For a second it looks as though he\u2019s got the legs to beat Carvajal, but heads down a blind alley and the chance to cross is gone. 77 min: Lucas Vazquez dances down the right. His shot isn\u2019t up to much. Meanwhile Fernandinho slides in on Kroos, who doesn\u2019t like the challenge. The pair rub eyebrows in the muscular style. The referee gives both of them a bollocking, nothing more. Given that he\u2019d initially misidentified Fernandinho for De Bruyne, he probably wasn\u2019t arguing from a position of absolute authority. 76 min: Aguero bursts down the inside-left channel and looks to have been checked by Ramos, but he\u2019s not getting the free kick. City are beginning to edge forward a little bit. Real have had all the chances, but this is still on a knife-edge. 75 min: Quite a few whistles ping around the Bernabeu as City stroke it around the middle while Real sit deep, making sure to keep a hold of what they\u2019ve got. It looks like they might have started to think about how close they are to the final, which would be good news for City. The away fans singing Blue Moon again. Nerves pinging around the famous old stadium. 73 min: A lull, which serves Real quite well. The clock is not City\u2019s friend. 71 min: Fernando is booked for a fairly cynical shove in Modric\u2019s back, as the Real playmaker dribbles through the centre circle. He doesn\u2019t bother arguing the toss. 70 min: A little space for Sterling out on the left. He dribbles with pace and purpose towards the Real box, before fizzing low into the middle, where Aguero waits to shoot. Ramos slides in to put a stop to City\u2019s plans. But that is a little better from City, who still just need the one goal. Might all those missed chances start playing on Madrid minds? 69 min: The thoroughly ineffectual Jesus Navas is replaced by the excellent Kelechi Iheanacho. Here\u2019s Kevin Wilson: \u201cFilm nerd comment (but slightly football related), but Silvana Mangano was married to Dino Di Laurentiis, film producer and uncle of the former Napoli chairman. You could do worse than watch Pasolini\u2019s Teorema, where she plays the mother of a bourgeois family whose existence is unsettled by Terence Stamp\u2019s Angel/Devil drifter.\u201d 67 min: Real make their second chance of the evening, swapping Isco for the 2014 World Cup golden-boot winner James Rodriguez. 66 min: How are City still in this? But they\u2019re still in it! 64 min: The corner\u2019s whipped into the box. Bale rises, 12 yards out, and plants a header towards the top right. He\u2019s so unlucky: the header twangs off the underside of the bar and out! Lucas Vazquez tries to keep the move alive by chipping back into the centre from the right. Ronaldo is free, six yards out, and catches the ball with both hands before spiking it down and over the line! It\u2019s the height of absurdity, but he\u2019s not booked for his cheek because he was miles offside anyway. A cheeky wink to the referee, and we move on. 63 min: Ronaldo picks up a loose ball, 25 yards from goal. He drops a shoulder to move to the right of the D. His shot takes a walloping deflection off Clichy, looping over a stranded Hart and just wide left of the unguarded goal. Corner. From which... 61 min: Yaya Toure, who has been invisible tonight, is replaced by Raheem Sterling. He\u2019s got a habit of showing in big games, has Sterling: City need him to do that again tonight. 59 min: Lucas Vazquez slides a ball down City\u2019s always-wide-open inside-right channel. Ronaldo opens his legs and, from the edge of the box, slaps a low and hard effort towards the bottom right. Hart smothers brilliantly. City are under all sorts of pressure here. Their best bet? Hang on, hang on, hang on, and hope Real begin to get nervous as they get ever closer towards the final with just a one-goal lead to hang onto. 58 min: Ronaldo slips into Stepover Mode again. He tears down the right and zips a low ball into the centre towards Bale, but Otamendi is on hand to hook clear. 56 min: Lucas Vasquez comes on for Jese. \u201cAm I the only person who found that Silvana Mangano clip deeply weird?\u201d wonders Marie Meyer. \u201cMakes me wonder how future generations will view Single Ladies.\u201d 55 min: City\u2019s defence has, to a man, fallen asleep. Carvajal races after a long ball down the right. He loops a cross into the centre for Ronaldo. It\u2019s a bit high, but Ronaldo still gets his head on it, sending the ball straight at Hart. City are very much second best at the moment, but they\u2019re still just the one goal behind. And it only takes a minute. 53 min: How on earth are Real not two goals up? Bale drops deep down the right before chipping a delicious reverse pass down the channel to release Modric into the box. He\u2019s one on one with Hart! He has to score, but allows an over-elaborate dink towards the top right to be smothered by the star-jumping keeper. What a miss! What a save! What a non-event the resulting corner turns out to be! 51 min: Half-chances at either end. First De Bruyne, just inside the Real box, takes an airshot at a ball sent down the right by Sagna. Then Jese powers down the right, tearing past Mangala, only to blooter miles over the bar when he reaches the edge of the City area. 50 min: Bale, deep on the right wing, launches a long, drooping, diagonal pass towards Ronaldo, who has broken clear down the middle. He connects with a volley on the left-hand edge of the City D, but not particularly well, and the ball harmlessly bobbles through to Hart. A better connection, though, and City were in a lot of spectacular trouble. 48 min: Real have come out with a view to putting this tie to bed quickly. Jese skips past Otamendi down the left and romps into a lot of space. His low cross is easily gathered by Hart at his near post. Jese should have done a lot better. 46 min: Hoo, City so nearly concede within 30 seconds of the restart. Kroos rakes a glorious diagonal pass to release Carvajal on the right. He hits a low, first-time ball into the six-yard box. Otamendi slides in to block, with Ronaldo waiting to sidefoot home in the simple style. As it turns out, the flag goes up for offside - both Carvajal and Ronaldo were ahead of the City back line - but that was close. The visitors have been woozy all night; they need to snap out of it quickly. So this is where we are: City were second best in the first half, doing quite a lot of wandering about, and yet they\u2019re far from out of this. They just need a goal. They\u2019ll go through on the away goals rule if this ends a score draw. But another Real goal will surely bury them. Just to clarify the Bale/Fernando goal/own goal situation: Bale certainly looked up as if to cross, and his hard cross-cum-shot took a deflection off the sliding defender to whip along an absurdly oscillating arc across the goal and into the top left. Fine margins, though. Does that clarify it? Hmm. Anyway, Real get the ball rolling for the second half. Half-time entertainment: For those who enjoy a bit of history, here\u2019s footage of Manchester City\u2019s not-quite-epochal defeat by Fenerbah\u00e7e in 1968. It\u2019s soundtracked to a version of El Negro Zumb\u00f3n, which is a nice melodic touch. But if events from 1968 are still too raw, here\u2019s El Negro Zumb\u00f3n being performed by Silvana Mangano in the 1951 Italian classic Anna. A couple of added minutes and time for one last corner. It\u2019s Real\u2019s, out on the right. Ramos tries to get a head on it, but can\u2019t, not quite. And that\u2019s that for the first half. The goal that separates the sides has been taken off Bale by Uefa and credited to poor Fernando; turns out that deflection might not have been quite so slight after all. But this is mere admin: City have to find a second-half goal if they\u2019re to keep their hopes of reaching a first Champions League final alive. It\u2019ll be tense. No flipping! 44 min: De Bruyne turns down the middle of the park and slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Fernandinho, who cuts in from the flank and lashes a low shot inches wide of the left-hand post from the edge of the box. That\u2019s the nearest City have come, and their best move too. Simple but highly effective. 43 min: Bale drops a shoulder to earn himself a little pocket to the left of the City D. He has a shot but a fairly lame effort bumps harmlessly towards Hart. 42 min: Clichy goes on a baroque scamper down the left, and for a second looks like working a bit of space in the Real box. But he seems to lose heart and confidence mid-run, and checks back. The momentum is lost. 41 min: It\u2019s not as though City aren\u2019t doing their damndest to get back into this game. They earn themselves another corner, this time out on the left, but De Bruyne loops a fairly harmless set piece up, down and into the grateful arms of Keylor Navas. 40 min: And there\u2019s more space for Marcelo down the left, sent clear into the City box but stopped in full flight by the flag of the linesman. An incorrect offside decision that dug City out of a hole. 38 min: City are living dangerously. Modric sprays a glorious pass down the left to release Marcelo, who flashes a high ball across the face of goal. Fortunately for City, there\u2019s nobody in white to knock the ball past a flapping Hart. 36 min: Kroos whips the free kick to the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Pepe tries to meet the dropping ball with a volley, but can\u2019t connect. No matter, for Ramos is on hand to tuck the loose ball underneath Hart and into the net. But it won\u2019t count! There were four Real players offside when the free kick was sent in; Pepe and Ramos were two of them. City breathe again. 35 min: Bale very nearly bursts into an awful lot of space down the right, but opts for a pass inside towards Jese instead. His rangefinder is wonky. In the resulting breakdown, Kroos is shouldercharged in the chest, in a fairly industrial fashion, by Fernandinho, who is lucky to avoid a booking. A free kick, 35 yards out on the right. From which... 33 min: A low ball into the Real box from the right nearly finds Aguero on the edge of the six-yard box, but Carvajal slides in to deflect the ball past the right-hand post. A corner, which leads to a light game of head tennis, one ended by Keylor Navas charging off his line and claiming possession. 32 min: Aguero looks to pass Ramos down the middle. He\u2019s stopped by the defender hanging out an arm and catching his eye. The referee deems it accidental. \u201cWhen you said in the preamble that Yaya Toure would be \u2018refreshed\u2019, did you mean \u2018half-drunk\u2019?\u201d wonders Adam Hirst. \u201cHis aimless slow wanderings around the centre circle at half the pace of the match seem to indicate that.\u201d 30 min: De Bruyne is booked for a fairly average clip on the back of Marcelo\u2019s heel, as the pair compete down the City right. I suppose by the letter of the law that\u2019s a correct decision, but it seems pretty unnecessary: it was a clumsy forward\u2019s challenge, no more, no less. 28 min: Real pass time with some more of that gentle midfield possession. Pass, pass, passity, pass. City can\u2019t get a sniff of the ball at the moment. Here\u2019s Shaun Wilkinson: \u201cI feel like a terrible human being for even asking this, as he has been such a fantastic defender and seems like a great bloke, but at what point do City say enough is enough with Kompany? Much as I would love to be wrong, this pattern of missing a large amount of games, then playing a couple before getting hurt again seems to be pretty established now.\u201d 26 min: Ronaldo goes into stepover mode down the left, and purchases one free kick off Sagna. He takes the set piece, near the corner flag, himself. Hart punches clear with Ramos lurking in an offside position. 24 min: De Bruyne makes a little ground down the right but isn\u2019t able to bother Navas in the Real goal. City clearly aren\u2019t of a mind to die wondering; they\u2019ve looked more dangerous since going behind. 23 min: City need a goal now, but they can\u2019t afford to go too gung-ho. Marcelo and Isco combine down the left to set up Ronaldo, whose first-time shot from the edge of the area is high and wide. 21 min: City try to respond immediately, Navas earning a corner down the right. From the set piece, Fernando rises 12 yards out and thumps a header over the bar. That was quite a chance to equalise - and effectively take the lead in the tie - immediately. When the goal came, it was so simple. Carvajal is given plenty of time down the right. Too much time: Clichy doesn\u2019t close his man down. Carvajal slides one forward to release Bale into the box. Bale takes a look across: he\u2019s got three men in the middle. But instead he belts a high ball across Hart from a tight angle. It rises and curls and dips and lashes into the top left! Did he mean that? It\u2019s genius if he did. But perhaps he didn\u2019t. And there might be a little deflection from Fernando, sliding in to block. Either way, it\u2019s the very definition of a cross-cum-shot. 18 min: Modric finds a pocket of space in the middle, 25 yards from goal. He thinks about shooting towards the top left, then the top right. As he shapes to curl one goalwards, a combination of Fernando and Fernandinho nip at his heels. He goes down looking for a free kick, but he\u2019s not getting one. It was fair hassle. The ball nearly squirts through the middle for Ronaldo, anyway, but there\u2019s too much pace on it and it flies through to Hart. 17 min: City can\u2019t get hold of the ball at all. Real are content to stroke it around in the midfield. For now. 15 min: Bale slips Carvajal into space down the right, but the full back\u2019s cross is wayward. City mop up. They look a little shaken in the wake of Kompany\u2019s injury, struggling to keep hold of the ball. They\u2019ll need to settle quickly, because Real appear to be in the mood to apply some pressure. 13 min: Bale tries to break free down the inside-left channel, but Fernando stands up well and blocks the path. But Real are beginning to work up a head of steam, and Carvajal, from deep on the right, curls one onto Ronaldo\u2019s head, ten yards out. Ronaldo climbs above Otamendi but heads high and wide right. A decent chance for someone so good in the air. 12 min: That early injury setback for City has ruined the early rhythm. Real pass it around the back awhile, warming themselves up again. 10 min: Kompany limps off, his race already run. It\u2019s difficult to watch as he reluctantly offloads his armband; the big man\u2019s had no luck with injury. Mangala comes on in his place. 8 min: Very worrying signs for City here, as Kompany goes down after playing a simple pass in the midfield. He clutches the top of his left leg, and grimaces quite a lot before going down. 7 min: Navas is seeing a fair bit of the ball out on the right. He strides inside and feeds Aguero on the edge of the D. Aguero tries to shift his feet to make room for a shot, but can\u2019t engineer the space. The ball\u2019s rolled left to De Bruyne, who tries to return it to Aguero with a low cross. It\u2019s blocked at source by Carvajal. 5 min: Isco and Jese combine down the left to earn the first corner of the match. It\u2019s looped into the City mixer, and after a brief bout of head tennis, Pepe sends a harmless header high into the air, allowing Hart to claim. It\u2019s been a bright start to a tense occasion. 3 min: Carvajal jigs down the right, cuts inside, and tries to find Jese on the edge of the box with a sliderule pass. It\u2019s a dainty ball, but the Real forward made his run too soon, and realising he\u2019s miles offside, doesn\u2019t bother chasing. City go upfield, though Navas down the right. He skips past Isco and whips a fine high cross along the corridor of uncertainty, but there\u2019s no City shirt in the middle. Nevertheless, Navas comes off his line and flaps the ball away in a slightly nervous fashion. Very strange, though it leads to nothing. 2 min: Ramos, from a deep position on the left, tries to set Jese free down the right. Nope! That\u2019ll be a goal kick. City go up the other end and immediately have three men flagged offside. Everyone finding their feet. City get the ball rolling. The travelling City support really are giving it their all: the Bernabeu is huge, and teeming with Madridistas, but you can still hear Blue Moon being sung at considerable volume. \u201cI\u2019m wondering who Atletico fans will be rooting for tonight?\u201d wonders Simon McMahon, a supporter of 1984 semi-finalists Dundee United. \u201cNo doubt a fair few will be itching to be given the chance of revenge against Real, but then that also brings with it the possibility of losing a Champions League final to them for the second time in three years. Losing to your city rivals in a match of such importance is not much fun. Take it from me.\u201d The teams are out! Real Madrid are in their famous meringue-white shirts, while Manchester City will play in third-choice neon green. It\u2019s hardly news to report that there\u2019s a crackling atmosphere at the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u for this European Cup semi-final. The home side are looking for their 11th title in this competition, while City are still seeking their first. But of course there\u2019s always a first time for everything, as Leicester City can attest. Marina Hyde is already looking forward to the film of the fairytale. But we digress. This is on! We\u2019ll be off in a minute! Manuel Pellegrini speaks! \u201cIt is important to realise that it is not easy to get to a semi-final. First you must be in the top four in your league, which is not easy in England. Then it is very difficult to continue after the group stage, the round of 16, the quarter final. So we must play, and fight for every ball to win the game and take our chance to reach the final. Our best opportunity is to play well in defence. Madrid are very dangerous and always look to attack. When we have the ball, we must not lose it. We will see if Yaya Toure is able to complete 90 minutes, but his experience in this game is very important.\u201d Whatever the outcome tonight, here\u2019s a reminder to enjoy every second while it lasts. Reaching the pinnacle of Europe is no guarantee that the good times will last forever. Next season, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa will become the first pair of former European champions to face off in second-tier domestic competition. The Knowledge has today been looking into this sorry state of affairs, in a must-read article that also features an advert for 1970s UK milk concern Unigate Dairies starring Muhammad Ali. Just a reminder of the result from the first leg: Manchester City 0.576734 - 0.972312 Real Madrid. That\u2019s according to the Expected Goals model. For those of you who haven\u2019t been experimenting with Kool-Aid or freebasing snake oil, it was 0-0. Another goalless draw is the only scoreline that\u2019d take us into extra time and possible penalty kicks tonight, away goals and all that. The big news for Real Madrid? You know the big news for Real Madrid: Cristiano Ronaldo is back! He\u2019s one of three changes to the XI that started in Manchester last week: Isco and Jese are the others who make the step up. Lucas Vazquez drops to the bench, while Casemiro and Karim Benzema are injured. City meanwhile name the same XI who began the first leg, with one exception. The hamstrung David Silva is replaced by a refreshed Yaya Toure. For the record, there are eight changes to the team sent out for the fiasco at Southampton at the weekend. Not that absolutely everyone had an off day: let\u2019s hope we still see the in-form and extremely promising Kelechi Iheanacho at some point tonight. Real Madrid: Navas, Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Modric, Kroos, Isco, Jese, Ronaldo, Bale. Subs: Casilla, Varane, James Rodriguez, Kovacic, Lucas Vazquez, Danilo, Mayoral. Manchester City: Hart, Sagna, Kompany, Otamendi, Clichy, Fernando, Fernandinho, Toure, Navas, De Bruyne, Aguero. Subs: Caballero, Mangala, Kolarov, Delph, Sterling, Bony, Iheanacho. Referee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia). Real Madrid are contesting the semi-finals of the European Cup for the 27th time in their history. So far, they\u2019ve won 13, and they\u2019ve lost 13, and the odds suggest statistical history is about to tip in their favour. That\u2019s because they\u2019ve won all five of their games at the Bernab\u00e9u in this season\u2019s competition, a run which has included a 3-0 victory against Wolfsburg in the quarters and a Champions League record-equalling 8-0 shellacking of Malm\u00f6 in the groups. If they experience the joy of six tonight, they\u2019ll have made it to their 14th final. The recent omens are good for Real. They\u2019re unbeaten in nine matches against English clubs, having drawn last week against Manchester City, seen off Liverpool home and away in last year\u2019s groups, knocked Manchester United out of the Round of 16 in 2013, beaten City at the Bernab\u00e9u in the 2012 groups before drawing in Manchester, and dispatched Spurs from the quarter finals in 2011. This represents something of a roll for La Liga\u2019s grandest club against the finest the Premier League has to offer. On the other hand, though, City have won three of their five away games in this season\u2019s competition. Their last visit to Spain saw them steamroller European specialists Sevilla 3-1 in the Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n, one of the Champions League performances of the campaign. And having won their first-ever European Cup knockout tie in this season\u2019s Round of 16, against Dynamo Kyiv - it was a long wait since losing to Fenerbah\u00e7e in the 1968-69 first round - they\u2019ve got up some momentum of their own. Real are favourites, yes. And Cristiano Ronaldo is back. But they\u2019re not always comfortable here against English opposition - Arsenal won at the Bernab\u00e9u in 2006, while Liverpool repeated the trick in 2009 - and City have the talent to sweep anybody aside on their day. Are Real heading for the final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in Milan? Or could this prove to be the biggest night in City\u2019s history? It\u2019ll be a blast finding out! It\u2019s the second Champions League semi-final! It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8.45pm local time in Madrid, 7.45pm back home in Manchester."
"1||Muslim women kicked out of California restaurant sue for discriminationSeven Muslim women who were kicked out of a southern California restaurant are suing the business for discrimination, alleging that they were singled out for wearing headscarves in an area that advocates say has seen an increase in hate crimes. The women, six of whom were wearing hijabs, say they were ordered to leave Urth Caffe in Laguna Beach on 22 April, ostensibly because they were violating a policy limiting seating to 45 minutes \u2013 even though video they took as they were exiting shows that there were open tables throughout the restaurant. The business, which is located near the beach in Orange County, was half empty at the time, and other non-Muslim women seated far longer than the Muslim women were not asked to leave, according to the lawsuit filed this week. After the women protested, management at the restaurant, which boasts \u201corganic coffees and fine teas\u201d, allegedly called its security guard and eventually local police to force the women to leave. \u201cI cried the whole way home,\u201d Sara Farsakh, 29, said in an interview. \u201cI was just so shocked and hurt by what happened.\u201d Farsakh posted a Facebook video showing many empty tables, along with footage of the police who showed up to escort them out. \u201cI am completely appalled by the racist and Islamophobic treatment some friends and I were subjected to by staff at Urth Caffe in Laguna Beach last night,\u201d she wrote on Facebook after the incident. \u201cWhat began as a night out with some friends ended as a painful and embarrassing reminder of what it is like to be visibly Muslim \u2013 even in liberal California. By visibly Muslim, I mean women who wear the hijab, or headscarf.\u201d The complaint, which seeks unspecified damages, states, \u201cUrth Caffe\u2019s removal of Plaintiffs was motivated not by Plaintiffs\u2019 violation of any company policy, but by its desire to cleanse the restaurant of visibly Muslim patrons who have been targets of recent neighborhood hate.\u201d The restaurant has been the site of numerous hate crimes against Muslims this year, according to the complaint. In March and April, \u201clocals unnerved by the increasing presence of Muslims in their community\u201d threw eggs at Muslim customers at Urth Caffe, slashed their tires and yelled \u201cracial taunts and epithets\u201d, the suit says. \u201cThat\u2019s really the key to why this is discrimination,\u201d said Mohammad Tajsar, attorney for the women, who range from 25 to 29 years old. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear motivation on the part of the management to appease the discriminators and the racists who had been basically annoyed and frustrated at the increasing presence of people who seemed like they were Muslim.\u201d Laguna Beach is 90% white, according to Census data. Even if the restaurant did not directly address the women\u2019s religion, it was a blatant case of prejudice, said Tajsar. \u201cDiscrimination in 2016 can be clear even if there isn\u2019t an outward religious slur.\u201d The restaurant has not apologized for the incident and instead defended its actions in a short Facebook post: \u201cUrth Caffe categorically denies any and all claims of racial or religious discrimination against Sara Farsakh. While a full investigation is still ongoing, it appears that Ms Farsakh and her friends violated company policies and that the staff at Urth Caffe in Laguna properly and justifiably applied company procedures.\u201d The restaurant\u2019s \u201cbusy time seating limit\u201d policy, a copy of which Farsakh posted on Facebook, says: \u201cIf tables are available, you are certainly welcome to enjoy Urth for as long as you desire.\u201d In its statement, Urth said it doesn\u2019t condone discrimination and \u201csincerely hopes that its customers will withhold judgment until all of the evidence in this case comes to light\u201d. The restaurant, a local chain with locations throughout southern California, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Farsakh, a student, said she was compelled to file a lawsuit in part because of the increasing discrimination that Muslims have faced in the wake of racist rhetoric in American politics. Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, called for a ban on Muslims entering the US in December. \u201cWith the current political climate, this type of stuff is increasing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe felt so embarrassed and shocked. You can\u2019t believe it when it\u2019s happening to you.\u201d Farsakh, the one woman in the group who was not wearing a headscarf, said she stopped wearing a hijab in part because of her fears about discrimination. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to be concerned about my mother, my mother-in-law, my friends and future daughters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable for anybody to have to go through this based off of the way that they look.\u201d"
"15||Betrayed by their party, Republicans voted Trump. But will he betray them too?Donald J Trump, a thrice-married billionaire businessman who holds many positions that are anathema to the mainstream conservative movement, is now the presumptive nominee of our Republican party. To understand how this happened, you need look no further than the party itself. One of the most startling and eye-popping numbers from primary after primary this year has been the percentage of Republican voters who have said they \u201cfeel betrayed by Republican politicians\u201d. In Indiana this week, 50% of Republican voters said they felt that way. Earlier, we saw 58% in Michigan, 59% in Pennsylvania, 60% in Florida. The list goes on and on and on. The average Republican voter is right to feel betrayed by Republican politicians \u2013 and more broadly by the conservative movement. After all, voters have been lied to for years. There is an old saying: under-promise and over-deliver. Republican politicians in Washington, and the network of conservative groups surrounding them, have done the exact opposite. They have made promises to voters that they knew at the time they had no chance of actually keeping. Conservative advocacy groups have raised tens of millions of dollars off of conservatives promising to help deliver what they know is fundamentally undeliverable. To pass the Affordable Care Act (more commonly known as Obamacare), the Democrats needed a Democrat in the White House, a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and a majority in the House. To repeal Obamacare, by definition, Republicans would have needed the same thing. That, unfortunately, didn\u2019t stop Republican politicians and conservative advocacy groups desperate for votes and dollars to promise to do just that \u2013 knowing full well that they couldn\u2019t deliver on that promise. Instead of telling voters the truth \u2013 that conservatives would need to win back the White House, win 60 seats in the Senate and win control of the House to effectuate real conservative policy change \u2013 they chose to peddle a politically expedient fantasy. Voters gave Republicans the House, and then the Senate and a larger majority in the House. And yet Obamacare wasn\u2019t repealed, spending wasn\u2019t reduced, taxes weren\u2019t cut, the bureaucracy wasn\u2019t shrunk \u2013 conservatives didn\u2019t get what they were promised. And now the chickens are coming home to roost. Instead of going for more experienced candidates, voters are instead choosing to take their chances with the ultimate political outsider. Just how long did the party and the conservative advocacy groups believe that they could keep this charade up? Did they think that the base was so docile and so gullible that there would be no day of reckoning? In 2010, the Tea Party revolution threatened to take down the Republican party and the entire Republican establishment. Instead of fighting the Tea Party, the party sought to keep them in the fold by deftly coopting their messaging. How long did they think that they could keep these forces in check with nothing more than empty hollow rhetoric? No one embodies the Republican\u2019s problem with the truth more than Ted Cruz \u2013 it is why, in part, he made such an awful alternative to Trump. No one in Washington has over-promised and under-delivered more than Cruz. It is Cruz who convinced people that all we had to do was shut down the government to get Obamacare repealed \u2013 Cruz knew that was a lie. He has made a name for himself in Washington by tilting at windmills and advancing his own career at the expense of his colleagues and his party. With every election and every passing Congress, the anger was growing within the base of the Republican party. It hit a tipping point in this presidential election cycle \u2013 and there stood Donald Trump. Trump, the outsider, the guy reviled by the establishment, the blunt-spoken executive, tapped into that anger and those feelings of betrayal and rode it all the way to the Republican party\u2019s presidential nomination. In riding this wave of anger, Trump has made his own promises \u2013 to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, to crush Isis, to bring back manufacturing jobs, to make our allies pay their fair share and to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d. The challenge for Mr Trump is now how will he keep his promises. If he doesn\u2019t, the lying will continue, and the anger within the Republican party will continue to boil."
"16||El Ni\u00f1o weakens, but India and south-east Asia heatwave continuesIndia and many parts of south-east Asia have been struggling with a severe heatwave, caused in part by the El Ni\u00f1o conditions across the Pacific. El Ni\u00f1o, characterised by warmer than normal Pacific equatorial waters, has continued for several months and has been the strongest such event on record. Although the El Ni\u00f1o has begun to weaken rapidly in recent weeks its effects are still being felt, especially in exacerbating the hot and dry conditions across India and south-east Asia. Temperatures in Thailand exceeded 40C (104F) every day during April, while neighbouring Cambodia and Laos have set all-time temperature records during the heatwave. The Indian state of Bihar last week implemented a ban on cooking between 9am and 6pm, in an attempt to prevent accidental fires. Meanwhile in Darwin, Australia, the start of the dry season was interrupted on Tuesday by a storm that brought torrential rain and frequent lightning. At at Darwin airport 47.2mm (1.85in) of rain was recorded in 90 minutes, more than twice the average rainfall for the whole of May. The recent wet season in Darwin has been unusually dry, another symptom of the strong El Ni\u00f1o. Further south in Australia, there was heavy rain and damaging winds across Tasmania and Victoria over the past few days as an active cold front moved through. Wind gusts exceeded 60mph in places, bringing down trees and damaging buildings, and waves in excess of six metres battered many western coastal areas."
"12||A war photographer's image of hell \u2013 recreated in a play he can't bear to seePaul Watson has seen things few would ever want to see. As a photographer he did not divert his gaze and turn away, but rather devoured the bleakest obscenities of war with his camera. In Somalia, most famously, he risked his life to capture the image of an American soldier\u2019s corpse being desecrated by a vengeful mob. Yet at Theater J in Washington there is something that Watson cannot face. Since his story was turned into an award-winning stage play in 2012, he has not been able to bring himself to read it or see it. When he does venture into a theatre it is always after the final curtain to answer audience questions, unaware of precisely what they have just seen. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about,\u201d the 56-year-old Canadian explains. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could survive listening to it.\u201d The Body of an American focuses on how Watson\u2019s life was changed by a photo he took during a disastrous American military intervention in Somalia in 1993, dramatised in the Hollywood movie Black Hawk Down. In July that year, a crowd had beaten four journalists to death. Most of the media then left, but the Toronto Star reporter and photographer was one of the few to stay behind. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up and I\u2019m a bit wiser than I was and I don\u2019t really like who I was then,\u201d he admits frankly, from Vancouver. \u201cI was reckless and I didn\u2019t give a shit about what happened, which is just not a healthy thing to say, but I knew something big was coming so I thought fuck it, I\u2019m staying.\u201d In October, during a 16-hour battle against Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid, a US army Black Hawk helicopter was shot down. Watson discovered a gang cheering, dancing and dragging American staff sergeant William David Cleveland through the streets of Mogadishu. He recalls in a steady voice: \u201cI saw the body and the first thing I\u2019m thinking is, is he alive? Because he has rope bound by his wrists and also his ankle or leg, and they were tossing him back and forth like a marionette. I expected he would be stiff and he wasn\u2019t. \u201cEverything\u2019s moving very fast, obviously, but I had a brief expectation that I might see his eyes move or something. Then I thought, I need to take a picture and as I raised it [the camera], I heard a voice. We all know our inner voice and this sounded like a voice that was inside my head and outside my head at the same time, and it didn\u2019t sound like me. Amid all the muffled turmoil that had receded into the back of my mind, this was as clear as a bell. It just seemed otherworldly and it said: \u2018If you do this, I\u2019ll own you for ever.\u2019\u201d Watson, who has suffered depression and post-traumatic stress disorder after years of photographing war-zone victims, never received a psychiatric explanation that satisfied him. It remains a disquieting mystery to him. \u201cA bunch of soldiers wrote me letters, mostly hateful, but one wrote me a letter some years after the fact and he said, \u2018For what it\u2019s worth, I knew him and he wouldn\u2019t have used an expression like \u201cown you forever\u201d.\u2019 After reading that I thought well, I wouldn\u2019t use that expression, so wherever it came from, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Watson says he did not hesitate to take the picture because, a week or so earlier, there had been another incident in which a dead American\u2019s body parts were paraded through the streets but which the Pentagon suppressed. He was determined that this time the truth must be told. He adds: \u201cWhen I heard that voice, I spoke without speaking because it was happening either in my mind or around me. I said: \u2018Please understand why I have to do this.\u2019 That was referenced to the September incident, that if I don\u2019t make a picture of you, they\u2019re going to deny what happened to you, and God knows what\u2019s happening to the others.\u201d The photo was indeed a wake-up call for public opinion in the US. The American military pulled out of Somalia in March 1994. Watson, who was born one-handed, won a Pulitzer prize for the image but was tormented by the knowledge that it would be last image of Cleveland that the soldier\u2019s family would ever see. In the years that followed he tried to make contact with Cleveland\u2019s family. He tracked down his mother to a trailer park and called her from a motel, leaving a message. \u201cThat night I got a call from her son, who I believe is in a totally different city, and he was livid. I recorded the conversation because I record things and I\u2019m glad I did because I couldn\u2019t process it as it was happening, but I listened to it over and over again and it\u2019s really an extraordinary conversation because at times he\u2019s just angry and I\u2019m sort of begging for forgiveness because that\u2019s all I want, for someone to say it\u2019s OK. \u201cAnd he kind of forgives me by saying \u2018You were just doing your job\u2019, which is really to me a knife in the heart. It\u2019s not forgiveness because I think I was doing something other than my job. That\u2019s not to sound grandiose. I wasn\u2019t there for a paycheque, I wasn\u2019t there to do anything other than to make sure the Pentagon didn\u2019t say it didn\u2019t happen, and I think that\u2019s something other than a job.\u201d The conversation with Cleveland\u2019s brother is recreated almost verbatim in The Body of an American, written by Dan O\u2019Brien, which has been performed to acclaim in cities including New York and London. It also depicts Watson trying to come to terms with a career of risk-taking in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Rwanda, Syria, South Africa and Iraq, where he was attacked by a mob. He has said he felt Cleveland was watching and that his death would have been \u201cpoetic justice\u201d. In the same year that Watson took his searing image in Somalia, Kevin Carter, a member of what was dubbed \u201cthe Bang-Bang Club\u201d of photographers chronicling township violence in 1990s South Africa, took a picture of a vulture watching a starving child in Sudan. It too won a Pulitzer. But shadowed by the horrors he witnessed during his brief but brilliant career, Carter killed himself the following year aged 33. Watson knows it could have been him. \u201cI was definitely close to killing myself a few times,\u201d he says. \u201cThis one time I was really over the edge. Two fortunate things: I didn\u2019t have a weapon to kill myself and I\u2019m not of the nature to kill myself violently; if I\u2019d had medicine or something I probably would have done it. I phoned my brother overseas and he talked me out of it.\u201d He continues: \u201cI hate even saying it now but it\u2019s true: I used to go to these places hoping somebody would kill me because I couldn\u2019t kill myself. I just didn\u2019t have the strength, I didn\u2019t have the courage to do it. I eventually found my way through all of that. I reached the stage where I thought I was pretty much dead anyway. You sort of reconcile yourself with the end and there\u2019s no need to kill yourself any more. It\u2019s coming at some point; I just hope it\u2019s fast.\u201d Watson, who has a 15-year-old son, quit the Toronto Star last year after a dispute with its editors. He is now writing a book. Asked if he has come to terms with that day in Mogadishu, he replies: \u201cIt\u2019s locked away in a place and I\u2019ve got it pretty tightly locked there. \u201cIt only really comes back when I talk about it, because it unlocks that door and it\u2019s all just very real. It takes me a long time to recover from it. The only reason to talk about it is the fact Dan made this incredible play.\u201d O\u2019Brien learned of his story when Watson wrote a memoir and gave an interview on America\u2019s National Public Radio (NPR) in 2007. The playwright and poet, based in Los Angeles, recalls: \u201cPart of what haunted me was I had a severe, and kind of mysterious to me, over-identification with him. There was something about his psychology, even about his voice. There was just something I really hyper-identified with in a way I\u2019ve never done before or since. \u201cJournalists are trying to find the truth that often people don\u2019t want to hear or see. That\u2019s very central to how I think about myself as an artist. Of course I\u2019ve never been to a combat zone. The most terrifying thing I can think of is the opening night of a play.\u201d O\u2019Brien made contact via email and, a couple years later, the men met in a hamlet in the Arctic and got to know each other over a week. This is also featured in the play, which shows O\u2019Brien, who has been estranged from his parents and most of his siblings for a decade, struggling with his own ghosts. \u201cI prefer ghosts to demons,\u201d the 42-year-old says. When writer and subject are due to field questions from a theatre audience, they usually go out for dinner and time their arrival for the final curtain. But one night they got there too early and waited in a dressing room, only to find the sound being piped in. Watson had to cover up his ears while O\u2019Brien scrambled for the volume control. O\u2019Brien, who has written poetry inspired by Watson and is currently working on a play about journalists in Syria, is far from insulted that his muse refuses to watch The Body of an American. \u201cI truly believe what he says, that it would be such a stress and a strain,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIt would be a panic attack while he was watching it and who knows what it would do to his mental health for the coming weeks afterwards. So I don\u2019t have any great desire for him to see it. I think there\u2019s something kind of special we have in the trust that we have without him having actually seen or read it.\u201d The Body of an American is playing at Theater J in Washington DC until 22 May.

"18||John Crace\u2019s sketch: LOQs give Dave a breakDave was fed up. Being prime minister wasn\u2019t as much fun as he had hoped. Half his party now hated him for supporting the EU, Boris was gunning for his job, he\u2019d been made to do a photo op with the comatose Zac \u2013 Jesus, was the guy alive or not? \u2013 and now he\u2019d been forced into a humiliating climbdown over child refugees. Why couldn\u2019t they have found somewhere to go on their own? Whatever happened to a sense of adventure? To round off a thoroughly bad 24 hours, he now had to waste half an hour on another prime minister\u2019s questions. Sod it. He wouldn\u2019t bother. \u201cCould the prime minister explain his cuts in social care?\u201d asked Jeremy Corbyn. Dave\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do things differently this week. I\u2019m going to pretend to be the leader of the opposition and I\u2019m going to ask you the questions. So, you tell me why Labour is riddled with antisemites and why Hamas and Hezbollah came to your birthday party.\u201d Corbyn wasn\u2019t entirely happy at this turn of events. He hadn\u2019t banked on being prime minister just yet. If ever. But to give no answer at all would be tricky. \u201cI can assure you no racists ever came to my birthday party,\u201d he insisted. \u201cCan we now go back to the government\u2019s social care policy?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d said Dave. \u201cIt is a complete outrage. It always used to be the Tories who were the natural home of racists and now Labour has stolen our policy. I demand some answers.\u201d It would probably have been better if, at this point, Corbyn had tried to explain how, though Hamas had been at his birthday party, they weren\u2019t BFFs and he had only invited them in the hope they might behave a bit better. Instead he chose to attack the prime minister for the Conservative party\u2019s smear campaign against his friend, Sadiq Khan, in London mayoral contest. \u201cYou complete idiot,\u201d shouted Sadiq, from somewhere in greater London \u201cYou\u2019ve just cost me another 10,000 votes. We\u2019re not friends and we never will be.\u201d Dave saw absolutely nothing wrong in trying to make out that since Sadiq was a Muslim he was therefore almost certainly a terrorist. \u201cSadiq has been spotted talking to some extremely unpleasant people,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them may even have been members of the Conservative party. This proves that if he is elected as London mayor there will definitely be a terrorist atrocity somewhere in the world at some point in the next two years. So vote for the dopey bloke instead.\u201d With LOQs (Leader of Opposition questions) having descended into a toxic mix of competitive racism and electioneering, Dave cheered up a bit. He hadn\u2019t had to answer a single question about his government\u2019s social care policy. Which was just as well, because he hadn\u2019t a clue if it had one. Just as he was about to congratulate himself on slipping off the hook, Dave remembered he had an appearance before the liaison committee later than afternoon to explain the government\u2019s support for remaining in the EU. Damn it. There wasn\u2019t much chance of him getting away with not answering the questions of every select committee chair. Still he\u2019d give it a go. \u201cGood afternoon prime minister,\u201d said Andrew Tyrie, the committee\u2019s capo di tutti capi. \u201cWould you be recommending a remain vote in the referendum if you hadn\u2019t managed to renegotiate anything?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a hypothetical question,\u201d said Dave, evenly. \u201cNo it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a straightforward yes or no.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a conditional question because it\u2019s got an if in it.\u201d One down ten to go. Dave looked warily at the rest of the committee. At least half of them were angry Brexiteers who were bound to make trouble. Bill Cash wouldn\u2019t be a problem because nobody took any notice of him any more. But Bernard Jenkin would be tricky. Conspiracy theorists always are. \u201cI want you to take down every government website during the referendum campaign,\u201d insisted Bernie. \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Dave. \u201cBecause they will secretly talk to people to make them vote to remain.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re overreacting a bit.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve got a legal precedent about a golf club notice from 1937.\u201d A look of concern passed over the face of every committee member. They hadn\u2019t realised just how unwell Bernie had become. But Bernie wasn\u2019t to be stopped. \u201cIf you don\u2019t obey me you can expect a letter before action.\u201d \u201cCalm down, Bernie.\u201d \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll get a writ.\u201d Dave was back where he had started the day, falling out with his own party. Now he came to think of it, he rather missed LOQs."
"13||Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s emails: using private server could be \u2018major security risk\u2019, says LaborPotentially \u201chundreds of emails\u201d that relate to national security matters could have been communicated over Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s private email server in what could amount to a \u201cmajor security risk\u201d, according to the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus. The prime minister\u2019s office, in a response to a freedom of information request from Dreyfus obtained by Guardian Australia, said too many emails would need to be examined so it was refusing to process Dreyfus\u2019s request for them. Turnbull\u2019s office said the prime minister always handled classified documents in accordance with the protective security policy framework. In October it was revealed he had been operating a separate email server outside the parliamentary email system, raising questions over both security implications and the potentially limited public access to the records under freedom of information and archive laws. Concerns about the use of the private server echo debate over the US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Her private emails are now being periodically released by the State Department. Dreyfus lodged a freedom of information request in November seeking access to documents on Turnbull\u2019s email server relating to national security, international relations and national security cabinet meetings. He received a response this week from Turnbull\u2019s office, which said it would not be processing the request on the grounds that it would \u201cunreasonably interfere\u201d with its functions. \u201cThe terms of your request are broad,\u201d the response said. \u201cAs it covers documents that \u2018mention or relate to\u2019 the broad topics of national security and international relations and has no date limitation, processing would request examination of the content of hundreds of emails.\u201d The response indicated some of these documents would be relatively uncontroversial, and gave the example that emails would \u201crelate\u201d to Australia\u2019s international relations if they quoted or referred to a media article about Australia\u2019s relations with another country. The response said a keyword search for the term \u201cnational security committee of cabinet\u201d had been conducted and had found no documents. Dreyfus said the response was astonishing and called on the prime minister to give a full explanation. \u201cWithin this letter is an apparent admission that there are \u2018hundreds of emails\u2019 that relate to national security or international relations on prime minister Turnbull\u2019s private server,\u201d he said. \u201cI find this absolutely astonishing. \u201cPrime minister Turnbull has just spent $230m on a cyber security strategy. Yet he is apparently using private email servers, rather than secure government servers, to communicate sensitive information. This is a major security risk, and also raises significant transparency concerns. As head of Australian government, the prime minister must hold himself to the highest standards in these matters. \u201cMr Turnbull needs to give a full explanation as to why he is apparently using his private email for prime ministerial business, and commit to stopping this practice immediately.\u201d Turnbull\u2019s office told Dreyfus: \u201cIt appears ... that you may be more concerned with the question of whether official documents dealing with sensitive national security and foreign relations matters are held on the prime minister\u2019s private email server, rather than with obtaining access to particular documents. \u201cIn that regard, I can assure you that the prime minister takes national security extremely seriously and that all classified documents are dealt with by this office in accordance with the Commonwealth protective security policy framework.\u201d The deputy secretary of national security, Allan McKinnon, has previously issued advice tabled in the Senate in which he wrote that government information may be conveyed on a range of devices where the information is unclassified or not sensitive. Turnbull\u2019s office has breached the strict deadlines set out in freedom of information laws in its handling of the requests for his email server. Dreyfus\u2019s request was delayed by several months. Separately, a request from Guardian Australia for official emails on Turnbull\u2019s private server from a three-week period has reached a similar stage. After a lengthy delay Guardian Australia appealed to the information commissioner. In April the prime minister\u2019s office issued a notice saying the request would be too broad to process. The use of the private email server has raised concerns about the reach of Australia\u2019s freedom of information and archiving laws. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet previously stated it would not release emails from Turnbull\u2019s private email server, arguing it \u201cdoes not have access to or provide administration support\u201d for personal email servers and holds no records in its possession. Had Turnbull\u2019s private email server been managed by the department \u2013 as normally occurs with government emails \u2013 it would have been accessible by it and subject to Guardian Australia\u2019s freedom of information request. Instead, requests for his emails are being funnelled through his own personal office. In the response to Dreyfus, it says the fact the emails need to be separated from Turnbull\u2019s personal emails is one of the factors adding to the burden placed on the agency to process the request. The information commissioner\u2019s guidelines state that \u201cpoor record keeping or an inefficient filing system\u201d would not of itself be sufficient grounds to allow an agency or minister to refuse a request. The prime minister\u2019s office has been contacted for comment."
"7||Wada insists laboratory bans will not affect testing before Rio OlympicsThe World Anti-Doping Agency has insisted that testing in the run-up to the Rio Olympic Games will not be adversely affected despite four accredited laboratories now being suspended. On Tuesday the Bloemfontein laboratory in South Africa \u2013 the only Wada\u2011accredited lab in Africa \u2013 was added to a list that includes Lisbon and Beijing. The Moscow laboratory\u2019s accreditation was revoked last year following revelations of state\u2011sponsored doping in Russia. The ruling means all samples previously examined in Bloemfontein, which can appeal against its suspension to the court of arbitration for sport, must be sent for analysis in a different continent, with 30 other laboratories still accredited worldwide by Wada. A spokesman from the organisation said: \u201cThere is a very robust pre-Rio anti-doping programme in place. Central to this is the establishment of an intelligence group that will have oversight of all pre\u2011Games testing conducted by national anti-doping organisations and international federations. \u201cThe work of this intelligence group will allow for target testing, and ensure that there are no gaps in the pre-Games programme. \u201cOnce the Olympic Village opens, the information obtained by this intelligence group will be transferred to the IOC, Brazilian Anti-Doping Agency, Wada Independent Observer team and other experts to ensure that effective testing continues during that period and the Games itself. \u201cDuring the period of suspension for the Bloemfontein, Lisbon and Beijing laboratories, all samples will be sent securely to another Wada-accredited laboratory where they will be analysed, ensuring that athletes can have full confidence in continued high-quality sample analysis and the wider anti-doping system. \u201cWhenever a laboratory does not meet the stringent standards set by Wada, we have the ability to suspend the laboratory\u2019s accreditation \u2013 this demonstrates the importance of upholding the highest standards, so that athletes retain full confidence in the system.\u201d In 2013 Wada suspended the accreditation for the laboratory in Rio, because of repeated failures to meet standards. Concerns were raised before the 2014 World Cup in Brazil but samples were sent to Switzerland for examination."
"0||Arizona school poster describing girls as 'meat' and boys as 'wolves' is removedA poster at an Arizona school that compared girls to meat and boys to wolves has been taken down after a picture of it taken by a student was widely shared on social media. The poster, which has the caption \u201cSo you think you come to school looking pretty cute\u201d under a picture of what appear to be scantily clad anime characters, then the caption \u201cbut what boys see is meat\u201d under a picture of a wolf, was spotted in the library of Desert Ridge high school in Mesa, Arizona, by senior Alissa Adams during a class on 27 April. It goes on to say that \u201cit is distracting \u2026 so they go on to get lousy grades \u2026 but then you end up with one of them anyway because he thought you looked HOT.\u201d \u201cAs we started reading it, we all just started looking at each other like, \u2018is this serious?\u2019\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt says that because girls dress revealingly, then boys will then fail because of us.\u201d \u201c[The class is] boys and girls, and everyone was offended by it,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI was so mad that I had to say something.\u201d She said that she asked the librarian to take it down, but the librarian refused. Under the final caption, which reads \u201cBut it\u2019s okay \u2013 because you looked cute today!\u201d \u2013 the word \u201ctoday\u201d is underlined \u2013 Adams, who said that she was \u201cso mad\u201d, took out her pen and wrote \u201cso it\u2019s the girls\u2019 fault, right?\u201d and appended the hashtag \u201c#feminism\u201d, then tweeted the photo. The following day, the poster was removed by school officials. \u201cThat was nice,\u201d Adams said. \u201cNice little win for us.\u201d Adams said she had received \u201cthousands\u201d of supportive comments since sending the tweet, but also a number of negative ones. \u201cPeople have tweeted me saying \u2018you need to let this go\u2019 and \u2018go hide under your bed\u2019, or \u2018you don\u2019t understand this now, but the world isn\u2019t as good as you think it is\u2019, and \u2018you\u2019ll understand when you grow up\u2019, and I\u2019m like \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure I can understand a sexist poster now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of rude comments about how the post is fine, and I\u2019m just a liberal loudmouth \u2013 and I\u2019m not even liberal,\u201d she said. \u201cThe poster was offensive. It doesn\u2019t take a liberal to see that.\u201d Irene Mahoney-Paige, a spokeswoman for the Gilbert Schools system, said in a statement that the poster had been in the library \u201cfor some time\u201d and it was not clear when it was made or by whom. \u201cThe librarian hung it up last week and as soon as it was brought to the attention of the Principal, it was promptly removed,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe Principal has spoken to the librarian and has also met with students and student council. Hanging of the poster was inappropriate and very poor judgement on behalf of the librarian. It is not reflective of the spirit and community of Desert Ridge High School or the Gilbert Public Schools District.\u201d"
"4||Greens' want 1.2m households to install renewable energy storageThe Greens want millions of households to install renewable energy storage units, saying battery storage could \u201crevolutionise\u201d Australia\u2019s energy system. They have announced a five-year support package for 1.2m homes and 30,000 businesses, to encourage the take-up of solar storage across Australia. The Greens say the program - estimated to cost $2.9b - could be funded by scrapping concessions to fossil fuel-intensive industries, and are promising to make the policy central to their post-budget and post-election negotiations with the Coalition and Labor. \u201cWe\u2019ll be opposing most of this budget, which grows inequality and does nothing for clean energy, but if the government comes to us to talk about some of their less-offensive measures, we\u2019ll want to talk to them about programs like this one,\u201d the Greens energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, told Guardian Australia. \u201cNow is the time to jumpstart the battery industry, encourage the take up of storage and help make Australia a renewable energy leader.\u201d The Greens\u2019 battery storage program - announced two days after the Turnbull government\u2019s first budget - would run for five years, starting from 2016-17. It is part of their plan to shift Australia to 90% renewables by 2030. It includes a 50% refundable tax credit for individuals to help them install solar energy storage systems. Individuals would get up to half the cost of their storage system covered, up to a maximum of $5,000 in the first year of the program. The credit would then taper off to $1,500 by 2021, reflecting the projected decline in battery storage costs over five years. A separate grant scheme would also be available for people on low incomes. It would be available in addition to the refundable tax credit, for households with taxable income of less than $80,000. The low income grants would be capped at $5,000, and would decline to $1,000 by 2021. The number of grants would be capped at 20,000 each year. They say the household policy is estimated by the Parliamentary Budget Office to cost $2.8b over four years, supporting 1.2m homes with an average storage capacity of 10 KWh. For businesses, the Greens want to allow battery storage installations to be depreciated for tax purposes over three years - rather than the current 15 years - to drive the take-up of renewable energy storage. They say 30,000 units could be installed by businesses for $38m, over four years. The household and business programs could be funded by scrapping accelerated asset depreciation for aircraft and the oil and gas industry, they say. According to the PBO, the removal of accelerated depreciation would save $2.75bn over four years. The Greens say their program would only be necessary for five years, since the costs of battery storage are predicted to decrease rapidly over the next decade. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, on Wednesday criticised the Turnbull government\u2019s budget for doing nothing to help Australia become a renewable energy powerhouse. \u201cThere are small businesses right around Australia who will be so disappointed that the prime minister has ignored the transition to the clean-energy economy,\u201d Di Natale said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about solar installers, mums and dads who have set up small businesses to engage in the installation of solar panels around the country. \u201cThey don\u2019t get a benefit because the prime minister refuses to accept that this is a part of the economy that needs to grow, that can grow, that can create jobs and investment.\u201d The Turnbull government has confirmed it will retain the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, with plans to refocus part of their activities towards the government\u2019s innovation agenda. The budget papers show $1b of the CEFC\u2019s existing funding will be used to establish a clean energy innovation fund, to provide debt and equity financing to help emerging clean energy technologies \u201cmake the leap from demonstration to commercial deployment\u201d."
"10||Lee Daniels apologizes to Sean Penn for allegations he abused MadonnaThe $10m defamation suit against Hollywood producer Lee Daniels by actor Sean Penn has been settled, with Daniels apologizing for insinuating Penn abused his ex-wife Madonna and paying to the charity Penn founded. \u201cI am so sorry that I have hurt you, Sean, and I apologize and retract my reckless statements about you. How thoughtless of me. You are someone I consider a friend, a brilliant actor and true Hollywood legend and humanitarian,\u201d said the director of The Butler and Precious, in a joint statement released on Wednesday. Penn slapped Daniels with a $10m defamation suit last September, after the creator of hip-hop royalty television show Empire spoke about how actor Terrence Howard received intense criticism for admitting he\u2019d punched his ex-wife. Daniels told the Hollywood Reporter Howard \u201cain\u2019t done nothing different than Marlon Brando or Sean Penn, and all of a sudden he\u2019s some fucking demon\u201d. Rumors had swirled for years that Penn had been violent towards Madonna during their marriage, after the singer once called the Los Angeles police department to their home in 1988. However, Madonna provided a sworn affidavit to the Penn side that \u201cSean has never struck me, \u2018tied me up,\u2019 or physically assaulted me, and any report to the contrary is completely outrageous, malicious, reckless, and false.\u201d In his statement Daniels noted that it was \u201cwrong to reference gossip as fact, as I did here. That can be very damaging and hurtful. \u201cDomestic violence is a very serious issue,\u201d he added. \u201cMy comments were cavalier; it was not my intention to diminish the severity of the issue, but rather to express a view regarding the disparate treatment of men of color in our national conversation.\u201d In response, Penn said: \u201cI accept Lee\u2019s heartfelt apology and appreciate the sincerity with which it was delivered.\u201d Penn also thanked Daniel\u2019s \u201cgenerous\u201d donation to J/P Haitian Relief Organization, the charity Penn founded, noting the money \u201cwill have a transformative effect on the lives of those we serve in Haiti\u201d. It\u2019s unknown how large the settlement and donation was. Penn\u2019s lawyer, Mathew Rosengart of Greenberg Traurig in Los Angeles, declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. Daniels\u2019 lawyer, James Sammataro of Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan, was away on leave."
"18||Jeremy Corbyn's aide clarifies earlier remarks about local electionsJeremy Corbyn\u2019s claim that Labour will not lose seats in Thursday\u2019s local council elections but is instead seeking to make gains was misinterpreted, according to his official spokesman. The aide said his leader\u2019s comment \u2013 \u201cwe are not going to lose seats, we are looking to gain seats where we can\u201d \u2013 should not be taken as a prediction of what might happen. As the public prepares to vote in Scottish, Welsh and English local elections, the adviser said: \u201cI\u2019m telling you what he intended to say. He was saying we were not in the business of losing seats.\u201d It came amid internal fears inside Labour that the party could be set to lose control of a string of English councils, including Dudley, Redditch, Southampton, Plymouth and Cannock Chase, although there is hope that Sadiq Khan will win the London mayoralty. One source said the worst case scenario was that 10 councils would be lost in the wake of an antisemitism crisis that has gripped the party for over a week and resulted in the suspensions of Naz Shah MP and the former London mayor Ken Livingstone. A Labour spokeswoman confirmed that three more activists had been suspended from the party on Wednesday and were facing investigations. That included the vice chair of the South Thanet party, Jackie Walker, who published an online post asking \u201cwhat debt do we owe the Jews?\u201d Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, said the furore was damaging the party\u2019s prospects north of the border. \u201cIt has unquestionably had an effect,\u201d she said, claiming that the subject was coming up on doorsteps. Labour council leaders campaigning hard across southern England told the Guardian that their battles were too close to call. Jon Clempner, Labour leader of Harlow council, said: \u201cTo be perfectly frank, it\u2019s going to be very tight [to keep control of the council].\u201d He said Labour campaigners were talking up local issues over national politics and the EU referendum. Peter Lamb, the council leader in Crawley, said some believed that Labour risked losing control because it only had a majority of one. However, he suggested it would be devastating for local campaigners if that happened. \u201cGiven the history of the seat it would be unprecedented for us to lose control in a year when [the national party is] in opposition,\u201d he said. In Plymouth the council\u2019s leader, Tudor Evans, said the party had had a good election night in 2012 and so was now defending 12 seats. The council is in no overall control but could be taken by the Tories if they win three seats. \u201cIt is on a knife edge,\u201d admitted Evans. \u201cIt is too close to call.\u201d David Cameron used his weekly prime minister\u2019s questions on the eve of the elections to challenge Corbyn relentlessly over his links to extremist groups with antisemitic views, calling on him four times to withdraw having once described Hamas and Hezbollah as friends. The prime minister turned the weekly session on its head, ignoring Corbyn\u2019s questions about domestic policy and instead declaring: \u201cThose organisations in their constitutions believe in persecuting and killing Jews, they are antisemitic organisations, they are racist organisations, he must stand up and say they are not his friends.\u201d The prime minister also hit out at Khan, whom he accused of repeatedly sharing platforms with extremists. Corbyn strongly defended Khan, whom he said was being smeared, and insisted Labour was an anti-racist party that would not tolerate antisemitism. However he failed to directly withdraw his previous comments about Hamas and Hezbollah. Instead he said that he did not approve of either organisation, adding: \u201cAnyone who commits racist acts or is antisemitic is not a friend of mine.\u201d The controversy could affect the party in the elections, with one poll finding that only 8.5% of British Jews would vote Labour in Thursday\u2019s election. The survey for the Jewish Chronicle found that support has plummeted since last year\u2019s election, when 18% of the paper\u2019s Jewish community said they voted Labour under Ed Miliband\u2019s leadership. Alan Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, told the Yorkshire Post he was concerned about the 18 suspensions over allegations of antisemitism. \u201cI am worried about it. It\u2019s not my party, it\u2019s not the party I joined \u2026 These accusations need to be looked at and the people involved need to be rooted out and to make sure that we are anti-racist in everything we do and that we get rid of any racists [who] we might have [who] infiltrate our ranks. I don\u2019t think it has an impact [on the local elections]. It might have an impact on mayoral elections. I hope not.\u201d Robert Hayward, the elections analyst and Conservative peer, said the overall results would be seen through the prism of Labour\u2019s performance. Corbyn will face a barrage of criticism if the party does poorly, with rumours in Westminster that some shadow cabinet members may resign and there could be calls for the leader himself to step down. \u201cThe risk for the Labour party is that [it] will be almost non-existent in southern England and hit fairly hard in many of its remaining bases in the Midlands,\u201d said Hayward. Some are also warning that Labour could slip into third place in Scotland behind the Tories and slip backwards in Wales. However, on a more positive note for the Labour party, it is the Conservatives who have come under more pressure than other parties in council by-elections since the start of the year. Analysis by the Press Association finds that the Tories, who have faced controversy themselves over the EU and a budget rebellion, have lost 10 seats in town hall contests, particularly to independents, in recent weeks and have gained only two. In recent weeks, Conservatives have seen losses to independents in council byelections at Allerdale, Craven, East Riding of Yorkshire and North Kesteven."
"18||Former chief constable calls for public inquiry into Orgreave clashes and beyondA public inquiry should examine the way Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government used the police to occupy communities during the 1980s miners\u2019 strike, a former chief constable has said. Sir Peter Fahy said the police attitudes that caused public outrage last week, following the Hillsborough inquest verdicts, were fostered by events such as the government using officers to crush one of Britain\u2019s bitterest industrial disputes. Fahy retired in 2015 as chief constable of Greater Manchester police, one of Britain\u2019s biggest forces. He said the use of police to serve a political agenda in the 1980s created a \u201cthem and us\u201d culture, evident in the police response at Hillsborough. The legacy was still causing damage to the reputation of the police today as well as grief to families on the receiving end, he said. Fahy said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for a public inquiry into the policing of the miners\u2019 strike, not just Orgreave and the role of the police, but also the role of politicians. We need to look at the wider context of the way the police were used and the agenda set for them by government. Clearly it was about, in effect, national control of the police, in pursuit of a political agenda at the time. \u201cWe need to look at the way police in those communities were used as an army of occupation, created a culture of them and us \u2013 which people are concerned about at Hillsborough. The way the police force was used at that time helped to create a damaging culture. \u201cThe concern about Hillsborough is that the police saw it as an enforcement role and not public safety. If you are wondering how that came about, it\u2019s about the culture created in the 1980s, from the inner city riots, to the policing of the miners\u2019 strike, where the police then saw it as about enforcement and controlling role rather than a public safety role. Where did those attitudes [at Orgreave] come from? If you want to look at Orgreave you need to look at the wider context.\u201d Fahy\u2019s comments came as critics of the police action confronting workers at the Orgreave steel production coking plant in 1984 called on the new interim chief constable of South Yorkshire police to open up the force\u2019s archives. The challenge from the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign came the day after Dave Jones, chief constable of North Yorkshire police, marked the moment he took over temporary control of the South Yorkshire force by offering to listen to activists, as well as to the families of the 96 people who died in the Hillsborough football stadium disaster. Barbara Jackson, secretary for the campaign, said campaigners would take up the offer from Jones but said they did not want it to be a token gesture. She said they wanted the chief constable to intervene in their legal effort to persuade the home secretary, Theresa May, to hold a public inquiry into the events at Orgreave 32 years ago. Arthur Scargill, the politician and trade unionist who led the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984-85 miners\u2019 strike, and was arrested during the disturbances, has also called for a public inquiry into the events. The rare public intervention by Scargill, 78, came as the Yorkshire Post said it had seen redacted sections of an Independent Police Complaints Commission report that the paper said revealed that the same senior officers and solicitor were involved both in the aftermath of Orgreave and Hillsborough in 1989. South Yorkshire police referred itself to the IPCC in 2012 over allegations that officers colluded to write court statements relating to Orgreave. The IPCC later said the passage of time prevented a formal investigation but said there was support for the allegation that senior police exaggerated pickets\u2019 use of violence. The commission said on Tuesday it was now considering whether an unredacted version of the report could be made public. Jackson said: \u201cWe would be prepared to meet with Dave Jones if it\u2019s going to be a productive meeting, and not just a token gesture.\u201d The events of the \u201cBattle of Orgreave\u201d at the coking plant on the borders of Rotherham and Sheffield came to symbolise the miners\u2019 strike. Large numbers of pickets were confronted by about 6,000 police from across the UK. Police charged 95 miners following the disturbances but the workers\u2019 trial collapsed. Virtually all traces of the coking plant and the pit next to it have since been eradicated. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cAs I\u2019ve always said, we won\u2019t have the truth about Hillsborough until we have the full truth about Orgreave. Finally, this report provides proof of what has long been suspected \u2013 that underhand tactics were used first against South Yorkshire miners, before being deployed to much more deadly effect against Liverpool supporters.\u201d Burnham added: \u201cLike the people of Liverpool, the mining communities of South Yorkshire now need to be told the truth about their police force and the policing of the miners\u2019 strike. On the back of these revelations Theresa May must now order a disclosure process not just on Orgreave but on the policing of the miners\u2019 strike.\u201d The appointment of Jones follows the suspension of the South Yorkshire chief constable David Crompton, following the Hillsborough inquests, and the short-lived tenure of his deputy, Dawn Copley, who stood down from the temporary role after it emerged she was under investigation by her previous force for alleged misconduct. The Home Office said: \u201cThese powers are only to be used once an individual has been arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence. They are reactive in nature and should not negatively impact community relations.\u201d"
"19||Bill forcing people to prove nationality slammed as discriminatoryGovernment measures making people prove their nationality or face prosecution risk damaging community relations and are discriminatory, critics have warned. The Conservatives want to give police and immigration officers the power to order people who have been arrested to state their nationality and require those believed to be foreign nationals to produce their nationality documents, such as a passport. Failure to do so within 72 hours would become a criminal offence under the policing and crime bill currently going through parliament. The government\u2019s stated aim is to make it easier to remove foreign national offenders. But concerns have been raised by civil liberties groups, as well as some immigration and policing experts, that people will be targeted because of how they look, their accent and their skin colour. They also warn that Britons will be caught up under the measures, and if they come under suspicion, will be required to prove they are British. Sara Ogilvie, policy officer at Liberty, the civil rights organisation, said: \u201cThe only grounds on which police could decide someone might not be British are their appearance and their accent, so the very basis of this policy is discrimination. \u201cRequiring police to make clumsy assumptions and ask provocative questions about a person\u2019s nationality is a toxic recipe for race relations in our towns and cities. This policy should have no place in the criminal justice system and risks leading to unfair trials.\u201d Ogilvie warned it was a British version of a controversial US anti-immigrant law introduced in the state of Arizona and resembled a hated policy that was scrapped in Britain, the so-called \u201cSUS\u201d law, that poisoned race relations and was blamed for disorder. \u201cForcing people to declare their nationality on arrest and in court marks a disturbing return to the dark days of the SUS laws, and brings the widely-condemned divisiveness of Arizona\u2019s immigration law onto UK soil,\u201d she said. The government, in a note explaining the need for the measure, said: \u201cForeign nationals comprise 12% of the prison population in England and Wales. The government aims to remove as many foreign national offenders (FNOs) as quickly as possible to their home countries, to protect the public, to reduce costs and to free up spaces in prison. \u201cSuccessfully establishing identity early post\u2010arrest helps to facilitate overseas criminal records checks \u2010 if serious offending is revealed this can allow the Home Office to consider deportation action even in cases where an individual is released without charge.\u201d It adds: \u201c... successful identification is particularly difficult where an individual is not carrying a document at the time of arrest. Although it is already possible for officers to search premises for identity documents, this is resource intensive and to require officers to do so in every case would be a disproportionate use of police resources.\u201d Barrister Adrian Berry, chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association said: \u201cThere is a risk that visible differences will be the marker, leading to people from minority backgrounds being disproportionately challenged. \u201cMaking it a criminal offence for a person arrested to fail to produce a passport on demand or state a nationality is unnecessary, heavy handed and carries its own risks. A police officer need only suspect a person is not a British citizen to demand a passport.\u201d The head of a group representing serving police officers also expressed concerns. DS Janet Hills, chair of the National Black Policing Association, said: \u201cI want to see monitoring and accountability attached. There is likely to be the disproportionately, the over targeting of ethnic minorities.\u201d Lord Paddick, a former Scotland Yard chief, now Liberal Democrat spokesperson on home affairs in the House of Lords, said: \u201cThis is yet another measure likely to undo decades of work trying to rebuild police and community relations. \u201cIn the late 70s, when I was a PC, the way some officers dealt with difficult black youth on the street was to arrest them for being an over stayer. \u201cThis measure puts the police right back at the centre of enforcing immigration law.\u201d Paddick said it was not a measure police wanted to see. He also said it was a step towards identity cards: \u201cIf the police can require you to prove you are British, that is one stage short of identity cards.\u201d Berry added: \u201cAs a police officer need only suspect a person of a lack of nationality, British citizens as well as foreigners would be caught by the measure. Failure to produce a passport without a \u2018reasonable excuse\u2019 will be a criminal offence. \u201cThat is not a sufficient safeguard given that British citizens and others are not obliged to carry identity documents or passports when at liberty in the UK. The effect of the measure will be to make passports function as ID cards for both British citizens and foreigners.\u201d The home secretary, Theresa May, has criticised police for using stop and search powers disproportionately against ethnic minority communities, viewing it as damaging to trust in the police. The Conservatives hope to increase their share of the growing ethnic minority vote and believe action on issues such as stop and search will help their appeal with black and Asian Britons."
"9||Villarreal\u2019s Denis Su\u00e1rez ready to sink Liverpool with Yellow SubmarineCastell\u00f3n airport has never seen anything like this, which might not come as a huge surprise when for four long years it had never even seen a plane. Over the past two days the place has been busy for the first time, thanks to the first people to fly from there. In January 2015 the Villarreal team boarded flight YW2003 bound for San Sebasti\u00e1n; on Wednesday they caught a charter heading for Liverpool John Lennon, where a metal Yellow Submarine awaited them. History awaits them too, and more than 2,000 supporters followed from Vila Real, population 51,367. Three charter flights left Castell\u00f3n on Wednesday and six are scheduled for Thursday, more than normally take off there in a week. Others flew from Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid: fans, friends and family. Denis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s mother, a hairdresser, and his father, a car mechanic, came in from Galicia, north-west Spain. There are no direct flights but they were not going to miss seeing him in a European semi-final at Anfield. Nor was Su\u00e1rez\u2019s sister, Zulay, but at least she did not have to travel so far. She came by car. Su\u00e1rez signed for Manchester City in 2011, aged 17. He left Celta Vigo, who he supports and had joined at 11, because they were in administration and needed the money. Barcelona wanted him too but, he admits with striking honesty, there were two fundamental reasons to choose England: one was financial, the other family. \u201cCelta had to sell and City paid them an important amount [\u20ac1.5m up front, \u20ac1.5m more upon his debut], while the contract sorted out my parents\u2019 lives,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd, above all, City let me take my family with me.\u201d After two years in Manchester he returned to Spain and so did his parents. They went back to Salceda de Caselas, the town of 8,835 people where he grew up; Su\u00e1rez went to Barcelona, then Sevilla, then Villarreal. Zulay, though, stayed in Manchester where she runs a company called Forever Fit and where, Su\u00e1rez says with a smile, \u201cshe\u2019d got herself an English boyfriend\u201d. A City fan, he and Zulay planned to watch Wednesday\u2019s Champions League semi\u2011final with Denis in the Villarreal team\u2019s hotel and Thursday\u2019s Europa League semi\u2011final in the Villarreal end. Had things turned out differently, they might have watched him weekly at the Etihad Stadium. He could be forgiven for thinking that, given the chance, he would be in City\u2019s first team now. \u201cYes, maybe. But I don\u2019t regret any of the decisions I\u2019ve made.\u201d He has made a lot of them, while others have been made for him, leaving him seemingly forever moving on. \u201cMaybe in different circumstances I\u2019d be playing for City or Barcelona, or if Celta hadn\u2019t had financial problems I\u2019d still be there,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. \u201cBut you have to keep progressing, and every experience makes you stronger.\u201d Su\u00e1rez speaks in a soft voice, his words considered and thoughtful, but the ambition is inescapable, the character too \u2013 visible, too, in how much he\u2019s experienced so young, in his refusal to allow progress to slow, the search for opportunity. At 22 he has had five clubs and more lies ahead. A call-up to Spain\u2019s preliminary pre-Euro squad is likely and with Barcelona intending to exercise their right to buy him back, so is another move. It has been quite a journey and it started with a goal. \u201cIt was against Los Angeles Galaxy in pre-season,\u201d Su\u00e1rez recalls. \u201cI came on late and it went to penalties. I hadn\u2019t got the ball, so my first ever touch as a City player was a penalty ... which I scored.\u201d If Su\u00e1rez remembers the penalty \u2013 \u201cacross my body, the keeper going the wrong way\u201d \u2013 most remember that game for Roberto Mancini furiously hauling off Mario Balotelli after an attempted backheel. Su\u00e1rez was behind him on the bench at the time. \u201cMario heard a whistle from the stands,\u201d Su\u00e1rez explains. \u201cBut Mancini hadn\u2019t heard it and substituted him because he thought he was messing about. If Balotelli had been focused, if his head had been right, he\u2019d have been a great player, I\u2019m certain. I saw him do things in training that were la leche [the business]. But there was no maliciousness in him, nothing bad at all: it was just the way he is. He was like a kid, everything was funny, but he was a good guy.\u201d Su\u00e1rez says they all were. And Balotelli, who spoke Spanish, was among those who helped most in the first difficult weeks, along with Pablo Zabaleta and Mancini\u2019s sons Felippo and Andrea. Su\u00e1rez had his family around him, built a relationship with team-mates and learnt English. He admits it was harder for his parents, for whom life in England was \u201cnothing like\u201d Spain even though City \u201cdid all they could\u201d, but he insists: \u201cI liked it there; going was the right decision and I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d Nor, though, did he regret leaving. On the pitch, opportunities were few at the Etihad Stadium. Given his age, that was always likely, but Su\u00e1rez hoped for more and departed without having played a Premier League game. \u201cTo start with Mancini showed a lot of trust and faith in me, he gave me confidence and my debut [in the League Cup against Wolves], but the team was competing for titles, so it\u2019s hard to put in young players. In the second year an injury slowed me down. At the end of it [Manuel] Pellegrini arrived. I had a year left but I got the offer from Bar\u00e7a: a year with the B team, then the first team.\u201d What did Pellegrini say? \u201cTo stay,\u201d Su\u00e1rez replies. \u201cI always knew it would be difficult to get games, but...\u201d he says, looking for the right words. \u201cFor example, I see Arsenal play youth-teamers, or United with [Marcus] Rashford. I see teams give them opportunities, four or five games to see how they respond. At City that doesn\u2019t happen. Except now with [Kelechi] Iheanacho, they don\u2019t really back young players. I know it\u2019s difficult: City have a huge number of top-level players. They invest a lot of money in youth, look after them, give them everything they need to succeed, but at the hour of truth it\u2019s hard to take that next step.\u201d Will that change with Pep Guardiola? \u201cMaybe,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. \u201cBecause his philosophy is that if he sees a young player who is good enough, he backs him.\u201d Su\u00e1rez thinks English football would benefit from youth teams playing in the professional league, rather than a Reserves League, helping young players prepare for that step up. But, he adds: \u201cI also believe that to find out if someone is good enough, you have to try them. Arsenal do it, and it works. United do it. Liverpool have had [Raheem] Sterling, Suso, [Jordan] Ibe ... they\u2019ve been given opportunities.\u201d Su\u00e1rez saw his best opportunity lying elsewhere and in 2013 returned to Spain. \u201cFor a Spaniard, saying no to Barcelona is very difficult \u2013 even if you\u2019re at City,\u201d he says. Again, though, he found himself wanting more. He\u2019d sat through the final-year collapse of Mancini; now he arrived at Barcelona for that unsuccessful 2013-14 season under Tata Martino, a year that felt transitory even at the time. He starred for Barcelona\u2019s B team, finishing third in the Second Division, but got no first-team minutes. He did not expect to the following season, either, even when Luis Enrique arrived. Next stop: Sevilla on a two-year loan. Su\u00e1rez considered 46 games in his first top-flight season a success. But at the end of it, with Barcelona\u2019s Fifa ban making a recall impossible, he pushed for the chance to join Villarreal instead pleading with the Sevilla coach Unai Emery to let him go. Eventually, Villarreal paid Sevilla \u20ac3m and Barcelona \u20ac4m to buy him. The Catalans kept a buy-back clause, believed to be around \u20ac7m. \u201cHe\u2019s a good lad, but he said he\u2019d have more chance somewhere else,\u201d Emery admitted. He was right. Su\u00e1rez has played 31 league games, plus 12 times in the Europa League this season. When he rolled the ball across for Adri\u00e1n L\u00f3pez to score the last\u2011minute winner against Liverpool, it left him on the verge of a record for assists in this competition, with seven. It also left Villarreal on the verge of history. Su\u00e1rez has heard people say they celebrated too much, too soon, but he does not agree. And far from disrespecting Liverpool, he insists the opposite is true. \u201cLiverpool are a huge club, un grande. Imagine it: you beat a big, historic club in the Europa League semi-final, and in the last minute ... that doesn\u2019t happen every day.\u201d \u201cPeople know Atl\u00e9tico, Madrid, and Bar\u00e7a, and no one else exists. The game against Liverpool was our way of opening Villarreal up to the world, showcasing our identity and style, which you can see in the goal: a sharp, clean counterattack, a really good one,\u201d he says. As for Liverpool\u2019s style, he admits he was surprised to see them play without a striker but believes that what most effected them was losing Philippe Coutinho. Su\u00e1rez talks highly of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s tactical work and personality; talks highly, too, of two players who were team-mates at City. \u201cKolo [Tour\u00e9] is a great guy, always positive,\u201d he says, but it is James Milner of whom he speaks most warmly and whose shirt he covets. Milner, it turns out, even speaks a bit of Spanish. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s underrated in England; what I do know is that I saw him every day and he ran more and trained better than anyone else,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. \u201cI\u2019d always want him in my team and I\u2019m sure coaches think the same. He always competes. Maybe he is rarely a 10 out 10 but he\u2019s always a notable [7 or 8]. \u201cThe Europa League\u2019s taken a leap forward: you can see how teams like Dortmund and Liverpool have treated it, teams used to the Champions League,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. And not because it is a gateway, a means of returning to that competition, which Villarreal have already done in anyway, but because of the glory, the moment, the memory. \u201cIf it then gives you access to the Champions League, great, but it\u2019s a title, a trophy,\u201d he insists. That matters. As he explains: \u201cLiverpool have loads of titles [already], sure, but Sevilla have become big through the Europa League\u201d. Villarreal aspire to the same and so does he. For Su\u00e1rez, this would be his second trophy in two years, having won the competition with Sevilla last season; for Villarreal, defeated in three European semi-finals, it would be a first in 93 years. No wonder there were queues in Castell\u00f3n. \u201cWe\u2019re living a historic season,\u201d he says. \u201cFourth in La Liga, semi\u2011finals against Liverpool, winning 1-0, last minute. It\u2019s not that we celebrated as if we\u2019d already won; it\u2019s that maybe people don\u2019t realise how big this is for us. And it\u2019s Liverpool \u2013 come on. Any player would love the chance to reach a European final; imagine having that chance at Anfield. \u201cFor Villarreal, it doesn\u2019t get bigger. If we get through, this would be the most important season in the club\u2019s history.\u201d"
"0||Video shows Navy Seal's death was result of intense combat with IsisVideo footage obtained by the Guardian shows the grueling firefight between US special forces, Kurdish commandoes and Islamic State fighters this week, in which a US Navy Seal was killed. The footage \u2013 filmed on a cellphone during the battle, which lasted more than half a day \u2013 reveals the extent to which the US military is once again engaged in intense combat in Iraq. Provided to the Guardian by the lieutenant of an elite Kurdish peshmerga unit, the video shows a convoy of four by four vehicles coming under fire near Tel Osqof, a Christian town about 30km north of Mosul. Amid the crackle of gunfire, peshmerga fighters and at least six US troops take cover behind an unarmored pickup truck on an arterial road leading into the town. One of the Americans appears to be saying \u201cI don\u2019t have a gun\u201d, as another says, \u201cI have a gun over here.\u201d A peshmerga shouts: \u201cPlease save up your bullets.\u201d Another peshmerga fighter asks: \u201cCan we not ask for AK-47 bullets from the Americans?\u201d Lieutenant Saad, the peshmerga fighter who shot part of the footage, praised the US forces that aided the Kurds in repelling the Isis assault: \u201cIf it was not for the American firepower, we would have more casualties. They are really good fighters.\u201d Special Warfare Operator First Class Charles H Keating IV of San Diego, who hailed from Arizona, became the third US casualty of the latest US war in Iraq. In the video, a US Black Hawk helicopter with medical insignia is seen descending in an open field near a US and Kurdish position outside of the town before taking off again. While it is unclear if Keating was aboard the helicopter in the footage, a peshmerga fighter can be heard saying \u201cit has come to take away the wounded\u201d. After consulting with the Pentagon, the Guardian has decided to blur the visible faces of US forces at Tel Osqof. The initial description of Keating\u2019s death provided by US Central Command and the Pentagon said that he was was killed in northern Iraq \u201cas the result of enemy fire\u201d and behind the front lines. Ashton Carter, US defense chief, described Keating\u2019s death as \u201ca combat death, of course\u201d. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, also said Keating died a combat death, but characterized the overall mission in Iraq as something short of combat. \u201cOur men and women on the ground in Iraq do not have a combat mission, but they do have a dangerous mission to operate in a dangerous country,\u201d Earnest said. For years, the White House has argued that US troops in Iraq with adjuncts in Syria \u2013 officially 4,000 but often 5,500 at any given time \u2013 are an advisory force, not a combat force. Barack Obama, announcing a deployment of 250 more special-operations forces to Syria on 25 April, said: \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be leading the fight on the ground, but they will be essential in providing the training and assisting local forces that continue to drive [Isis] back.\u201d Yet details of the battle at Tel Osqof, provided on Wednesday both by frontline participants and the US military command in charge of the war against Isis, suggest that the suddenness and intensity of warfare can erode the distinctions between assistance and combat. Colonel Steve Warren, the spokesman for the command operating the war against Isis, said that Keating was part of a quick reaction force (QRF) spooled up in support of a US \u201cadvise and assist\u201d mission that \u201cjust happened to be in that village\u201d meeting with peshmerga leaders at Tel Osqof, less than four km behind the front. From there, the US advisers fought alongside the peshmerga in a gun battle with what Warren said were at least 125 Isis fighters. \u201cOur forces automatically became embroiled in the ensuing battle,\u201d Warren said, and called in the QRF. \u201cIt was a big fight, one of the largest we\u2019ve seen recently.\u201d Warren said that the mission of QRF force Keating was a part of was not to reinforce the US fighting positions, but to extricate the Americans from the fight. \u201cThat\u2019s why the QRF went, to help extract them. It was a big fight. They were in contact [with the enemy], they couldn\u2019t get away. So the QRF came to help ensure they were able to get away,\u201d Warren told reporters. After being wounded by small-arms fire, Keating was successfully evacuated by Black Hawk helicopter to a medical facility in Irbil, the Iraqi Kurdish capitol, but his wounds proved fatal. Warren, who called Keating an \u201cAmerican hero\u201d, said that Isis fired on the US helicopters but did not disable them. Warren said \u201cour guys got out of there relatively rapidly\u201d but specified that the fight at Tel Osqof lasted over half a day. Thirteen US warplanes, including two drones, launched 31 airstrikes, the battle continued at least into 9.30pm, Warren said. The Isis attack on peshmerga positions at Tel Osqof was multi-pronged and came as an apparent surprise. Before 6am on Tuesday, Isis militants bridged a peshmerga trench and crossed into territory held by the Kurdish forces. \u201cIn the past, when they attacked, they tried to fill up the trench beyond our berms with a bulldozer, but this time was different,\u201d said a Kurdish officer, Major Ibrahim, who has fought Isis since August 2014. \u201cThere was a convoy of Isis humvees and there was a mobile bridge in a truck.\u201d At least 10 peshmerga were killed and up to 30 were wounded while almost all the Isis militants in the 20 vehicles that breached the front line died. Peshmerga captured at least three US-made Humvees that Isis had itself captured from the Iraqi military in 2014. US aircraft including F-15 and F-16 fighter jets, B-52 bombers, A-10 close air support aircraft and drones launched airstrikes on more than 30 locations, destroying another 20 Isis vehicles, including a bulldozer. Warren put the Isis death toll at 58. When the Guardian visited the town on Wednesday, at least four mangled bodies were still on display in Tel Osqof. Houses with shattered windows were marked by bullet holes in their facades. Crushed packages of US ammunition littered the roads. Dlovan Jaffar, a peshmerga fighter, took part in close combat with Isis on Tel Osqof\u2019s streets. Standing by a mangled corpse of an Isis militant on Wednesday, Jaffar said the Isis Humvees had advanced despite a hail of rocket-propelled grenades fired by the peshmerga. \u201cWe cornered three Isis militants inside a house, but then one of them blew himself up killing the other two,\u201d Jaffar said. The Americans, he said, fought outside the town, alongside elite peshmerga fighters. \u201cI saw an American helicopter that touched down near the entrance to the town,\u201d he said. General Wahid Kovali, the leader of an elite peshmerga counter-terrorism unit that fought alongside the US forces, said the Seals and others fought heroically. \u201cThey were very good fighters, but they also had good guns,\u201d said Kovali, whose forces are on the front berm across from Isis-held Iraqi territory. \u201cIt was a bad day for us here yesterday,\u201d Warren said, claiming that Isis launched the offensive to distract attention from recent territorial losses in northern Iraq. Warren disputed that the US-led war against Isis, which will enter its third year this summer, is becoming more of a combat mission. \u201cOur mission remains to advise, assist, train [and] equip our partner forces, both here in Iraq and in Syria. That really continues to be our primary mission,\u201d Warren said."
"0||And then there was one: Trump stands alone after shocking nomination raceDonald Trump has finally secured a clear path to the Republican presidential nomination as his last remaining party rival signalled he would drop out of the race on Wednesday. Governor John Kasich of Ohio will formally quit the race with a statement in his home state at 5pm, following Texas senator Ted Cruz by stepping aside for Trump. The sudden capitulation sets up a November battle between Trump and Hillary Clinton for the White House, even though Bernie Sanders stayed alive in the Democratic race with a surprise win on Tuesday night in the Indiana primary. Kasich\u2019s withdrawal, confirmed to the Guardian by a senior campaign source, marks the formal end of the most crowded and controversial race for a US presidential nomination in modern political history. The decision, made while Kasich\u2019s plane was waiting on the tarmac at Columbus airport ahead of a planned fundraising trip, followed a similar announcement by his better-placed opponent Ted Cruz, who suspended his own campaign at an emotional press conference in Indiana on Tuesday night. \u201cFrom the beginning I\u2019ve said I will continue on as long as there is a viable path to victory \u2013 tonight I am sorry to say it appears that math has been foreclosed,\u201d said Cruz. As the crowd shouted \u201cno, no\u201d, Cruz told attendees: \u201cTogether we left it out on the field. We gave it everything we got. But the voters chose another path, and so with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation we are suspending our campaign.\u201d Using the word \u201csuspension\u201d to describe such decisions is typically a technicality designed to preserve a candidate\u2019s legal ability to continue raising funds while the campaign winds up. Both Cruz and Kasich bowed to the near mathematical certainty that Trump will now win a clear majority of delegates, reaching the 1,237 threshold needed to clinch the nomination. And they also acknowledged calls by the Republican National Committee to unite around the \u201cpresumptive nominee\u201d. But the scale of the political reconciliation required for this to happen was made clear on Wednesday when Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire \u2013 one of several moderate senators facing a bumpy re-election with Trump at the top of the party ballot in November \u2013 said she would be \u201csupporting, but not endorsing\u201d his candidacy. Arizona senator John McCain, another previously vocal opponent of Trump, said he would support the party\u2019s nominee, but initially declined to refer to him directly by name. A former speechwriter for McCain, who was the party nominee in 2008, said he would rather vote for Hillary Clinton than Trump. Many party leaders, including opponents in the primary, will now be under similar pressure to announce their support for Trump, despite months of public misgivings about his lack of political experience, attacks on women and minorities, and poor polling numbers among independent voters. Despite fervent support among Republican primary votes, Trump suffers from the worst national opinion poll ratings of any candidate of either party since at least 1984, with 67% of Americans thinking of him unfavorably. Earlier on Wednesday, despite barely registering in Indiana, where he had encouraged supporters to vote for Cruz, Kasich issued a defiant statement suggesting he would continue to contest remaining primary elections. Taking his cue from the \u201cMay the Fourth\u201d Star Wars celebration, Kasich released a spoof video to the film\u2019s theme tune describing a nightmare scenario for Republicans in which Trump\u2019s nomination ushers not just a Clinton landslide, but allows Democrats to win back control of the House of Representatives and Senate. \u201cThe country is depending on Indiana,\u201d added Cruz on Tuesday before the primary results came in. \u201cIf Indiana does not act, this country could well plunge into the abyss \u2026 We are not a proud, boastful, self-centered, mean-spirited, hateful, bullying nation.\u201d But Trump swept his opponents before him in the Hoosier State, clinching 53% of the votes and almost all the delegates as his strident attacks on free trade agreements and immigration appeared to resonate in a midwest state hit hard by globalisation. The New York billionaire is almost certain to face Clinton in November\u2019s election, but voters in Indiana also showed her difficulties in fighting this economic populism. Her Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders threw a last-minute hurdle in front of Clinton\u2019s march toward the Democratic party nomination on Tuesday by clinching a surprise victory in the Indiana primary. Despite trailing by an average of seven points in opinion polls and losing a string of bigger, more diverse states on the east coast, Sanders once again proved his appeal to disaffected midwest voters by pulling off his 18th victory of 2016, winning 52.7% of the votes to Clinton\u2019s 47.3%. \u201cThe Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cThey\u2019re wrong. Maybe it\u2019s over for the insiders and the party establishment, but the voters in Indiana had a different idea.\u201d Nonetheless, the former secretary of state is nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of her Vermont rival and within less than 200 delegates of crossing the finish line including the controversial superdelegates \u2013 party figures who are able to vote independently of election results and overwhelmingly back Clinton. Choosing to focus on her Republican opponent, Clinton pointedly ignored the surprise Sanders upset in favor of a full frontal attack on Trump. \u201cChip in now if you agree we can\u2019t let him become president,\u201d she urged her supporters in a swift fundraising email. And later on Wednesday, Clinton took to Twitter to unveil a new \u201cLove trumps hate\u201d slogan, declaring: \u201cUnity versus division, compassion versus selfishness and love versus hate. The stakes don\u2019t get much higher.\u201d"
"20||Beyonc\u00e9 the latest to criticize North Carolina's 'bathroom bill'Beyonc\u00e9 released a statement critical of North Carolina\u2019s so-called \u201cbathroom bill\u201d the day after she performed in the state. In March, lawmakers pushed through House Bill 2 (HB2), which makes it impossible for any local government in the state to create protections for LGBT people. It also requires public buildings to post signs that say people are only allowed to use bathrooms that match their biological sex. \u201cAs the Formation World Tour makes its stop in the Tar Heel state in the midst of such a controversial time, we think it is important for us to bring attention to those who are committed to being good and carrying on the message of equality in this core of controversy,\u201d a statement on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s website said. The statement also called on people to support the work of Equality NC, which fights for the rights of LGBT North Carolina residents. Because HB2 was shuttled through the legislature in just one day, it was not subject to the debate traditionally held for state laws. But the new law has faced intense criticism from businesses, civil liberties advocates and musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, who cancelled his scheduled concert in North Carolina in protest against the law. North Carolina\u2019s governor, Pat McCrory, who signed the legislation on 23 March, dismissed the backlash as \u201cpolitical correctness gone amok\u201d. A coalition of civil liberties groups and LGBT North Carolinians have filed a federal lawsuit against the state over HB2, claiming that the law violates the constitution\u2019s equal protection clause. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation tour stop in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Tuesday was temporarily postponed because of bad weather. The tour began in Miami late last month, just after the surprise release of her new album, Lemonade."
"18||David Cameron will not retract criticism of Donald Trump, No 10 saysDavid Cameron has no intention of withdrawing his claim that Donald Trump was \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong\u201d to call for a ban on Muslims entering the US, Downing Street has said. Despite Trump\u2019s likely confirmation as the Republican presidential candidate, a spokesman for Cameron said the prime minister stood by his comments made in December last year. It comes after George Papadopoulos, an adviser to Trump, told the Times on Wednesday that he thought Cameron should reach out with an apology or some sort of retraction. Asked whether Cameron stuck by the comments, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had \u201cno intention of withdrawing his comments, which were made in response to comments that Donald Trump made calling for a ban on Muslims entering the US, that was the context for the PM\u2019s comments\u201d. No 10 said there would be contact with the Republican and Democrat presidential campaigns, but no plans in the diary for Cameron to meet Trump. Cameron previously met Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate, when he was running in 2012. Papadopoulos said Cameron\u2019s comments were uncalled-for and it would be wise for the prime minister to \u201creach out in a more positive manner\u201d to the Republican frontrunner. Asked if Trump would forgive the remarks, he said: \u201cI can\u2019t speak directly for him, but it would seem that if Prime Minister Cameron is serious about reaching out, not only to Mr Trump\u2019s advisers but to the man himself, an apology or some sort of retraction should happen. \u201cTo see Mr Cameron come out as the most vocal opponent was uncalled for. Considering that we believe that the UK-US relationship should be a cornerstone, not just of Nato policy but elsewhere, it would be wise for him to reach out in a more positive manner to Mr Trump.\u201d Cameron previously said he had nothing to add or subtract from his remarks when asked about them at a joint press conference with the US president, Barack Obama, in the Foreign Office last month. But he has repeatedly declined further invitations to comment on Trump\u2019s chances, saying the election is a matter for the American people."
"3||BBC hits back at government report claiming it doesn't take enough risksA leaked BBC document has criticised a government report into the corporation\u2019s market impact by pointing out that making shows that are less successful and popular than Strictly Come Dancing would not be good for licence fee payers. The BBC document suggests that the report commissioned by the government uses \u201cflawed\u201d analysis and \u201cquestionable\u201d assumptions that put commercial impact above the need of the audience. It goes so far as to suggest that the government report is simply a rehash of its rivals\u2019 views. \u201cMuch of the report\u2019s analysis seems to restate evidence included in ITV\u2019s and commercial radio\u2019s submissions to the charter review consultation.\u201d The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) report, written by management consultants Oliver and Ohlbaum and published in March, was particularly critical of BBC1, which it said had become \u201cless innovative and less risk-taking\u201d. In a speech in March following the publication of the report, culture secretary John Whittingdale called for a \u201cmore distinctive\u201d BBC. Over the weekend, the scheduling of hit shows such as Strictly and Great British Bake Off once again emerged as a bone of contention for providing overly competitive primetime programming. It was reported that Whittingdale would ban the BBC from going head to head with commercial rivals as part of the BBC charter review. Whittingdale is due to publish a white paper within weeks that will set out a tougher regime as part of a new royal charter to safeguard the service for another 11 years. A source at the BBC said the public would be deeply concerned if it were forced to move programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing, Doctor Who and Sherlock from primetime weekend slots. The BBC document, which is understood to have been sent to the DCMS ahead of next week\u2019s white paper on the corporation, disputed many of the Oliver and Ohlbaum findings, particularly on distinctiveness and market impact. If adopted in a government white paper on charter renewal expected next week, the BBC would fail as a universal service, it states, going on to say that the BBC\u2019s weekly reach would fall from 97% currently to less than 90% if the proposals were adopted. This would not make a \u201csensible basis for policy decisions about the future of the BBC\u201d and its universal service, it concluded. The DCMS-commissioned report was particularly critical of BBC1. In its response, the BBC stated: \u201cThe facts do not support the report\u2019s claim that BBC One has become less distinctive. They demonstrate the opposite.\u201d Criticised for showing too much entertainment and not enough new shows during daytime, the BBC said the volume of entertainment on BBC TV had fallen from 1,249 hours to 1,139 hours since 2007, the start of the last charter period. In peaktime on BBC1, hours of entertainment fell from 183 hours to 167 in the seven years to 2014. It also found that BBC1\u2019s daytime schedule included 19 new titles compared with 11 on ITV. The government report published in March concluded that broadcasting fewer populist shows on channels such as BBC1 and Radio 1 could benefit commercial rivals by as much as \u00a3115m a year. The DCMS commissioned the assessment of the BBC\u2019s \u201cmarket impact and distinctiveness\u201d to help it make \u201cinformed choices\u201d about the way the BBC should operate in its next royal charter period from 2017, which suggests that it will influence the white paper."
"1||Alaska plane struck bald eagle before crash in first ever fatal collisionA small plane hit a bald eagle before it crashed just north of Anchorage, Alaska, last month, killing all four people on board. An investigator said it is the nation\u2019s first civilian plane crash to result in deaths after an impact with a bald eagle. Shaun Williams with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said there have been other crashes involving eagle strikes that resulted in serious injuries, not deaths. The pilot, co-pilot and two passengers died when the plane went down on 20 April near a small airport about 20 miles north of Anchorage. Williams says an unknown substance was later found on the aircraft. Analysis at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC determined some of it was feathers and other materials that came from an immature bald eagle. According to the Alaska Dispatch News, one of the pilots was a 64-year-old former investigator who previously worked for the NTSB, an independent federal agency that investigates every civil aviation accident."
"2||David Cameron calls for political courage to seal TTIP dealDavid Cameron has said a trade deal between the EU and US is not dead despite France threatening to veto the proposal in its current form. The prime minister said it would take \u201cpolitical courage to get it over the line\u201d but the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would be good for British people. He insisted TTIP was still viable despite Fran\u00e7ois Hollande saying on Tuesday that he would reject it \u201cat this stage\u201d because France was opposed to unregulated free trade. All 28 EU member states and the European parliament would have to ratify TTIP before it comes into force, after 13 rounds of negotiations spread over nearly three years. Barack Obama has said completing TTIP with the EU is a priority for his country, and that in the event of Brexit the UK would have to go to the back of the queue for a trade deal. The proposed deal has gained in prominence over recent months as some Eurosceptics claim the UK could put a halt to it by leaving the EU. Campaigners against TTIP, who include the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and groups such as Greenpeace, argue that it could lead to weakening of regulation and open up the NHS to more privatisation. Cameron said concern over the possible impact on the NHS and public services was \u201cthe reddest of red herrings\u201d. \u201cThe health service is completely protected under this agreement as it is under other agreements,\u201d he told the Commons. \u201cLook, there are all sorts of reasons people might be against free trade and wanting to see an expansion of trade and investment and jobs. I think people should be honest about it and say they don\u2019t want to see these things happen, rather than actually finding total red herrings for getting in the way of what could add tens of billions of pounds to our economy and bring jobs and investment to our country.\u201d He later confirmed that the UK was still pushing for the completion of TTIP. During a session of the Commons liaison committee, Cameron was taken to task by Eurosceptic Tories including Bernard Jenkin and Bill Cash. Jenkin warned the prime minister to \u201cexpect a writ\u201d if the government kept posts making the case for Britain to remain in the EU on its website right up until the referendum. Jenkin said it would be illegal to keep pages on the Gov.uk website during the so-called purdah period in the last few weeks of the campaign. \u201cExpect a letter before action. If we can raise the funds, expect a writ,\u201d he said. Cameron replied: \u201cI\u2019d better get back to the office fast then.\u201d During the lengthy session, Cameron brushed off claims by the Brexit campaign that staying in the EU could lead to a wave of migration from Turkey. \u201cI will be absolutely frank with you, I don\u2019t think the accession of Turkey to the European Union is remotely on the cards. I don\u2019t think it will happen for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at the facts, the facts are that it requires unanimity of all European members. The French, for instance, have said they\u2019d have a referendum on it. \u201cI would say very clearly to people: if your vote in this referendum is being influenced by considerations about Turkish membership of the EU, don\u2019t think about it. It\u2019s not remotely on the cards. It\u2019s not an issue in this referendum and it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d He suggested it would be safer to stay in the EU to avoid the risk of the UK being broken up through a second independence referendum. \u201cI would argue to anyone in the United Kingdom who cares as passionately as I do about keeping the United Kingdom together that the safe and sensible choice is to vote to stay in a reformed European Union,\u201d Cameron said."
"15||We need the Women\u2019s Equality party \u2013 we\u2019ll see driverless cars before equal payNow is not the time to vote for equality, apparently; there are more important issues to consider. Women can always wait. After some glorious revolution, \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d will be attended to. I have heard this all my life, and I am hearing it again now when I talk of my support for the Women\u2019s Equality party (WEP). Comrades have informed me that the WEP is a single-issue party and that women are a \u201cminority interest\u201d. It is amazing to me that we will see driverless cars before we see equal pay, that whenever women speak up we are told this is not the right time and that we are not representative enough, often by those inhabiting political spaces entirely dominated by men. The Women\u2019s Equality party is actually Britain\u2019s fastest-growing party, with 45,000 members, though it only came into being a year ago through a of mixture of impatience and hope. As soon as the idea was floated, its founders were inundated with emails from people who wanted in. Some have not been engaged in politics for years, some are totally fed up with the traditional parties, some are seasoned campaigners, some are teenagers. So the idea became a reality fast. It was impressive to see a party forming. This involved a phenomenal amount of work, from funding to writing a constitution, creating a party structure and coordinating the branches that sprang up spontaneously all over the county. The phrase \u201cIf you want something done, ask a busy woman\u201d has never been more apt. It has been a steep learning curve from somewhat giddy meetings to fielding candidates. Mistakes have been made, but the commitment to doing something new is real. Our core objectives are: equal representation in business, industry and politics; equal pay; equal parenting; equality in the education system; equal treatment by and in the media; and an end to violence against women. This may sound like very basic stuff, but we are a long way off from achieving it and although the other parties have \u201cequality\u201d polices, they don\u2019t enact them. Our concerns are not the concerns of a handful of liberal feminists \u2013 yes, I have heard all the \u201cIt\u2019s just ladies who lunch\u201d criticism \u2013 because to achieve any of our goals requires a fundamental shake-up. To change the way childcare is structured; to understand that care is not some \u201cunproductive\u201d bit of the economy; to ask why, when austerity hit, it was women in the frontline; or see domestic violence services being run down; to watch George Osborne casually impoverishing a generation of women by putting up the pension age \u2013 all these things require us to see how the current economic analysis works against the most vulnerable. Many will argue that all this can only be tackled within existing party structures, to which I can only say: why hasn\u2019t it been? Why is gender equality continually pushed to the bottom of the agenda? From the outset, the WEP insisted it was going to do politics differently. We would be non-partisan and work with any other party where we could find common ground. This has been an education in breaking down some of politics\u2019 stultifying tribalism and has allowed us to draw on vast experience and expertise. Another achievement is to help our candidates with bursaries for childcare because many women cannot afford to enter public life. This is walking it like we talk it. Still, I know, we are too radical for some, not radical enough for others. My own view is we will be part of a coalition of forces that exists outside of Westminster politics pushing for change. The Westminster lot remain sneery, though, unable to see that many women don\u2019t vote at all. One of the surprises has been the big support from men. On the doorstep, WEP canvassers have been met with: \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d A big part of what we are about is shifting the conversation and that\u2019s why we are not simply a pressure group. Only when you threaten to take votes do other parties respond. Sadiq Khan and Zac Goldsmith, for instance, have had to field questions about what they will do about London\u2019s rape figures or the huge pay gap in a way that is unprecedented because of WEP\u2019s presence. Also unprecedented is the diversity of our candidates. In our London list we have 30% BAME and 30% LGBT. We know we have to act intersectionally. We know there is more than one kind of discrimination and we know that many may share our aims but cannot give us all their votes so, strangely enough, we are not asking for them. Just half of them. In London, you get four votes, so give us two. On the orange ballot paper, help us get us on the Greater London Assembly. In Scotland and Wales, give one of your two votes on the party list. In 2016, it is extraordinary that we have to vote to push basic equality to the top of the agenda instead of paying it lip service, but we do. Progress has stalled. We are the start-up."
"9||Claudio Ranieri has rediscovered himself at Leicester, says his motherClaudio Ranieri\u2019s mother has admitted the Leicester manager has \u201crediscovered himself\u201d in England and lifted the lid on what they had for lunch on the day her son\u2019s side became Premier League champions. In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Renata Ranieri revealed that she had burst into tears when Eden Hazard\u2019s equaliser for Chelsea against Tottenham at Stamford Bridge ensured Leicester had won their first league title. While the entire team assembled at Jamie Vardy\u2019s house to watch the Chelsea match on Monday, Ranieri flew to Rome for lunch with his 96-year-old mother before returning to England. \u201cWe had some steak with chicory. Before leaving, he ate strawberries with lemon and sugar,\u201d Renata said. \u201cMy son has to keep himself in shape, so he rarely asks for a starter. He talked about Leicester a bit, but wanted to relax. He was with me for two hours, then said the president of his team had organised a plane to take him back to England. We said goodbye and he went towards the Ciampino airport.\u201d She added: \u201cAt the final whistle I burst into tears. I only heard from Claudio later because first my grandchildren and my son\u2019s cousins called. He was so happy. We all are. Now we can finally relax. \u201cI watched every game, it was a continual series of emotions. He calls me every evening and kept me up to date on everything. This morning I bought the sports papers and saw the headlines. It was satisfying. \u201cI have to admit, I did not expect him to win with Leicester. He found these players \u2026 they are good lads. He told me they always trained as real professionals. \u201cNaturally it wasn\u2019t a big squad full of champions. I know that he\u2019s happy in England, they always treated him perfectly. He rediscovered himself there.\u201d Ranieri spent 18 months at his hometown club, Roma, but resigned in February 2011 after falling out with club officials. Renata believes success in England has allowed her son to finally put that disappointment behind him. \u201cIn my view, at Roma he was not treated with respect. In the family we are all Giallorossi fans, so when Claudio was there we were also guests at Trigoria [the training ground],\u201d she said. \u201cWe were disappointed with the way things ended. Look, he won his own scudetto here too, because he went really close, but he arrived after the season had already started. Now he\u2019s \u2018King of England\u2019, imagine that.\u201d"
"7||Sam Warburton expected to be fit for Wales\u2019 tour of New ZealandSam Warburton should be fit to lead Wales on their three-Test tour to New Zealand next month after an examination of his right shoulder, which he injured playing for Cardiff Blues against Ospreys last weekend, revealed the damage was minor. The Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, will name his squad for the tour, which is preceded by another trip to Twickenham to face England, next week and while Warburton will not play for the Blues in the final match of the campaign against Edinburgh this weekend, he is expected to be fit to take on the World Cup holders. The Blues head coach, Danny Wilson, said: \u201cSam is going through an assessment after spraining an AC joint in his right shoulder. I do not know how long he will be out for. A lot of these injuries depend on the person involved and their professionalism and diligence to get back. Sam will do everything he needs to get back to fitness and my understanding is that it is a minor, short-term injury that means he has every opportunity of making the Wales tour. I do not see there being a major issue with that.\u201d Wales are visiting New Zealand, who will be starting life without cornerstones of their team for the last decade, Richie McCaw, Dan Carter, Ma\u2019a Nonu, Conrad Smith and Tony Woodcock, one year before the Lions fly out. Warburton captained the Lions on their last tour, to Australia in 2013, and his fitness will be important to Wales as his rival for the openside position for the last three years, Justin Tipuric, is continuing to recover from a head injury he sustained in the final round of the Six Nations that meant even watching television gave him a headache. He has been told to take the summer off. Meanwhile, wing George North says he was tempted to go for the 2016 Rio Olympics sevens team but is instead likely to concentrate on recovery. \u201cYes, obviously [I was tempted], but in the grand scheme of things I\u2019m a 15s player. For me, more for the longevity of my career, it would be better to take a few weeks away, rest up and get ready for next season.\u201d"
"11||Blame it on the Zodiac killer: did social media ruin Ted Cruz's campaign?When Ted Cruz dropped out of the Republican presidential race after losing in Indiana, he said there was no \u201cviable path to victory\u201d. But, really, anybody who isn\u2019t a Republican would probably tell you something different: it was the handshake. And probably also that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac killer. This Vine of Cruz fumbling toward a \u201ctriumphant\u201d hand clasp with running mate Carly Fiorina has been viewed more than 3.5m times (even though we assume most people viewed it more than once). It\u2019s been edited from the original video to highlight the strangeness: tendril fingers slithering and grasping awkwardly for each other, like Cthulhu hand puppets. It takes an unbearably long time for the pair to get their fists into the air. There are so many incarnations of the original moment constellating across Twitter, Facebook and other platforms that it\u2019s impossible to track its penetration \u2013 but empirically, it\u2019s quite difficult to avoid. It\u2019s probably absurd to assume that one internet meme could end someone\u2019s political career. But what about lots of them? \u201cSkewered by social media memes\u201d is the essential story of the Cruz campaign, and the gleeful and prolific satires of the ordinary citizens\u2019 online community surely played a role in exaggerating the candidate\u2019s inherent strangeness, sketching him as a grotesque figure vulnerable to his rivals. Aside from the persistent and fascinating Zodiac killer meme galleries, here are 13 characters and animals that purportedly look like Cruz, including a blobfish, Grandpa Munster, the Penguin from Batman, and \u201cdogs stung by bees\u201d. Let\u2019s add one more: this famous drawing of France\u2019s King Louis Philippe, in a political cartoon by Honore Daumier dating all the way back to 1803. The unflattering lithograph, called Gargantua, was a protest of corruption and was obscene for its time, depicting Philippe gobbling bags of gold that flow uphill to his gaping mouth. The artist was jailed for his trouble \u2013 but the work remains an example of the early impact of political cartoons, which came into their own as a form during the 1800s. For the first time in a US election cycle, community-generated memes have grown to play a significant role in political discourse, similar to the classic printed cartoon. The anarchic, youth-led online shorthand \u2013 which can encompass images with text captions, familiar iconography repurposed in multiple contexts, or even short animations such as gifs and Vines \u2013 is no longer just for young people on image boards and in closed groups. In fact, it may even be a sign of how politically engaged young people are today: they\u2019re generating their own image-based political satires. In these memes, the political figure is exaggerated, his context made grotesque or fantastical, just as in traditional political cartooning. If we agree that memes have played some role, even a small one, in dispossessing the Cruz campaign of dignity, then we can also look at how memes have helped rally disenfranchised youth around progressive candidate Bernie Sanders. A Facebook group called Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash (where \u201cdank\u201d is an ironic synonym for cool) has close to 450,000 members devoted mostly to pro-Sanders memes \u2013 and to those skewering Cruz, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in mostly equal measure. One of the most popular meme formats that went viral thanks to the group is called \u201cBernie or Hillary?\u201d, which depicts a fake campaign poster comparing the two candidates\u2019 stances on popular culture topics: Bernie is usually depicted as being relatable or knowledgeable on the issue, while Hillary gives an embarrassing stock answer. Hillary believes the Olive Garden is \u201cAn authentic Italian restaurant for the whole family\u201d while Bernie\u2019s view is \u201cOnly when I\u2019m high.\u201d My personal favorite incarnation depicts Bernie with a traditional Royal Dansk tin full of actual butter cookies, while Hillary classically uses hers to hold sewing equipment. It\u2019s so subtle, recapturing the childhood disappointment of finding something boring instead of a treat. The memes are funny, but they\u2019re also precise and insightful caricatures of actual reservations regarding one liberal candidate versus another. Ultimately the community is more than a humor group; the idiosyncratic satirist CARLES not-so-jokingly suggested that Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash could be \u201ca safe haven for those who need reinforcement from non-establishment media streams\u201d. According to the online meme library Know Your Meme, the Bernie Sanders Dank Meme Stash was created in October 2015 by college students Will Dowd and Sean Walsh. Meme scientist Ari Spool, who spent many years researching and cataloguing memes at Know Your Meme (though she recently joined Giphy as community curator), has studied the BSDMS closely and notes that age polls that take place in the group seem to suggest participants \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d volunteer their age as 18 to 21. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different generation than those who voted for Obama the first time,\u201d she says. \u201cThese kids don\u2019t remember 9/11; all they have felt were aftershocks, and the effects on their older siblings, the millennials. Our college debt is something they see and understand the full breadth of before they even get into a school, and our difficulty in finding quality work is something they see, too. Let\u2019s not even get started on institutional racism; I didn\u2019t have a newsfeed in high school but they do, and it\u2019s making them \u2018woke af\u2019.\u201d The engagement around memes as political cartoons may even suggest a more passionate youth vote than ever. \u201cYoung people are incredibly engaged in political speech, but they are very often thwarted by a system that refuses to support them physically. \u2026 You have to show up in person to vote, the system favors the old and stable over the young and unstable,\u201d says Spool, who once campaigned for mayor in New York City. \u201cI think if you analyze what these memes are saying about Bernie, it\u2019s that people are excited because he doesn\u2019t reflect the system that\u2019s currently in place.\u201d Nonetheless, there are memes alternately celebrating and denigrating any candidate; the Texts From Hillary meme, in contrast to the tenor of the BSDMS, uses an image of Clinton wearing sunglasses and texting to present her as competent and in charge (\u201cHi Hil, whatchu doing,\u201d Obama texts; \u201cRunning the world,\u201d she replies). There\u2019s even a Ted Cruz Meme Page that up until now has been dedicated to earnestly pro-Cruz memes (Keep Calm and Cruz On is one) but as of the candidate\u2019s exit is devoted to anti-Trump ones. These new communal political cartoons are a clear component of the present landscape \u2013 though their impact is harder to quantify (while Facebook networks swelled with anti-Trump memes and disturbing gifs, he imperviously became the presumptive Republican nominee). \u201cThe meme universe is all about mutability, and the flexibility to express your opinion,\u201d Spool says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Bernie and Hillary, but whatever the other element in the meme is. That\u2019s what makes it fun.\u201d"
"2||Expanded recall for deadly Takata airbags to impact one in four US carsUS regulators have more than doubled the recall of Takata airbag inflators to include tens of millions more cars, making the order the largest automotive recall in history. The inflators, meant to save people in the event of a crash, are prone to explode, expelling fragments of metal. Some 63.8m cars are affected in the US \u2013 equivalent to more than a quarter of the vehicles on US roads. As of Wednesday morning the inflators were known to have killed a dozen people \u2013 11 in the US and one in Malaysia \u2013 and hurt more than 100 others. At a press conference in Washington on Wednesday afternoon, however, National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHSTA) administrator Mark Rosekind said he had learned from Honda that two more people had been killed by the faulty auto part in Malaysia in the past three weeks. In Houston, Texas last month, a teenage girl was killed in a minor collision that triggered the airbag, when the Takata inflator exploded. \u201cPlease,\u201d Rosekind asked reporters, \u201cas you report your stories, include this. Vehicle owners who have received notice that there are parts available for their repair should take action immediately.\u201d Makes and models affected are listed in a special page on the NHSTA website or by vehicle identification number. The models from the expanded recall are not included yet, according to the regulator\u2019s guide, but users can sign up for an alert tailored to the car they own. NHSTA has said the top priority for replacing airbags goes to \u201chigh absolute humidity\u201d areas across the American south-east and island territories and encouraged car owners to keep checking the page. Over time, humid conditions can alter the composition of ammonium nitrate and a trying agent, chemicals that react to deploys of the air bag and increase the likelihood of an explosion. Ruptures are much less likely in new vehicles. The recall already affects 28.8m cars in the US; the NHSTA said it had fixed 8.17m of the faulty products as of 22 April. The accelerated recall adds between 35m and 40m new cars to the list, Rosekind said. \u201cI\u2019m going to make this personal: my family has a vehicle with a Takata inflator sitting in the driveway,\u201d said Rosekind. \u201cWe are checking weekly to see when those parts are going to be available.\u201d The defect does not affect all the Takata inflators, but Rosekind urged consumers to try to find \u201cloaner\u201d cars where they could. Ordering companies to provide temporary replacements is beyond his remit. \u201cI have looked at it every which way,\u201d he said. \u201cNHTSA has no authority to require loaners to be made available.\u201d Part of the problem lies in creating a design for a new inflator that will not blow up. \u201cWhere we could push, we\u2019ve pushed as quickly as we can with the caveat that we can\u2019t push too hard without running the risk of a new design for an inflator that\u2019s not safe,\u201d Rosekind said. Stock in the Japanese manufacturer was down 9.25% on Wednesday, following news of the expanded recall. The problem now is that the models of car under recall are so numerous that the replacement of all dangerous parts is likely to take years. Rosekind said the recall was planned through 2019."
"7||County Championship roundup: Marcus Trescothick hits unbeaten centuryMarcus Trescothick\u2019s 60th first-class century adorned the last day of a dull match at Taunton. On a pitch good for batting, though not necessarily good for cricket, Somerset\u2019s opener diligently nullified any threat from earnest Lancashire bowlers. Following on 180 runs behind, Trescothick, accompanied by another veteran, Chris Rogers \u2013 together this pair can boast more than 48,000 first-class runs, although neither is inclined to boastfulness \u2013 sedately batted out the final day. There may be a certain urgency to get down to Taunton to catch a final glimpse of Trescothick this season since he is now into his 41st year. Yet this may be premature. He may be around for a while longer. Trescothick loves playing cricket as much as anyone. And he can still do it. After all, this was his second century of the summer (the first was at The Oval). So he might keep going until the runs dry up and the catches do not land safely in his hands at slip, and that could well include playing next year. To confirm his potential for longevity he even managed to sprint a three to get to his hundred. Having caught his breath he then acknowledged the applause emanating from his own stand. How many players have been able to do that? His innings was dutiful rather than destructive, watchful against seamers and spinners alike, waiting for the chance to unfurl his cut shot, which he did unerringly. There were no frills and few trademark thumping drives through the covers. But there was a job to be done and alongside Rogers, who finished unbeaten on 75, he did it. Lancashire were exasperated by a sluggish pitch that refused to deteriorate significantly. Simon Kerrigan kept bowling on target for much of the day and he dismissed Tom Abell, who presented a simple return catch from his leading edge. The only other wicket to fall was that of Tim Groenewald, a makeshift opener. It was that sort of day and that sort of surface. Not that Lancashire were the only side thwarted by benign batting conditions, which have been partly triggered by the new toss regulations. So far these can only be regarded as a partial success. Spinners are bowling more as Andrew Strauss and co desire. But too often the pitches fail to deteriorate and they are too slow. There have been too many drab run-fests. Just one game in this round of matches produced a win. At Canterbury Kent defeated Glamorgan by 10 wickets with Daniel Bell\u2011Drummond\u2019s alliance with the Kiwi opening bat Tom Latham continuing to prosper. But at Hove Sussex were easily able to bat out the last day against Leicestershire with Chris Nash hitting 144. Elsewhere there were far too many early handshakes \u2013 to the relief of the bowlers. At Worcester Alastair Cook was unbeaten on 48 in a dead game, having hit 142 in his first innings. Likewise at Northampton, Southampton and The Oval there was never any realistic chance of a team notching a win. All of which suggests it is hard to legislate for the ideal surface, which gives batsmen and bowlers an equal chance of success."
"15||The Guardian view on Donald Trump: only one way to stop him nowAfter Mitt Romney lost the 2012 US presidential election to Barack Obama, his Republican party conducted a detailed post-mortem. The review of what had gone wrong was asked to \u201cdig deep\u201d. It proved unsparing in its conclusions. The Republicans had lost the popular vote in five of the previous six presidential elections, the report said. \u201cPublic perception of the party is at record lows,\u201d its authors wrote. \u201cYoung voters are increasingly rolling their eyes at what the party represents, and many minorities wrongly think that Republicans do not like them or want them in the country. When someone rolls their eyes at us, they are not likely to open their ears to us.\u201d And they concluded: \u201cWe sound increasingly out of touch.\u201d Older but clearly not much wiser, this same party is now about to choose as its presidential candidate Donald Trump, a man of whom 67% of Americans in a recent poll said they had an unfavourable opinion, as do 75% of American women and 81% of Hispanic voters. Mr Trump\u2019s victory became all but certain this week after he took the Indiana primary convincingly on Tuesday. Indiana had been cast as the last-ditch stand for Mr Trump\u2019s opponents. But it proved to be merely the latest opportunity for them to display their own serial ineffectiveness against the billionaire populist insurgent. In a manufacturing state that had been hard hit by the recession and in which economic issues are always crucial, the doctrinaire conservative Senator Ted Cruz showed he had little idea of how to appeal to Indiana Republicans and withdrew from the contest after his defeat. John Kasich quickly followed suit. Mr Trump is now the last man standing. It is important to understand how a man with a vast portfolio of private homes, including a three-storey penthouse, decorated in the manner of the palace of Versailles, in New York, a vast Citizen Kane-like estate in Florida and about 40 other apartments and mansions all across America, has successfully forged an apparently rock-solid bond with white Republicans, many of them direct or indirect victims of the housing finance crisis that triggered the 2007-8 crash. At its core is a mix of at least three things. The first is the potency of Trump\u2019s confrontational racial politics, against which the Republican party is peculiarly badly armed because of its own recent history, exemplified among many things by its attitude to Mr Obama. The second is the more than 50-year preoccupation of parts of the party, dating from the Barry Goldwater campaign of 1964 to the present day, with turning it into the vehicle of the conservative religious and cultural movement, a process of which Mr Cruz was merely one of the latest and one of the more inflexible advocates, which has made anger its stock-in-trade. And a third, not fully acknowledged, is the media-driven agenda of the celebrity era. A mesmerised media, as one writer put it this week, has gorged on the Trump story and has failed to subject his candidacy to the critical interrogation that it has spent decades applying, to take a topical example, to Hillary Clinton. Why so? \u201cThe money\u2019s rolling in and this is fun,\u201d is how the head of CBS has put it. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing to say,\u201d he continued, \u201cBut, bring it on, Donald. Keep going.\u201d And Donald keeps going. Can he go all the way? In practice that question now resolves into whether he can beat Mrs Clinton. According to a new poll, Mrs Clinton, who lost again in Indiana, leads Mr Trump by a 13-point margin, 54% to 41%. That lead is consistent with Mr Trump\u2019s well-established high levels of unpopularity among women and minorities, as well as voters more widely. It helps to imply that the Trump candidacy could wreck not just the Republicans\u2019 White House chances but their control of both houses of Congress. Mrs Clinton has weaknesses as well as her many strengths, and this contest has barely even begun. But it is a plain fact that there is only one way to stop Mr Trump now, and that is by electing his opponent."
"15||The movies are a boys\u2019 club, so break it upTen years ago, I was working on feature films as a third assistant director and experienced industry sexism on a daily basis. My very first day on a big budget film set involved male crew members shouting comments about my breasts. It was a lesson as to who had the power on set: not women. So it comes as no surprise to learn a study of the gender of UK film directors over the last decade has found women are under-represented across the board. It truly is an old boys\u2019 club, and while not explicitly barred, women are rarely made to feel welcome. I know my late mentor, the hugely talented director Antonia Bird, suffered both subtle and explicit discrimination in the industry. And despite the support offered by peer support groups like Film Fatales, I don\u2019t believe much has changed for women directors in the last 10 years. With so few women directing films, women\u2019s voices and stories are excluded, and this limits the scope of our culture as a whole. A male-dominated film industry leads to male-focused films \u2013 stories literally being told through a male lens \u2013 leaving women not only under-represented among directors but on screens too. Audiences are therefore restricted in what they get to watch. Film as a commercial art form is unique in that it can shape public opinion as well as respond to it: it should represent our society as a whole. The study by Stephen Follows, commissioned by Directors UK, \u201cfound no evidence of any organised, conscious or deliberate efforts to exclude women from the industry\u201d and concluded that the imbalance is \u201cprimarily due to an unconscious bias\u201d. It is this bias which needs to be challenged. Systemic barriers are preventing women not just from progressing in the industry, but even from getting to the first step on the ladder. I witnessed hugely discriminatory hiring practices in feature films. Jobs were rarely advertised and deals were struck with heads of departments \u2013 almost always male \u2013 who brought with them their own teams of people, frequently consisting of a son, brother, nephew or cousin. It was no surprise, with this nepotism, that most people on set were men. But even if you get your foot in the door, as a female crew member, you still struggle. My polite request for quiet as the cameras were due to roll was met with disparaging responses from the male crew. Often I was ignored, as if I just didn\u2019t exist; frequently I received sexist comments ranging from \u201cDo something useful and make us a cup of tea, love,\u201d through to: \u201cI\u2019ve been in this industry 30 years, darlin\u2019, and I\u2019m not taking orders from a girl.\u201d As a 29-year-old woman, I was shocked to be spoken to like this. Suffice to say that it was a constant battle behind the scenes to prove my worth and be respected. Given all that, it\u2019s no surprise that the sexual harassment I encountered \u2013 having my backside and breasts groped by men on set, and being explicitly propositioned by a Hollywood actor \u2013 was never challenged. I regret never formally complaining about those experiences. When I asked a superior if I could report the sexual harassment, I was told: \u201cYou\u2019d probably win some money in court, but you\u2019ll never work in the industry again.\u201d I was ambitious and wanted to work my way up, and hearing this made me so fearful that I didn\u2019t take it further. If I had challenged it, might that have improved things for the young women below me on the ladder? Or would it have just resulted in one fewer female crew member? Either way, it shouldn\u2019t fall to one person to risk their livelihood in order to challenge the sexism in movies: it needs to be attacked industry-wide. I support Directors UK\u2019s demand that by 2020, 50% of films backed by UK-based public funding bodies should be directed by women, as well as the recommendation that in order for any film to qualify for UK tax relief it should be required to fulfil \u201cdiversity\u201d criteria, including gender. For the latter criteria to be met, I would argue that unions need to be recognised across all film-making departments. Every contract I signed to work on a multimillion-dollar feature film had a clause stating that I had to give up my right to union representation for the duration of the production; if I didn\u2019t agree, I would not be hired. If the gender balance of directors on UK films is to change, then crew members with less status and power need support too. If this study can set in motion an industry-wide campaign to destabilise the old boys\u2019 networks and ensure there is equal representation across departments, this will benefit not just the women currently in the industry, but future generations of women hoping to one day work within it too."
"7||Yorkshire hang on for Nottinghamshire draw after bold chase almost backfiresIn the final 20 overs, a game that had been meandering gently to a draw in the welcome spring warmth burst into a late flourish of hyperactivity. Having eventually bowled Nottinghamshire out for 348 in their second innings, with Chris Read making the 25th hundred of his first\u2011class career and one of the best, Yorkshire were required to make 320 to win in a minimum of 53 overs. They lost Adam Lyth in Jake Ball\u2019s first over just as they had in the first innings, but then a second\u2011wicket stand of 116 between Alex Lees and Gary Ballance used up more than half their overs. In their own minds, though, Yorkshire had made the game safe for themselves whatever the circumstance, and so with Lees on his way to 107 to go with 92 in the first innings and Joe Root at the crease, they started to have a go: 176 from the final 20 overs with eight wickets in hand became 144 from 16. By now Jonny Bairstow was in, Root having been caught on the boundary. Bairstow swept \u2013 yes, swept \u2013 Stuart Broad from outside off-stump and over square leg for six. The bowler responded by delivering the ball into a different postcode outside off stump. Yorkshire persisted. Bairstow made 35 from 20 balls before Broad held a steepler on the boundary while staring into the sun, an important wicket. Then Gurney intervened, first to set Yorkshire back and then to give his side the sniff of a chance themselves. In quick succession, Lees was well taken on the long-leg boundary and Liam Plunkett was caught at mid-off. Time for Yorkshire to shut the shop. In came the field, slips were in place. Then Andrew Gale was lbw to Gurney, and David Willey was dismissed likewise to give the bowler his fourth wicket at a cost of 15 runs in four overs. From Bairstow\u2019s dismissal, Yorkshire had lost five for 24. Now they were clinging on. Gurney had his tail up and Broad came charging in, four slips and two short legs in place, looking for the coup de gr\u00e2ce that had seemed a pipe dream an hour or so earlier. Eight down. Two overs to go. Close fielders encircling completely now. Steve Patterson managed a single to put Adil Rashid on strike and he saw out Gurney\u2019s final salvo, but it left Patterson to face the final over from Broad. The first ball whispered by the edge and the second was stabbed into the deck. Broad was wide with the next and the batsman flagged it through confidently. Not so the next, though. Broad burst through his defence, slammed into the pad and up went Richard Kettleborough\u2019s finger. This left Jack Brooks two balls to survive. He leaned forward to the first and eased a boundary to third man. Last ball, heart pumping. It was short, clipped the thigh pad and bounced to safety. Brooks and Yorkshire survived, hands were shaken and both sides took away 10 points, good enough to lift Nottinghamshire to the top of the table by a single point over Warwickshire. That there was a contest at all was down to Read, with the help of Broad and later Ball and Jackson Bird. Nottinghamshire had a slender lead of 122 overnight and the five wickets in hand immediately became four as Samit Patel was dismissed to a fine catch by Root without the score moving. But Read, who only had 13 at the start of play, batted with commendable defiance and skill while Broad played with abandon against some indifferent bowling, making 55 from 57 balls before edging a screamer to slip. Their stand of 104 had already got them back in the game. Eventually, with the last man Gurney for company, Read reached his century, from 178 balls, by hitting Adil Rashid over mid-on for his 14th boundary to go with three sixes. He was last out, caught on the fence straight afterwards. By then Nottinghamshire looked safe and the game, on a good pitch, seemed all but dead."
"1||Cameron to propose global anti-corruption agency at summitAn international anti-corruption body to help law enforcement agencies and investigators track down money laundering and tax evasion is to be one of the central proposals of next week\u2019s anti-corruption summit hosted by David Cameron. The new international agency is likely to involve broadening the remit of the the Paris-based OECD, which is already undertaking work on bribery and international tax rules, Sir Eric Pickles, Cameron\u2019s anti-corruption adviser, said. Pickles added that the body would not have law enforcement powers of its own, but would act as an information exchange for governments committed to fighting corruption. Cameron, facing claims that Britain has not done enough to clear up corruption in UK-administered tax havens, hopes the body will be a permanent institutional legacy of the summit, alongside a series of other commitments that countries attending the summit can adopt. Pickles disclosed that sports bodies including Fifa and Uefa would also sign a joint statement pledging to fighting corruption in sport. He said the statement would commit them to fighting bribery, gambling and drugs in an acknowledgement that the global integrity of sport was under question as never before. It will be the first time international sports bodies have come together to make such a statement. It is also likely that the summit will endorse greater transparency in public procurement, citing initiatives in eastern Europe, Colombia and Mexico. Cameron has invited all 20 member states within the G20, including Russia, Brazil and South Africa \u2013 three countries mired in corruption allegations. Russia will be represented by its deputy foreign minister, Oleg Syromolotov, while the US will be represented by its secretary of state, John Kerry. Kerry will probably come under pressure to do more to reform the tax secrecy surrounding states such as Delaware. As many as 40 countries are due to attend. The summit is regarded as Cameron\u2019s major diplomatic initiative of the year, and will be followed by further summits in Paris and Japan later in the year, Pickles said. He said: \u201cThe Panama Papers has changed the climate. Those who come up with technical arguments about why change cannot be made, or say they need more time, are getting a lot less of a hearing. The public are impatient to see progress. The Panama Papers showed a lot of sons of presidents and relatives of presidents thought they could hide their people\u2019s money abroad. Transparency is going to make that a lot more difficult.\u201d He also gave his support to the proposal that all foreign companies purchasing properties in the UK be required to reveal the full beneficial ownership of the company purchasing the property. He said: \u201cThere is no reason why it should be possible to know the name of a UK property owner in the Land Registry, but not the name of a foreign owner. It will make it a lot easier to detect money laundering and will raise questions how a particular person managed to acquire the money to buy a property at No 3 Mayfair Towers.\u201d The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has already issued a consultation on the proposed measure. Conservative MPs have also started to put pressure on the prime minister to set a deadline at the summit by which UK overseas territories must publish public beneficial ownership registers or face direct intervention by the UK government. The UK is publishing a public register of beneficial ownership in three weeks\u2019 time, but overseas territories have insisted registers should only be open to law enforcement bodies and not the general public. Pickles defended the compromise: \u201cI think there is a misunderstanding on this. It is a great leap forward that the overseas territories are going to make their registers open to law enforcement agencies such as the Serious Fraud Office on demand and the company involved will not know it is being investigated, and it will not be tipped off. \u201cIt has taken a long time to get the overseas territories this far, and there was no point in David Cameron waiting for perfection. The deal is not a roadblock. It is a huge leap forward.\u201d Nigel Mills, the Conservative MP for Amber Valley and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on corruption, said on Tuesday he wanted the summit to back public registers. He said: \u201cThe important thing will be to get real commitments on beneficial ownership and a timeframe for the register to be transparent and public, so everyone can see who owns every company established in a jurisdiction\u201d. Charities are calling for a deadline of 2017 to be set for the overseas territories. Mills was backed by the former chair of the public accounts committee Margaret Hodge, who said the summit needed to take action on the overseas territories or else it would be seen as a PR stunt. Robert Barrington from Transparency International said: \u201cAn innovative aspect of this summit is that it does not rely on consensus \u2013 government can sign up to the parts they are willing to deliver. \u201cThat means it should move beyond the usual platitudes, but it also means some of the more stretching deliverables might get very few signatures on the page. To be a success, each of the deliverables needs to have sufficient countries that there will be a critical mass.\u201d"
"15||The Guardian view on Cameron\u2019s offer to refugee children: it\u2019s the least he could doDavid Cameron has bowed to backbench pressure as well as something like national moral anguish, and announced that Britain will take in some unaccompanied child refugees. It is a welcome and long-overdue concession. But the policy shift is hedged about with restrictions that may mean it turns out to be worth less than meets the eye. And in an equal and opposite move, moments after the prime minister\u2019s announcement, the home office minister James Brokenshire came to the House of Commons to tell MPs that Britain would play no part in any new EU proposal to penalise countries that did not take a proportion of the refugees arriving on the continent. Regrettably, Mr Cameron\u2019s concession on child refugees does not signal anything like a rethink of refugee policy. The new approach to children is a minimalist, pragmatic response to overwhelming pressure. That is typical of most of the government\u2019s attitude to the refugee crisis. Every concession, even when protecting vulnerable children has been the aim, has been wrung from it. The emphasis has been on the obstacles in the path of success. This instinct might usefully be applied to other government projects. But it is stony-hearted when applied to desperate and traumatised people fleeing a war zone. That is not to deny that the government has been a generous donor to refugee camps in the Middle East. It would also be fatuous to pretend that there are no difficulties to be tackled before what to many Britons is a clear moral obligation can be fulfilled. The most urgent is that the councils that will be responsible for caring for refugee children are properly resourced. Some children will be very traumatised and vulnerable. They may need skilled professional support. In the wake of the new commitment, the Local Government Association, representing all English councils, already looking after 4,000 refugee children, pointed out that there is still neither a functioning dispersal scheme nor adequate cash to support more, although that has not stopped many councils from offering. The government is possibly wise to be so cautious about creating perverse incentives that may encourage traffickers, which is the reason it gives for only taking in lone children who reached Europe before the EU-Turkey deal on refugees was struck in March. Yet it can still be possible to respond more urgently and in a less mean-spirited way to such need. The prime minister has been strongly criticised, even in the normally friendly press, and by survivors of the Kindertransport that rescued 10,000 Jewish children from Europe before the outbreak of the second world war. One of those children was Lord Dubs, whose amendment to the immigration bill was set to be carried in the Commons next Monday after 30 Tories made clear they would support it. MPs, and charities like Save the Children that have been lobbying, have backed the settlement. They welcome the belated recognition of the principle of taking in children who have reached Europe, even where they do not have family in the UK. Wednesday\u2019s decision may yet mean many more than the 3,000 children that campaigners wanted will be able to come to the UK to find security and loving families. But if there is no extra money, the number allowed in may be restricted to hundreds rather than thousands. There has also been a renewed promise to speed up the process of assessing the children stranded in wretched camps in Calais and Dunkirk who have family in Britain, but it is a promise that has been heard before. Nor is there any movement yet on finding ways to harness the thousands of families who have offered to help. There is much uncertainty around these new policy shifts. When the call from Brussels for a shared EU-wide response to the greatest refugee crisis since the end of the second world war has been rejected, it seems the government has made the smallest shift it thought was necessary to avoid defeat. Every move is welcome; but would that it had been a bigger one, and more generous."
"15||Donald Trump\u2019s triumph is a lesson for Europe\u2019s politiciansDonald Trump\u2019s emergence as Republican candidate for the American presidency may yet be a blessing in disguise \u2013 albeit a heavy disguise. The reckless, belligerent, mendacious inexperience of the man is awesome. It is never good to see virtue in a bully or a thug. With no record of public service, Trump can be judged only on his private behaviour, and that is by all accounts deplorable. Even as Trump moved into an unassailable lead over his rival, Ted Cruz, he could not resist a torrent of abuse. Cruz, he said, was a serial liar and had five extramarital affairs. His father was associated with Lee Harvey Oswald, John F Kennedy\u2019s assassin. For good measure, Cruz retorted that Trump was \u201camoral, a pathological liar, narcissist and buffoon\u201d. His father pleaded to \u201cevery member of the body of Christ to vote according to the word of God\u201d and avoid America\u2019s destruction at the hands of Trump. Outsiders at such moments wonder what the hell is happening to America. But the answer is simple and salutary. When democracy slithers towards oligarchy, as has federal America, the mob retaliates. Congress has become an aloof, gerrymandered, constitutional dinosaur. It renders the most powerful nation on Earth ungovernable, even by so palpably sincere and competent a leader as Barack Obama. No problem, says democracy, and turns to the nearest available antidote. It votes for the outsider, the anti-Washingtonian, the shaker-up of things. If the establishment gangs up to stop him, democracy backs him all the more. It backs him even if he is Trump. Let that be a lesson, says democracy, to all oligarchs and stuffed shirts and nice talkers. Step out of line and we will give you someone so awful, so disruptive, he will be a nightmare. Trump\u2019s candidacy now enters new territory. While his appeal so far has been to the back woods, he is no real backwoodsman. Indeed the Republican establishment was more appalled by the ultra-rightwing Cruz, a candidate they knew and loathed. As Michael Tomasky points out in the current New York Review of Books, they would \u201crather spend four years calling Trump \u2018Mr President\u2019 than have to genuflect to Cruz\u201d. Better the devil they didn\u2019t know. In contrast January\u2019s issue of the conservative National Review was directed \u201cAgainst Trump\u201d. Rightwing commentators lined up to abuse him for being a big-government lefty. They cited his support for a fiscal stimulus during the credit crunch, for backing the bailouts of the banks and carmakers. He demanded \u201cthe government take over companies\u201d to save them and their employees from recession. The National Review did not like that. Indeed Trump, at least in the past, was a relatively progressive New Yorker. He was pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-healthcare and deeply critical of George Bush\u2019s Iraq war. On most of these he has since flipped and flopped outrageously \u2013 in the case of abortion, ludicrously so. His opportunism has been total. But if Trump can flip one way, he can assuredly flop back. He seems at times almost to be enacting a parody of a modern politician. Trump\u2019s one killer issue has been immigration, on which he has gone straight for the conservative soul. In common with half Europe\u2019s current politicians, he plays on the insecurity that settled communities feel towards newcomers. Republicans seem ready to take Trump\u2019s vacillation on social issues as a price to pay for his elephantine antagonism towards migrants. Others may mouth bromides about immigration control. Trump espouses brutally specific remedies. Get them out, he says, and keep them out. Hanging, drawing and quartering seems too good for them. He presumably relies on few immigrants bothering to vote. It is working. After long trailing behind Hillary Clinton in the opinion polls, Trump finally edged ahead of her in a Rasmussen Reports survey on Monday. Support had shifted from 41-36 in Clinton\u2019s favour in March to 41-39 in Trump\u2019s favour now. The much-trumpeted assumption that the Trump brand has too many \u201cnegatives\u201d to be electable, especially among women, no long looks the case. With the nomination under his belt, Trump\u2019s defeat by Clinton is no foregone conclusion. He could yet be the Leicester City of American politics. Trump must now make peace with his own party and its donors if he is to recruit the vote-getters on which victory in swing states depends. He is rich, but he is not rich enough to do without them. He must also make peace with an electorate that he has so far disregarded \u2013 the tasteful, dignified, risk-averse Republican America, an America that so far sees him as truly awful. The game is on to detoxify Trump. If it works, who knows what may happen? If it does not work, Trump need concern the world no more. Europeans may watch these events with dismay. America\u2019s capacity to scare the wits out of the rest of the world is undimmed. But as the historian Arthur Schlesinger remarked of the McCarthy era, America regularly takes democracy to the edge of the cliff, wobbles there awhile and then draws back. How America votes is America\u2019s business. David Cameron was silly last December to dismiss Trump as \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong\u201d \u2013 not because it was inaccurate but because foreign leaders should keep their noses out of each other\u2019s domestic politics. Trump\u2019s aides are demanding \u201can apology or some sort of retraction\u201d, which is the more humiliating for Cameron. The prime minister seems devoid of sound advice these days. The best response to Trump is to look into our own backyards. Europe displays the same detachment of political elites from public opinion, the same deaf ears and clogged arteries. In Britain, the so-called \u201cnew politics\u201d of Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Alex Salmond has proved as effective as Trump\u2019s, and for the same reason. With politics less a matter of personal interest than of psychology and tribal attitude, the slick hypocrisy of the Blair-Cameron years is vulnerable to the new, media-friendly authenticity. Across Europe, Trump-like characters are emerging from the ooze of a decaying political union. Some are deeply unattractive. Some are dangerous. But it is no good just deploring them. If Trump proves anything, it is that you can\u2019t deplore all the people all the time. There is no substitute for listening, arguing, persuading \u2013 because sooner or later they get round to voting."
"21||Large human brain evolved thanks to increased metabolic rateThe hefty brains that set humans apart from other apes came into being when our ancient ancestors massively ramped up their metabolism, scientists say. The shift in metabolic gear, after the human lineage split from other primates, gave humans enough energy to run larger brains, have children in rapid succession, and live longer lives, the researchers found. The US team measured the metabolic rates of more than 100 people and compared them to similar measurements of chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans. They found that weight-for-weight, humans burned calories much faster than any other primate, and that the energy was likely spent on fuelling our brains, longer lives and childbearing habits. While adult humans can have children every two years or so, apes space out their childbearing, and while humans typically live into their 70s and 80s, chimps often die in their 50s. On a daily basis humans burned 400 more calories than chimpanzees and bonobos, the close relatives of chimps, 635 more calories than gorillas, and 820 more calories than orangutans, the scientists report in the journal Nature. At 1200ml, the human brain is more than twice the size of an ape brain. And while increasing metabolic rate is a risky evolutionary strategy - if food becomes scarce, you die fast - the benefits of a larger brain may have outweighed the downsides. \u201cEvery gram of brain uses an enormous amount of calories,\u201d said Herman Pontzer, the first author on the study at Hunter College in New York. Writing in the journal, Pontzer and his colleagues at Loyola University in Chicago describe the advances that humans made that allowed them to ramp up their metabolism. First, they learned to share food, making groups of early humans more resilient. Next, they diversified their diets, and took to eating more energy rich foods such as meat. Thirdly, humans developed much larger deposits of body fat, which we can draw on when food is scarce. \u201cThe fat is your reserve tank to help fuel this metabolic engine that we have revved up compared to the other apes,\u201d said Pontzer. For the study, the scientists measured total energy expenditure over seven to 10 days as the apes and humans followed their usual routines. The metabolic rates of 141 adult humans were compared with those of 27 chimps, 11 orangutans, 10 gorillas and eight bonobos Humans had a greater percentage of body fat than apes and showed marked gender differences, with men having 22.9% body fat, compared with 15.2% for male gorillas, and women 41.7%, compared with 13.9% for female gorillas. Christopher Kuzawa at Northwestern University said the study provided \u201cconvincing evidence that humans expend more energy than other great apes, which could help explain how we manage to \u2018have our cake and eat it too\u2019 as a species \u2013 giving birth to many, high-investment offspring, while also helping offset the costs of our unusually expensive brains.\u201d But he added that the findings were not the last word on the role of energy in the human story, and how we managed to evolve such energetically costly brains. The study focuses on adults, he said, and so misses important differences in childhood, when the costs of wiring the brain and learning make it even more demanding. In childhood, the human brain accounts for 66% of the human base rate metabolism, which is three times more than that in the adult. \u201cThe exceptionally high costs of childhood brain development were subsidized by slowing body growth rate,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the costs of the child\u2019s brain increases, growth rate slows, and the age of slowest body growth is also the age of maximal brain energy costs.\u201d"
"2||BHP Billiton faces legal spat in which all tactics are deemed fairIt is ridiculous for the Brazilian independent prosecution service to argue that the damages for the disaster at Samarco, an iron ore operation owned by Vale and BHP Billiton, should be the same as those paid by BP after its Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. There is no link between the two incidents. But the pointed reference to Deepwater Horizon in the 155bn real (\u00a330bn) claim tells BHP and its local partner they now face a proper legal fight in which all tactics are deemed fair. The prosecutors\u2019 aim is clearly to extract the maximum sum by whatever means. Indeed, there seems to be a secondary ambition of heaping embarrassment on the Brazilian government, which the independent prosecutors accuse of selling out in striking a settlement in March that observers estimated to be worth between 12bn and 20bn real. BHP\u2019s shareholders seemed surprised by this turn of legal events \u2013 the share price fell 6% \u2013 but they should not have been. Brazilian politics is in crisis and the country\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, is fighting for her survival. A dam disaster in which 19 people died, 700 people lost their homes and a tide of mud and residue ran 300 miles downstream to the mouth of the river Doce was always likely to acquire a deep political dimension. In that regard, a comparison can be made with Deepwater Horizon, where BP\u2019s Britishness was hauled centre stage. The other similarity is that the case is bound to drag on for years, introducing fresh political risk for BHP and Vale if Rousseff falls. The eventual outcome probably won\u2019t be the eye-catching \u00a330bn demanded in the latest lawsuit. Equally, though, the $5bn (\u00a33.4bn) or so in the government-sponsored settlement should now be seen as wishful thinking. Next\u2019s finger-in-the-air exercise proves mildly reassuring Here is Next\u2019s considered opinion on the current state of consumer demand, derived from an analysis of its own trading in the past six weeks: \u201cDunno, guv, we only sell clothes and stuff.\u201d The firm\u2019s chief executive, Lord Wolfson, didn\u2019t put it like that, of course. Instead there was a worthy discourse on the effect of weather on recent weak sales - cold in March and April versus last year\u2019s hot Easter - followed by a confession that the real problem may just be that consumers are spending less. Amid the uncertainty, Next reckons its sales this year could fall by 3.5%, but might rise by the same percentage. Put another way, pre-tax profits could decrease 8.9% to \u00a3748m or could improve 3.7% to \u00a3852m. It might seem odd that the market regarded this finger-in-the-air exercise as mildly reassuring - Next\u2019s shares rose 3.5% - Ibut in a sense it is. Widening the range of possible profit outcomes to \u00a3104m - from \u00a374m only two months ago - is unusual, but the key conclusion is surely that Next doesn\u2019t expect to come apart at the seams, whatever happens. The low-end profit figure of \u00a3748m is hardly a disaster, even if it is correct that consumer confidence has turned down. In the long term, Next faces the problem of combating competitors who seem to have learned and copied its best distribution and logistics tricks. An upgrade is required for the online and catalogue Directory business, as Next admits. The short-term headaches, though, seem more irritating than painful. More reasons to be cheerful at Sainsbury\u2019s Sainsbury\u2019s relentless cheerfulness stands in contrast to Next\u2019s default caution. The trouble is, the terrain looks fundamentally trickier for the supermarket chain. Yes, Sainsbury\u2019s deserves plaudits for hanging onto its 16.5% share of the grocery market as its main rivals have stumbled. Yes, its chief executive, Mike Coupe, is on track to deliver every last penny of his three-year \u00a3500m cost-saving programme. And, if we\u2019re being scrupulously fair, he may also be correct that the punters are crying to taste the \u201cmulti-product, multichannel shopping experience\u201d that the purchase of Argos is intended to conjure. In the end, two financial statistics stand out from the full-year figures. First, underlying profits of \u00a3587m, down 14% on the year, were the lowest since 2009. Second, operating profit margins fell from 3% to 2.7%, meaning Sainsbury\u2019s travelled away from its medium-term ambition of 3% to 3.5%. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Coupe and co\u2019s strategy \u2013 keep plugging away in food and experiment elsewhere \u2013 but the warning that \u201cthe market is competitive, and it will remain so for the foreseeable future\u201d should be taken literally. Amazon is poised to try its luck in fresh food, which may be the trigger for Walmart to order its underlings at Asda to wake up. LSE and Deutsche love-in holds firm It\u2019s the perennial bleat of the disappointed would-be bidder \u2013 we didn\u2019t get enough \u201cengagement\u201d from the other side. The latest disaffected party is Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, which had dreamed of pouncing on the London Stock Exchange and thus busting the European love-in with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Let\u2019s not waste time on overtures supposedly rebuffed. The rules of the takeover game are straightforward. If you wave a decent offer, your target is usually obliged to give you a hearing. Just don\u2019t expect a red carpet. In the case of LSE/Deutsche, it was obvious from day one that the partners would be separated only by force."
"0||Lawsuit aims to stop licensing of Texas immigration detention facilitiesImmigration activists are fighting back against a Texas decision to license immigration detention centres that critics call \u201cbaby jails\u201d. A judge in Austin granted a temporary restraining order on Wednesday evening to stop the licensing, five days after the Texas department of family and protective services (DFPS) awarded a childcare licence to one of two federal family holding facilities near San Antonio. The second was set to receive its permit imminently. Judge Karin Crump will hear the case - brought by two detained mothers and Grassroots Leadership, an Austin-based group opposed to private prisons - on 13 May. The plaintiffs are seeking a temporary injunction to prevent Texas from implementing a new rule that enables the state agency to license the centres. Luis Zayas, a psychologist and social worker at the University of Texas who interviewed migrants in Karnes in 2014 called the new licences \u201can extraordinary manipulation of the rules of child welfare\u201d. \u201cSure, they put up nice children\u2019s playgrounds and things; it\u2019s still a prison,\u201d he said. There are classrooms, playgrounds and soccer fields, but the complexes in Dilley and Karnes are far from what most people would consider a child-friendly environment. In one public meeting held by the agency last December, a Japanese-American woman said that when she visited Dilley it reminded her of the time she spent in a second world war internment camp. \u201cStern, unfriendly guards led me and my fellow visitors through locked doors to the visitation room after requiring us to leave all our belongings, including art supplies and writing materials, in lockers outside,\u201d said Satsuki Ina, a psychotherapist. \u201cDuring my visit, I met with six families who had been held for varying lengths of time. Aside from the intense anxiety, depressed mood, and grief expressed by the mothers, I noticed significant signs of what I would consider captivity trauma of the children.\u201d Dozens more lined up to argue that treating detention centres run by for-profit prison companies as childcare facilities would be a perversion of the state agency\u2019s mission because it would help prop up an incarceration system that damages the physical and mental health of vulnerable women and children. Zayas, who found in 2014 that detention caused serious psychiatric disorders and development regression including reversion to breastfeeding, believes that as little as a couple of weeks in the facilities could have profound long-lasting effects on the mental health of both young and older children. These children may well have already experienced traumatic conditions in their home countries and on the way to the US, are anxious about whether they will be deported and \u201care witnessing their mothers be disempowered by the way they are treated\u201d, he said. Yet the DFPS pressed on. The lawsuit argues that the DFPS is overstepping its authority by regulating places that are not, in reality, childcare establishments. Patrick Crimmins, a DFPS spokesman, said the agency is reviewing the suit and consulting with the state\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office. \u201cBy all reasonable measures, family detention camps are prisons. They are not childcare facilities,\u201d Bob Libal, executive director of Grassroots Leadership, said in a statement. It is not the first time the group has taken legal action on the issue: It won a temporary injunction last November to stop the state from using an emergency rule to fast-track the licensing process without public comment. The DFPS had previously taken the position that regulating the centres was not within its purview. But last summer a judge in California, Dolly Gee, issued a stinging decision that lambasted the conditions inside the facilities. Gee ruled that detaining minors in unlicensed facilities for more than a couple of days violated a previous court settlement. The judgment appeared to threaten the future of the Obama administration\u2019s controversial use of family detention, which it expanded amid the dramatic influx of unaccompanied minors in the summer of 2014. The expansion was hoped to act as a deterrent to thousands of Central Americans travelling north to seek asylum in the US and escape increased violence in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. While appealing Gee\u2019s ruling, in an effort to show compliance and keep the centres open, the federal government began releasing families with pending asylum cases more quickly, allowing them to join up with relatives in the US. However, the problem of Dilley and Karnes lacking licences remained. Until, shortly before Gee\u2019s deadline last October, the Texas agency suddenly developed an urge to regulate them \u2013 despite its already immensely stretched resources. The agency said that the case \u201chighlighted a gap in the oversight of the children\u201d. It argues that making Dilley and Karnes subject to its scrutiny will improve safety and quality of care and that taking a stance in the broader debate about whether to lock up migrants is not within its remit. A DFPS inspection of Karnes on 29 March found six deficiencies: cleaning carts left unattended; too little mulch in the playground; failure to clearly list a child\u2019s allergies and chronic health conditions in a health file; failure to clearly state the right for a child not to be threatened with the loss of shelter as punishment; an employee not qualified for his or her position; a child found in a bedroom without his or her mother or a staff member present. Five of these issues had been verified as corrected on 22 April. The initial six-month licence was issued a week later and will be renewed if the facilities comply with minimum standards and deficiencies are corrected, Crimmins said. Karnes has a capacity of 580 people; Dilley, about 2,400. An inspection of Dilley on 6 April, when 459 children were in the facility, found 12 problems \u2013 from worn surfaces in the playgrounds and badly anchored soccer goals in the sports fields to medical supplies not being locked away, a child being made ill because his gluten allergy was ignored, expired fruit juice and inadequate staff training. The DFPS created a special rule for the centres which lowers its usual minimum standards for criteria such as room occupancy and sharing bedrooms with adults and children of the opposite gender. Critics say this underlines that the facilities are intrinsically unsuitable to be regulated as childcare buildings; the agency argues the changes help keep families together. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to accept this as a final defeat in our attempt to end family detention,\u201d said Jonathan Ryan, executive director of the legal aid organisation Raices. He said that in addition to seeking to hold the federal government accountable for conditions inside the centres, advocates would now also put pressure on Texas. \u201cWe call on the state of Texas to live up to this responsibility and properly enforce its jurisdiction over the care and custody of these children,\u201d he said. Pablo Paez, corporate vice-president of the GEO Group, which runs Karnes, said in a statement: \u201cThe Karnes County Residential Center provides high quality care in a safe, clean, and family friendly environment, and onsite US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel provide direct oversight to ensure compliance with ICE\u2019s Family Residential Standards. Our company has consistently, strongly denied allegations to the contrary.\u201d He cited regular inspections and audits that have ensured compliance. Activists and attorneys have made complaints to the Department of Homeland Security which allege substandard mental and physical healthcare, including one case where a mother sought medical help for her two-year-old daughter on seven occasions before she was finally diagnosed with asthma. One woman from El Salvador who has been detained in Karnes for more than a month with her 12-year-old daughter described her experience in a complaint seen by the Guardian: \u201cMy daughter and I are not doing well in detention. We are both sad and we both cry. We feel like criminals. We cannot go anywhere without permission. \u201cGuards walk through our bedroom at night every 15 to 30 minutes. This wakes us up and makes us feel afraid. We are rounded up and counted three times a day. We feel like prisoners,\u201d she says. Last month a guard at the sole family immigration detention centre outside Texas, Berks County in Pennsylvania, admitted unlawful sexual relations with a detainee. Berks County remains open even though state officials said earlier this year they were revoking its licence to operate as a child residential facility."
"22||Mental health champion for UK schools axed after criticising governmentThe government has dropped its mental health champion for schools after she publicly criticised current education policies, in particular the testing regime, which she claims is detrimental to children\u2019s mental health. Natasha Devon was appointed by the government last August to raise awareness of and reduce the stigma surrounding young people\u2019s mental health, as part of a wider \u00a31.25bn drive to improve care. On Wednesday, however, it emerged that the high-profile role had been axed, raising concerns that the government was attempting to silence her. The Department for Education denied this, saying Devon would remain on their mental health steering group, which would be making recommendations in the summer. Supporters said they were not surprised she had been let go as she had become \u201ca thorn in the flesh\u201d of the DfE after speaking out against government policies. Last week, at a conference of headteachers in London, she highlighted the academic pressures facing young people, saying she knew her opinions would not be popular in some circles, but felt she had to be brave and speak out. \u201cTime and time again over recent years young people \u2013 and the people who teach them \u2013 have spoken out about how a rigorous culture of testing and academic pressure is detrimental to their mental health,\u201d she said. \u201cAt one end of the scale we\u2019ve got four-year-olds being tested, at the other end of the scale we\u2019ve got teenagers leaving school and facing the prospect of leaving university with record amounts of debt. Anxiety is the fastest growing illness in under 21s. These things are not a coincidence.\u201d The DfE denied that the axing of the role was connected to Devon\u2019s criticism of government policy, or that she was being silenced, but said it was because a new cross-government mental health champion was being appointed, which made Devon\u2019s role obsolete. Luciana Berger, mental health shadow minister, said Devon had spoken out \u201copenly and honestly about the challenges facing children\u2019s mental health under this Tory government. \u201cIf she has been silenced then this raises serious questions over the government\u2019s commitment to listening to the evidence and acting in the best interests of young people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing. \u201cMinisters must explain themselves as a matter of urgency. Nicky Morgan [the education secretary] claims to be in \u2018listening mode\u2019 but it would appear that this does not extend to those that do not agree with her.\u201d A DfE spokesperson said Devon had done \u201ca great job of helping us to raise the profile of young people\u2019s mental health since her appointment last year. \u201cSince that time, the independent NHS taskforce report has been published, which recommended that a cross-government mental health champion be created \u2013 for this reason we have had to reconsider the department\u2019s own role. \u201cWe have asked Natasha and others who have been involved in our work to empower schools and young people to promote good mental health to continue to work with us as we prepare to launch our activity later this year.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cNatasha will remain a full member of the DfE\u2019s mental health steering group, which will be making recommendations this summer. Natasha will stay closely involved with all our work.\u201d Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity YoungMinds, said: \u201cWe are very surprised and sad that Natasha\u2019s role as mental health champion has ended. She\u2019s done a superb job of drawing attention to the crucial importance of mental health and wellbeing in schools.\u201d News of Devon\u2019s departure came the day after hundreds of parents chose to keep their children at home on Tuesday in a day of protest against tougher primary school tests, which they claim are causing stress anxiety in schools. But Devon\u2019s criticism went beyond mental health in the classroom. In a column for the Times Educational Supplement she accused the government of engineering \u201ca social climate where it\u2019s really difficult for any young person to enjoy optimal mental health\u201d. She said parents \u201cwork every hour God sends\u201d, which reduces quality family time, while spiralling poverty had pushed a million young people into dependence on food banks. On Wednesday Devon told the Guardian she was assessing her options. \u201cI can confirm that I am no longer authorised to comment as the government\u2019s mental health champion for schools. \u201cThe DfE have extended an opportunity for me to continue working on the peer-to-peer project they were seeking my advice on.\u201d She was also in talks regarding another offer, adding: \u201cEither way I\u2019m not going anywhere and will continue to campaign for the rights of young people and those who teach them.\u201d While Devon\u2019s role with the government was unpaid to enable her to be completely independent and objective, the new cross-government mental health champion \u2013 which will be advertised shortly \u2013 is expected to be salaried. Appointing her as the first ever mental health champion for schools, education and childcare, minister Sam Gyimah said: \u201cNatasha is an inspiration to many young people and I\u2019m delighted to have her on board as our first mental health champion.\u201d She is the founder the Self-Esteem Team and Body Gossip, organisations that deliver mental health education to young people and visit three schools a week, delivering classes to more than 50,000 teenagers, as well as parents and teachers. Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \u201cThe department has got rid of a thorn in its flesh. Natasha has been a completely trenchant and very brave campaigner and advocate for children\u2019s and young people\u2019s mental health. \u201cShe has spoken forcefully about teenage and children\u2019s mental health and she has said really important things. Firstly that resources available for dealing with young people\u2019s mental ill-health are inadequate. \u201cShe has also said that the current government\u2019s \u2013 and previous administration\u2019s \u2013 education policies and the increase in testing have led to an increase in stress and pressure in schools. \u201cThat will have really annoyed the department. I\u2019m not surprised they\u2019ve let her go.\u201d"
"9||What will Hollywood make of Leicester\u2019s spellbinding season?In days of yore (yes, yes \u2013 some time in the mid-cretaceous era) I used to be the secretary on the Sun showbiz desk. Shortly after I started, it was explained to me that there were really only 10 tabloid showbiz stories. These include \u201cis set to wed\u201d, \u201cis set to split from\u201d, and \u201chas splashed out on a new\u201d. The best that can be said about one type of tale on the list \u2013 \u201cis set to become a Hollywood movie\u201d \u2013 is that it is probably the one least likely to come true. There are various reasons for this. They range from the fact that a tiny percentage of movies \u201cin development\u201d ever make it to the screen, to the far greater probability that the tale was only filed because the hack had nothing in the cupboard as a Sunday-for-Monday story. And, despite being a blatant invention, it is not the sort of one likely to elicit a legal complaint. Nobody minds being linked with a Hollywood movie, do they? Some, it must be said, can take it or leave it. \u201cIf that\u2019s what they want to do, then so be it,\u201d the Leicester striker Jamie Vardy laughed back in November about reported plans to turn his story into the proverbial Hollywood movie. By February, Adrian Butchart \u2013 the screenwriter in question \u2013 had watched Leicester\u2019s 2-0 win over Liverpool in Vardy\u2019s private box, and posed for a group photo with his girlfriend and agent. Now that the Foxes have only gone and done it, Adrian\u2019s project is reported to be gathering pace. \u201cWhile the central character in the film is Jamie Vardy,\u201d he tells the Daily Mirror, \u201cwhat has happened over the past couple of weeks, when we saw the other Leicester players come together as a team in his absence and prove that they have what it takes to win, has really brought them to the forefront.\u201d Butchart is sweetly described as a \u201cmovie guru\u201d by the Daily Mirror, and crucial to this gurudom appears to be a particularly ruthless form of asceticism. His IMDb entry suggests he has not written a movie for nearly 10 years, when he gave us Goal II: Living the Dream. Two years prior to that was Goal! \u2013 and that is almost it. A rifle through my esteemed colleague Peter Bradshaw\u2019s archives finds he opened his review of Goal! with the stark observation: \u201cThe word \u2018own\u2019 is missing from the title of this cameo-packed football film.\u201d An intro which somehow recalls the two-word review of Spinal Tap\u2019s comeback album Shark Sandwich (which, you will recall, read merely: \u201cShit sandwich.\u201d) So, Leicester may well be hoping for the phenomenon of \u201crival productions\u201d, recently explored by Mark Kermode. As for what will happen to the spellbinding Leicester story once it has been through the wringer of the Hollywood system, I can hardly bear to think. My personal favourite rendering of the movie process is in Robert Altman\u2019s The Player, where our first sight of Richard E Grant is as a profoundly earnest movie director pitching his integrity-heavy death row picture. \u201cNo stars, no pat happy endings,\u201d he insists. There will be no eleventh-hour reprieve of the wrongly convicted murderess: \u201cBecause \u2026 That\u2019s. The reality. The innocent die.\u201d By the time we get to the first screening of the final cut, we see a last-second pardon being phoned through, before the window of the prison gas chamber is shot out by Bruce Willis, who leaps in to free the condemned woman. As he carries her out in his arms, Julia Roberts asks: \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Bruce smiles. \u201cThe traffic was a bitch.\u201d Long before we arrive at this kind of creative compromise with the Leicester project, of course, we can rely on passing certain milestones. First one? Vinnie Jones will be linked with it. Sources close to Vinnie Jones \u2013 player-manager of Brits In LA For No Good Reason \u2013 will tell a journalist that the footballer turned straight-to-GIF star is in talks to star in the Leicester movie. And yet, even as I typed those words, I thought it wise to Google \u2026 and there it was. \u201cFormer football hardman Vinnie Jones is set to be approached to play the part of former Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson in the upcoming Jamie Vardy biopic.\u201d Well, he\u2019s not the only one. One Direction\u2019s Louis Tomlinson is \u201crumoured\u201d to be in line to play Vardy, which has already produced some artistic niggle. Kasabian, whose guitarist Serge Pizzorno supports Leicester, are interested in doing the movie soundtrack, though not entranced by the possibility of Tomlinson\u2019s casting. Others to be linked with the movie include Emilia Clarke, whose line-mangling in Game of Thrones is \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 irrelevant considering the rest of her performance, but may be more painfully foregrounded in the role of Khal Vardy\u2019s girlfriend. As for what will be left on the cutting room floor, aside from a casino scene, I can only picture an American studio executive screaming: \u201cThe hell is this Stamford Bridge bullshit? I am not paying tens of millions of dollars for my money shot to happen a hundred miles away in London! Do you think Casablanca would have been better if Rick hadn\u2019t said goodbye to Ilsa so we could all watch some scene nobody cares about in Czechoslovakia? Read my lips: the grand final in the Premier League series is held at King Power and that\u2019s non-negotiable. If you don\u2019t like it, get back to Britain and get on your knees for the Lottery.\u201d And so on. I realise that \u201ca Hollywood movie\u201d is still regarded by many as the highest honour contemporary culture can bestow. But I can\u2019t help hoping that the Leicester movie remains safely locked in development hell in perpetuity. The real life story is electrifying \u2013 a fictional version would have \u201cGary Barlow investment vehicle\u201d written all over it."
"1||Biologist tries to stop US from sending chimpanzees to private facilities abroadWhen Jen Feuerstein last saw Tara, she was only three. Feuerstein, a biologist, remembers the chimpanzee as \u201cvery playful and active\u201d. Her aunt, Georgia, was \u201ca beautiful, slender, dark female \u2026 who radiated intelligence and was very close to her family\u201d. Thirteen years later, Feuerstein and a global group of plaintiffs are suing the US government to stop the transfer of Tara, Georgia, and six other chimpanzees that are no longer being used for research to a zoo across the Atlantic that has not received accreditation from major European or British zoo authorities, Wingham wildlife park, in Kent, England. Feuerstein and two other former researchers at Yerkes National Primate Research Center say the transfer will be detrimental to the chimpanzees\u2019 health and won\u2019t improve the chances of their species\u2019 survival. Plaintiffs are concerned that transporting the eight chimpanzees in cages on an international flight and housing them in a zoo that has not housed chimpanzees before would \u201cexacerbate the traumas they are already suffering as a result of the laboratory conditions and experimentation to which they have been exposed\u201d, according to the complaint. The move would also set a dangerous precedent and violate the spirit of the Endangered Species Act, they say. \u201cExport of the chimpanzees to an unaccredited zoo will not in any way enhance the survival of the species,\u201d the complaint says. The case is the first time a private facility has sought a permit from the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to ship abroad chimpanzees that were formerly used for research, after the federal government listed captive chimpanzees as protected under the Endangered Species Act last year, and on the heels of a halt in federal funding for research on chimpanzees from the National Institutes of Health. Plaintiffs, which include the New England Anti-Vivisection Society (NEAVS), London-based Cruelty-Free International, and Canada\u2019s Fauna Foundation, point to several decades of research and activism that has resulted in hundreds of formerly captive chimpanzees \u201cretiring\u201d from research and living healthier lives in accredited US sanctuaries \u2013 and note that several of these sanctuaries offered to take the chimps from Yerkes, which includes a price tag of up to $20,000 a year for their care. \u201cI want them to have a great future,\u201d said Feuerstein, who left Yerkes in 2003 and spent more than a decade working at Save the Chimps. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s being offered to them now.\u201d Feuerstein said the trip alone would pose \u201cunnecessary risks\u201d to the psychological and physical health of the endangered animals, adding that transporting chimpanzees on transatlantic flights has been \u201cextraordinarily unusual\u201d since the federal government declared chimps in the wild as endangered in 1975. She noted that they can respond to anesthesia by vomiting and could choke on their own vomit if not accompanied by a trained person on the flight. In contrast, the biologist has supervised the transportation by ground of nearly 300 chimpanzees from former research facilities to sanctuaries and has seen \u201cno fatalities or medical emergencies\u201d. The complaint also warns that placing the chimpanzees at Wingham could \u201caggravate, rather than relieve, their psychological distress and aberrant behaviors\u201d. Feuerstein said that chimpanzees held in captivity for research can exhibit behaviors similar to PTSD, including \u201cself-abuse, rocking back and forth, and increased aggression\u201d. These conditions \u201ccan be treated and alleviated\u201d, she added \u2013 \u201cwith the help of specialized care, in sanctuaries\u201d. Markus Wilder, animal collection curator for Wingham wildlife park, said in response: \u201cIt is incorrect that we have no previous experience with chimpanzees. We have animal care staff who have worked with chimpanzees, and our vet has extensive experience working with great apes.\u201d Wilder also said Wingham has been licensed by the UK to operate as a zoo. Even as this lawsuit remains ongoing, the chimps could be shipped to London as early as this week, according to the complaint. \u201cIt will be terrifying,\u201d Feuerstein said. \u201cThey\u2019ve never undergone anything like that in their lives.\u201d At least two US sanctuaries for chimpanzees \u201cretired\u201d from research have approached Yerkes about receiving the group, and NEAVS said it will pay for Georgia\u2019s care at any sanctuary. The FWS wouldn\u2019t comment on the case. A Yerkes spokeswoman, Lisa Newbern, sent press releases concerning the months-long case in an email, and wrote in a separate email that details about the offers from US sanctuaries were \u201cconfidential\u201d. Theodora Capaldo, NEAVS president, was critical of another wrinkle in the case, in which Yerkes and Wingham offered to pay $45,000 a year for five years to the Population and Sustainability Network, which in exchange would protect chimpanzees in the wild. \u201cThe whole concept of allowing individual endangered species to be exported for commercial use by giving money to a third party that does conservation work is essentially allowing them to buy a permit,\u201d Capaldo said. A review of communications between Tim Van Norman, charged with international permits for the FWS, and Joyce Cohen, associate director of animal resources at Yerkes, reveals that the federal agency suggested in an email that supporting the population network\u2019s work might be \u201cright up Yerkes\u2019 path\u201d. By the end of the month, Cohen wrote the federal agency of plans to make the donation as part of an \u201cenhancement\u201d to the research center\u2019s application. In other words, the research center, with the federal agency\u2019s help, had found a way to at least appear to satisfy the requirement for enhancing species survival. \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop groups from all over the world from trading in endangered species by donating a few thousand to conservation groups?\u201d Capaldo said."
"2||Scottish economy grows far more slowly than UK as a wholeThe Scottish economy is growing at a far slower rate than the UK as a whole, with the North Sea oil slump leading to a fall in GDP last year, the latest data shows. Scotland\u2019s gross domestic product declined by 1% in cash terms last year and has only grown by 4% since the recession, an analysis by the economist John McLaren has found. By comparison, the UK economy as a whole has grown by 23% in cash terms since 2008. McLaren said the decline in North Sea oil profitability was largely to blame for the fall, but Scotland\u2019s latest quarterly national accounts found that the country\u2019s trade balance and tax revenues had also been badly hit, greatly weakening its public accounts. The quarterly accounts, published as voters prepare for the Scottish parliament elections, followed HM Revenue and Customs data last month showing that North Sea tax receipts had slumped last year to the negligible figure of \u00a335m. \u201cScotland\u2019s economy continues to show worrying signs of North Sea related distress. Due to falling oil revenues, overall Scottish public sector revenues were lower in 2015 than at the height of the downturn in 2008,\u201d McLaren said. \u201cThere has also been a virtual standstill in GDP per capita since 2008, which has resulted in it falling below the level seen for the UK. The worsening trade position, largely with respect to the UK, is also a big worry, especially the fall in exports last year to the rest of the UK.\u201d As a percentage of GDP, the trade deficit with the rest of the UK and overseas markets was now -9.8%, the worst figure since Scottish devolution in 1999 and worse than that previous low of -8.5% in 2007. Scotland\u2019s deficit reached nearly \u00a315bn in cash terms, McLaren found, largely the result of a surge in imports from the rest of the UK. At the same time, public sector revenues also fell for the fourth year in a row, by nearly 12% in real terms. Scottish public spending is currently \u00a31,400 a head higher than the UK average. The latest government expenditure and revenue data for Scotland showed it had a public spending deficit in 2015 of \u00a315bn. The Scottish National party said the data showed that even with the oil industry slump, Scotland\u2019s per capita GDP was comparable to the UK average, at \u00a328,385 against \u00a328,634 for the UK. \u201cScotland remains the most prosperous part of the UK per head outside London and south-east England and is currently experiencing the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth since 2001,\u201d a spokesman said. Scotland\u2019s latest unemployment rates jumped above the UK average, adding to business nervousness, after a long period of relatively better figures. The SNP insisted the country\u2019s economy was still strong, with among the highest levels of overseas investment in the UK. \u201cWe have regularly outperformed the rest of the UK when it comes to jobs, with recent months seeing employment levels at record highs while our female employment rate is among the highest in Europe,\u201d the spokesman said."
"19||Ben Butler trial: daughter 'could have died after fall while imitating Peppa Pig'A six-year-old girl who was allegedly murdered by her father could have died trying to imitate the children\u2019s TV character Peppa Pig falling out of bed, his defence lawyer suggested in court. But a medical expert rejected the idea telling jurors at the trial of Ben Butler that the skull fractures suffered by his daughter, Ellie Butler, were the result of \u201cconsiderable blunt impact to the head\u201d. Butler, 36, is on trial at the Old Bailey accused of murdering his daughter in a fit of rage when he was left alone with her and another child at the family home on 28 October 2013. He denies the charges. The jury has been told Butler was found guilty of assaulting Ellie when she was a baby, in 2007. He was cleared on appeal and got the little girl back from care. She died 11 months later. Icah Peart QC, for Butler, put forward the possibility of an accidental death while cross-examining Anthony Risdon, a paediatric forensic pathologist, on his postmortem examination report. Risdon found the severity of Ellie\u2019s head injuries equated with considerable blunt impact, her head having either struck against a rigid surface or been hit with a blunt instrument, the jurors were told. After asking the professor if he was aware of the cartoon character Peppa Pig, Peart said a DVD featuring the character was found in Ellie\u2019s room and suggested she could have been jumping on her bed, mimicking the cartoon and fallen off the bed and hit her head. \u201cWhat I am talking about is someone jumping up and down on the bed and, as Peppa Pig does, jumps over backwards, falls down and hits her head on the concrete floor. That\u2019s the kind of momentum I am talking about. Is that the sort of thing that might possibly result in the kind of injuries you saw?\u201d Risdon replied: \u201cI have seen a large number of head injuries in children. I have never come across a scenario like that and I have never come across a short distance fall that results in a similar injury. It\u2019s completely outside of my experience, which is not inconsiderable.\u201d The court also heard from a doctor who insisted he was right nearly 10 years ago when he testified that Ellie was shaken as a baby. Neil Stoodley, a consultant neuro radiologist, told the murder trial that he had no reason to alter his opinion in light of new medical evidence. Butler, of Sutton, south-west London, denies murder and child cruelty. Ellie\u2019s mother, Jennie Gray, 36, also denies child cruelty but has admitted perverting the course of justice over allegations claiming she destroyed evidence and lied to police to protect Butler. The trial continues."
"7||Sa\u00fal \u2018Canelo\u2019 \u00c1lvarez plays fight game to be proud not loud in Las VegasFighting does not have to be loud. Fighters, most of them naturally timorous but encouraged to be professionally aggressive, do not have to \u201cplay the game\u201d. While it might be heresy for the off-stage suits whose job it is to pump up the volume, the most dangerous undertaking in sport can be conducted with mutual respect bordering on civility. Rarely has that concept been so manifest as in Las Vegas this week, when Sa\u00fal \u201cCanelo\u201d \u00c1lvarez and Amir Khan refused to be drawn into the cacophony. On Saturday night, they will try to rip the other\u2019s head off for as long as their world title fight lasts but, in preparation for that health-threatening experience, both champion and challenger have been quiet to the point of a cloister-level whisper. After their orchestrated arrival in the MGM Grand on Tuesday, a noisy event embellished by a mariachi band and designed solely for the excitement of the hundreds of fans who had gathered in the casino\u2019s lobby with their mobile phone cameras clicking constantly, \u00c1lvarez and Khan sat down with a few members of the media in a small VIP room nearby to share their considered thoughts. Unusually, it was enlightening \u2013 in a downbeat way. What we already know is that \u00c1lvarez, the WBC\u2019s middleweight champion, is dropping down nine pounds to 155lb to accommodate the move up through two divisions of Khan, who is a natural welterweight, a disparity in size that Floyd Mayweather, for one, would never have considered \u2013 when he fought and beat \u00c1lvarez in 2013, they also accommodated a catchweight, 152lb. Khan would have liked the limit set at 153lb but says he has been able to \u201ctrain up\u201d to the weight since last November, an unusually long and perhaps profitable preparation. \u00c1lvarez, four years younger at 25 but naturally a bigger man, will weigh around 175lb when they begin hostilities, about a stone heavier than Khan. Yet not even this core issue disturbed the good manners of the antagonists. If anything, it was the champion whose serenity slightly outshone the challenger\u2019s quiet confidence. This is a fight between two of the nicest guys in boxing. I asked \u00c1lvarez if the image we had of him \u2013 cool, respectful, relaxed \u2013 was so at odds with his \u201cfight face\u201d that it might be difficult for outsiders to appreciate how he makes the switch. He smiled and, through an interpreter, said: \u201cI keep my excitement within me but it\u2019s always there. As I grow older and gain more experience, I\u2019m more comfortable with everything. I\u2019m more mature, and I understand everything better.\u201d As for stepping into the historically significant Mexican celebration of Cinco de Mayo \u2013 a tradition stretching back to the more animated days of Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great honour. There\u2019s extra motivation to fight on this holiday.\u201d However, he will not be lured into producing a performance that goes against his gameplan or his nature. Steve Carp, who writes about boxing for this city\u2019s main newspaper, the Review-Journal, observed last year: \u201cHe\u2019s only 25, but if there\u2019s one thing \u00c1lvarez has learned in the 11 years he has been in boxing, it\u2019s don\u2019t say too much. And if you have to talk, don\u2019t say anything that may rile your opponent.\u201d The champion was true to that characterisation this week: \u201cPeople expect me to deliver a knockout but I never plan on it. If it comes, it comes.\u201d At times, it seemed he might be more likely to bore Khan into submission than hammer him physically. His eloquence flows from his gloves, though \u2013 no question. He is a silent assassin, a ruthless stalker who keeps opponents in a permanent state of anxiety. In 32 of his 48 fights since his professional debut, \u00c1lvarez has put his opponent away early. He can hit. Hard. Much of it is in his genes. For all his sanguinity, he can trace his fighting spirit to days scrapping on the streets of Juanacatl\u00e1n, a town of 25,000 people in rural Mexico. The family lived on a farm, where \u00c1lvarez learned to ride a horse, but he was just as fascinated by the exploits of his seven older brothers, all of whom have boxed. His combative nature was given substance by one simple physical feature: his red hair. He gladly adopted the nom de guerre, \u201cCanelo\u201d, to embrace the cinnamon-coloured topping on his head; he had no trouble engaging tormentors, all of whom left bloodied. It would have been seriously counterintuitive if the kid called Canelo did not learn how to handle himself in these elemental macho confrontations. It was his brother Rigo who triggered the switch from bare fists to gloved combat \u2013 and it was clear to young Sa\u00fal from the first punch he threw that this was a calling he could not ignore. Many of his early fights are unrecorded. It is often the way in Mexico. Fighting comes naturally but is not always recompensed. \u00c1lvarez got lucky. He had a talent and inclination for it as well as single-mindedness. His demeanour disarms, as well. He would not look out of place in a bank. However, \u00c1lvarez is his own bank. For this little dust-up he will earn $9m. Khan gets $5m. The winner can expect far greater returns up the road, possibly against Gennady Golovkin, the best middleweight in boxing. Although Khan sounded less than enthusiastic this week about that prospect, \u00c1lvarez has no choice but to accept the challenge. He is, after all, more physically suited for the task of fighting at 160lb \u2013 and he would not be able to show his face in Juanacatl\u00e1n were he to somehow wriggle free of the ultimate challenge in his sport. That is why this fight is so important to him. He will not mention Golovkin\u2019s name but there cannot be a night when he goes to sleep without imagining what such a fight would be like. Later probably than sooner, he will know."
"3||Top Gear executive Katie Taylor leaves BBC StudiosA BBC executive who has overseen Strictly Come Dancing and the new Top Gear has announced her departure, becoming the fifth senior figure to leave the corporation\u2019s new production arm, which launched less than a week ago.

"2||Sainsbury's sales and profits fall amid price cutsSainsbury\u2019s has revealed a 14% drop in annual profits after it was forced to slash prices to compete with the rise of the discounters. Sales fell 1.1% to \u00a325.8bn in the year to 12 March and underlying profits slid to \u00a3587m, higher than the \u00a3571m predicted by analysts, as the company said it had maintained market share in a \u201ccompetitive, deflationary environment\u201d. The retailer was boosted by an 8.5% rise in clothing sales and a near 9% rise in online sales, as well as more than 9% growth at its convenience stores as it opened 69 more Sainsbury\u2019s Local outlets. In contrast, sales at supermarkets fell by 1.6%. Mike Coupe, the chief executive, said the supermarket was making good progress in a challenging market. Including one-off items such as property writedowns, Sainsbury\u2019s returned to the black, booking a profit of \u00a3548m after a \u00a372m loss last year. The company booked \u00a3101m in profits from the sale of property but also spent \u00a359m on improving systems at its bank and \u00a315m on costs relating to its planned acquisition of Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos. Income from suppliers, which Sainsbury\u2019s revealed for the first time after pressure from regulators in the wake of the Tesco accounting scandal, slumped 42% to \u00a3371m as Sainsbury\u2019s said it had slashed the number of supplier-funded promotions in favour of cutting prices. Improvements in the quality of some foods also helped Sainsbury\u2019s hold its market share at 16.5% in the 12 weeks to 24 April compared with the same period a year before, according to the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel, as it outperformed major rivals. The supermarket\u2019s sales were down 0.4%, the first fall this year, according to Kantar. But sales at Asda slumped 5.1%, while sales at Morrisons, which has sold off its convenience store chain, slipped by 2.6% and Tesco\u2019s sales were down 1.3% over the period. In contrast, discounter Aldi increased sales by 12.5% and Lidl by 15.4%. Coupe said it was difficult to assess whether the Kantar figures presaged a broader consumer slowdown or whether shoppers were just reacting to an early Easter accompanied by colder and wetter weather. But he warned that shoppers would continue to buy fewer items in supermarkets and turn increasingly to convenience stores, online and discounters. \u201cThe UK food retail landscape is changing rapidly,\u201d he said. \u201cRetailing doesn\u2019t stand still and we need to challenge the business to move with the time. That is quite a significant rationale in acquiring Argos.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s is expecting to complete the \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos\u2019s parent company, Home Retail Group, in the autumn but Coupe refused to be drawn on further details of his plans for the company. However, he said the acquisition would put Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cat the sweet spot of where customers are moving to\u201d. Sainsbury\u2019s said sales at established stores slid by 0.9% for the year, but trading has been on an improving trend with the supermarket revealing its first quarter of growth in more than two years in the final three months of its financial year. Coupe said: \u201cIt remains a challenging market. We are expecting deflation to continue through the summer and clearly that has a significant impact on our sales line.\u201d He added that Sainsbury\u2019s would continue to cut prices to remain competitive. Overall prices in the grocery market had fallen by 4% over the past two years and he said falls in commodity prices and strong competition meant deflation could continue throughout this year. Coupe said shoppers had more money in their pockets to spend but were tending to spend it outside traditional retail \u2013 on holidays and new cars. Despite that shift, Sainsbury\u2019s is planning to open five new supermarkets and up to 50 convenience stores this year, compared with a net four supermarkets and 66 convenience stores last year. It will also refurbish 25 supermarkets after just seven refurbishments last year where it trialled new ideas such as expanded takeaway areas. Shares dived more than 6% to 267.8p, despite better than expected profits, as analysts expressed concern that the business\u2019s profit margins and sales continue to fall. Operating profits slid to 2.74% from 3.07% in the previous year \u2013 taking them in the opposite direction to Sainsbury\u2019s target of 3% to 3.5% by 2019 at the latest. Dave McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said: \u201cLife is only going to get tougher, at a time when management is likely to be distracted by the planned Argos acquisition.\u201d Meanwhile, Sainsbury\u2019s is to offer mortgages from next year as it hopes its bank will deliver growth which is difficult to find in the grocery aisles. John Rogers, the supermarket\u2019s finance director, said customers expected Sainsbury\u2019s to offer mortgages alongside its current products which include insurance, savings accounts and credit cards. \u201cWe know from research that customers really trust the Sainsbury\u2019s Bank brand and from a customer perspective makes a lot of sense. He said mortgage lending would be underpinned by a combination of customer deposits held by the bank and borrowing in the wholesale market and the mortgages would help balance risk. Coupe said expanding Sainsbury\u2019s bank was part of the retailer\u2019s three year plan to invest in growing markets such as online, convenience stores and services. In the year to March 2015 underlying profit rose 17%. However, the cost of taking over systems from the bank\u2019s former co-owner Lloyds Banking Group and a cut in the interchange fees charged to retailers by banks have hit profits growth since then. Underlying operating profit rose 4.8% in the past year and Sainsbury\u2019s said the launch of mortgages will mean a 10% fall in underlying operating profit in the year ahead."
"22||The rights and wrongs of testing 10-year-olds on modal verbsI enjoyed your articles on the kids\u2019 strike (Five reasons parents are boycotting primary schools over Sats, 3 May), which emphasise the anxiety caused by excessive testing of children, and the reporting of league tables. Testing of children does not need to be stressful. Excessive stress results from the use that we as a society make of the test results. Children are being asked to carry the responsibility for evaluating their teachers, by performing well in tests. It is unfair of society to ask that of them. Teachers are evaluated, not on how well they teach (within their control), but on how well their students do in tests (not entirely within their control). Parents are encouraged to use the resulting league tables to choose a school for their children. The pressure on schools to report good results is transferred on to teachers, which is transferred on to the pupils. A teacher is a very important figure in the eyes of children, and they may not want to feel that it could be their fault that the teacher is not rated well (because of their poor test results). I\u2019ve believed for a long time that inspectors would be far more effective if their remit was to enthuse, support and enhance the skills of teachers. Then the teachers could pass this culture of enthusiasm and support on to their children. Just think of what we might then achieve. Hilary Watt London \u2022 I was appalled by the naivety of those parents and indeed teachers who feel that fair testing of children is wrong. I was state-school educated and was 25th in the entrance exam for Manchester Grammar \u2013 and the support, weekly testing at school, and help from my parents, enabled me to compete in the global economy. Oriental children work 18 hours a day and win all of the prizes at leading world universities while British young people look on with wonder. Unless we test we cannot make education better, especially for the poorest. Peter Booth Altrincham, Greater Manchester \u2022 As a lecturer to English language university students on analysing English grammar, I was both surprised and horrified to see that the same ability to label grammatical categories and parts of speech, such as determiners and subordinating conjunctions, is expected of 10-year-olds in their English Sats test. Nicky Morgan, the education secretary, defends the government position on this by saying that children need to know the basics. However, it seems that she has failed to grasp the basic fact that labelling language is not the same as using it effectively \u2013 just as labelling the parts of the engine does not enable you to drive effectively, and that this knowledge does not contribute to the very necessary basic English language skill of being able to express oneself effectively, both orally and in writing. Training children for the new tests is resulting not only in a reduction in teaching time devoted to developing their oral and writing skills, but also in a reduction in both creativity and enthusiasm for language development in these young children. Jill Cosh Cambridge \u2022 My heart goes out to primary school children facing the new Sats tests. I took O-level Latin and A-level English but I had never heard of \u201cmodal verbs\u201d. (Wikipedia tells me they are used to indicate likelihood, ability, permission, or obligation.) I must begin coaching my pre-school grandchildren at once. I don\u2019t want them to be picked on in reception because they are the only ones who can\u2019t distinguish between epistemic, deontic and dynamic modality. Alan Woodley Northampton \u2022 Does it matter if schools minister Nick Gibb does not know whether \u201cafter\u201d is a subordinating conjunction or a preposition in a specific sentence? Of course not \u2013 apart from helping him to avoid public humiliation. Such arcane analysis will never help anyone to write more accurately or more expressively. After (used as a preposition here of course) 40 years as a secondary school English teacher, I know that what would really help is if 11-year-olds had a good grasp of how to use basic punctuation accurately, particularly the full stop, and had experienced the thrill of writing about interesting things in an interesting way. Oh \u2013 and had read some fabulous and inspiring books en route. Mary Smith Bearsted, Kent \u2022 Zoe Williams (Do we want humans or algorithms to teach our children?, 2 May) prompts a couple of thoughts in this long-standing school governor and statistician. There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding here. What is the testing for? Is it to measure how individual children are doing or is it to measure schools? The minister seems to be under the illusion that one measure can be used for both. Schools are very complicated entities, which can be measured in all sorts of ways \u2013 number of GCSEs, added value based on deprivation \u2013 but also: number of counselling sessions required by over-stressed pupils, number of pupils self-harming, number of looked-after children getting to university rather than prison, number of teachers off with stress, amount of money spent by wealthier parents on tutors, etc. Pupils are infuriatingly even more variable in their potential, poor choice of parents and motivation. Reducing these measures to just one to create a league table to find the \u201cbest\u201d pupil or \u201cbest\u201d school is simplistic at best and potentially highly damaging. It is a well-worn cliche to say that weighing a pig regularly does not make it grow more or quicker, but I was raised on a farm and I know a happy well-fed pig when I see one, just as I know a happy well-run school with pupils I would trust to run the country in my old age. Sadly I do not think that Nicky Morgan does. Dr Martin Price Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan \u2022 Zoe Williams\u2019s rubbishing of the phonics screening check shows a failure to understand the research in this area. The superiority of a phonics approach to the teaching of literacy has been known for at least half a century. Only last week the Guardian reported its beneficial effects on the reading of low achievers and pupils with English as a second language (Phonics method helps close attainment gaps, study shows, 25 April). The specific benefits of the PSC are difficult to demonstrate, as the 2015 National Foundation for Educational Research evaluation makes clear, mainly because it was introduced in all schools at the same time and ran alongside other phonics initiatives. However, the NFER report did find that teachers improved their approach to teaching phonics following introduction of the PSC and that they used its results to modify programmes of work for individuals and groups. Moreover, pupils\u2019 phonic knowledge as measured by the PSC has improved every year since its introduction. Brian McDevitt Knutsford, Cheshire \u2022 As an aged parent and now a grandparent, I do not understand the uproar regarding Sats. Children only get worried about them because they overhear parents and staff \u2013 plus the media \u2013 saying they should not exist. Perhaps if children were tested termly tests would become the norm and a better understanding of pupils\u2019 abilities might be formed, allowing the highlighting of areas where teachers should be concentrating their lessons. Or perhaps we should go back to the bad old days when we were taught by rote and tested weekly on various subjects, with main exams at the end of terms. Those who were schooled pre-1980s are better educated in general knowledge and can write legibly and speak coherently on many subjects. The majority left school with the ability to get on with their lives. Whether it is the fault of successive governments, parents who cannot be bothered to assist their children or a few teachers who are not in the profession as a vocation, who knows? But I do have concerns as to what sort of a future lies ahead for the next couple of generations. Kay Everett Blandford Forum, Dorset Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"
"18||Questions for the Women\u2019s Equality partyWhen I heard about the Women\u2019s Equality party from the irrepressibly ebullient Sandi Toksvig I was intrigued. It emphatically wants to address the gender pay gap which would solve many of the world\u2019s economic and social ills. Although affordable childcare (free for the first nine months) will enable women to work, many are compelled to take part-time jobs or short-term contracts with barely any rights and poor pay. How will the party address this? It talks of parental leave of six weeks \u2013 but some mothers take a career break, opting to stay at home with their baby, and then find it daunting to get back into work. How will WEP support these women? Even if fathers take their two weeks\u2019 paternity leave, this does not constitute equal parenting. What about mothers who suffer maternal mental illness? Suicide is the primary indirect cause of maternal death in the UK. What is its mental health policy stance? Encouraging girls to go into science is positive, but encouraging girls from poor and ethnically diverse backgrounds to go into the arts, film, TV and broadcasting is equally important. The dearth of representation means this realm is increasingly becoming the preserve of those with affluent parents. If more ethnically diverse women were represented, it would contribute to a richer cultural landscape. The WEP must campaign for a wider range of policies representing women from varying socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. Otherwise it could end up being a failed white middle-class feminist experiment. Sanchita Islam London \u2022 Sitting on the train travelling from Wiltshire to London, I read that the actress Emma Thompson is backing the Women\u2019s Equality party and that this is largely because she believes WEP is \u201cputting issues of caring \u2013 for children and for the elderly \u2013 at the top of its agenda\u201d (Why I\u2019m voting Women\u2019s Equality, Letters, 3 May). I am confused. I have seen no evidence of WEP policy proposals to treat caregivers equally, or to properly support families with care responsibilities, but I hope I am wrong. I often attend meetings about caregiving, and also volunteer for a family counselling charity. Adults engaged in care work, women and men, contribute hugely in ways that can\u2019t always be easily counted. This matters for children, teenagers and the elderly, as well as people experiencing poor mental or physical health. The Office for National Statistics values this work at \u00a3343bn. But there\u2019s an urgent need for policies that address the current hefty penalty against time spent caring for family members. Encouraging a move away from family care towards care in the paid economy, so it counts in GDP, isn\u2019t quite the same as supporting unpaid loving care, caring and caregiving. Care work is equal work and it\u2019s time it wasn\u2019t treated like a second class activity by policymakers in all parties. If WEP has new ideas I would be interested to hear about them. Marie Peacock Salisbury, Wiltshire \u2022 I too would be shocked if it were true that 85% of young women in London are sexually harassed every day. The actual YouGov figure was based on a sample of 96 young people (18-24), both male and female, only a small proportion of whom were Londoners: 52% said they had suffered unwanted attention of a sexual nature in the last 12 months, and another 33% some time earlier. Nothing to be proud of, but not quite the outrageous level of harassment suggested by your correspondent.

"9||Leicester City\u2019s place in an unequal worldThe reaction to the wonderful achievement of Leicester City in winning the Premier League is also a sad reflection on the ever-increasing inequality in our society. Nearly 40 years ago my team, Nottingham Forest, came up from the second division with one of the worst promotion records in history and proceeded to win the league, beating, among others, possibly the best Liverpool team ever. They then won the European Cup twice. As Leicester were already playing in the top league and had finished the previous season with a terrific burst of form, it is debatable which is the more amazing achievement. However, the depth of reaction to the two events is very instructive. In those days, you could quite easily accept that a \u201clesser\u201d team had some chance of competing against the accepted giants, and Forest\u2019s wins still had a relatively healthy sense of perspective. But now, we hear that Leicester\u2019s performance is \u201cthe greatest ever in sporting history\u201d, presumably in view of the odds against overcoming the colossal inequalities that have been allowed to develop in football. Football \u2013 as ever, a microcosm of the wider world. Jan Wiczkowski Prestwich, Greater Manchester \u2022 Your mountains of deserved praise for Leicester City\u2019s Premier League title omit one small fact that helps reflect the scale of the achievement.

Ian Croft Leicester \u2022 I understand that the Leicester City football club have come top of some football league or other. I do think you should have celebrated this achievement.

My partner is a middle manager in the public sector. She has received a 1.2% pay rise and an increased income tax personal allowance, but these have been more than cancelled out by a whopping increase in national insurance, so she is worse off now than before. National insurance is income tax by another name and is paid disproportionately by those on low and middle incomes.

"0||Trump doubles down on critiques of Clinton after Indiana primary winFresh off an overwhelming victory in Indiana that made him the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump wasted little time in previewing his tactics against Hillary Clinton in a general election. Trump has spent the last year batting away his Republican opponents, largely by turning them into caricatures. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush was \u201clow-energy\u201d, Florida senator Marco Rubio was \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and Texas senator Ted Cruz, who suspended his campaign on Tuesday, \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d. Former secretary of state Clinton will be known as \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d. During an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on Wednesday, Trump attached several other labels to his likely opponent. She was \u201cunqualified\u201d, he said, and \u201cshould suffer\u201d for her use of a private email server while in office. The system was \u201crigged\u201d in her favor. \u201cShe should not be allowed to run in the election,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe should suffer like other people have suffered who have done far less than she has \u2026 and here she is running for president like nothing happened.\u201d The former reality TV star invoked comments last month by the other remaining Democratic candidate, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, that Clinton was \u201cunqualified\u201d to be president. \u201cBernie Sanders said she\u2019s got poor judgment,\u201d Trump said. Sanders made his remarks as tensions escalated before the 19 April primary in New York. The senator later walked back his statement, but not before it had been seized upon by Republicans. The challenge for those Republicans, though, remains that as far as Trump is concerned, nothing is off limits \u2013 even if it risks turning off large swaths of voters. The real estate mogul has already dug up Clinton\u2019s past: earlier this year, dredging up the Monica Lewinsky scandal, he likened former president Bill Clinton to a sexual predator. Also, last week, he handed Clinton a rallying cry by saying she was playing \u201cthe woman card\u201d and had little else to offer than her gender. Clinton\u2019s team responded with a full-scale \u201cwoman card\u201d fundraising drive that raised $2.4m in three days, 40% of which her campaign said came from first-time donors. Such moments offer Clinton a chance to appeal to Republicans frustrated by what they view as the breakdown of their party. Some GOP strategists in Washington were willing to declare their support for Clinton as early as Tuesday, when it became apparent that Trump would win Indiana and all but end the prospect of a contested convention in July. The Clinton campaign on Wednesday circulated a list featuring some of them, as well as quotes from other Republican lawmakers and prominent conservatives who said they would never back Trump. To further its case that Trump is unpalatable to his own party, Team Clinton released a new web video in the afternoon compiling footage of Trump\u2019s former Republican opponents attacking him on the stump and in interviews. Featured in the video are Cruz referring to Trump as \u201cutterly immoral\u201d; Florida senator Marco Rubio blasting him as a \u201ccon artist\u201d and \u201cthe most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency\u201d; former Florida governor Jeb Bush saying \u201che needs therapy\u201d; and multiple clips from an anti-Trump speech delivered earlier this year by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Although Clinton has long made it a staple of her stump speeches to condemn Trump as a demagogue, in particular regarding his anti-immigration and anti-Muslim rhetoric, it was only last week that her campaign began to pivot toward the general election in earnest. The campaign named state directors in key battleground states, seeking to turn its attention to a ground operation geared for the general election \u2013 a critical area in which Trump may lag behind. And while Clinton has continued to campaign in primary states, she made a stop on Tuesday in the must-win general election state of Ohio, to pitch her economic agenda. Many working-class white voters in the so-called Rust Belt have been drawn to the populist appeal of both Sanders and Trump. During his victory speech on Tuesday, echoing once more an attack used by Sanders, Trump launched into a critique of Clinton\u2019s record on trade by tying her to Bill Clinton\u2019s landmark North American Free Trade Agreement. To win back the White House, Republicans will nonetheless need to secure more than a majority of white voters. With a nominee whose unfavorability ratings position him as the least-popular nominee of either party in modern history, and whose primary campaign has alienated nearly every other demographic in the country, that will remain an uphill climb."
"25||Howard Hodgkin: 'I felt like an outcast in the art world'\u201cI hate painting,\u201d says Howard Hodgkin, one of the world\u2019s greatest living painters. \u201cMost of the time it\u2019s irrelevant. It doesn\u2019t mean enough, ever, quite.\u201d The 83-year-old English artist is in New York for an exhibition of new and recent works at Gagosian gallery, entitled From Memory. It is an exhilarating display by an artist at the peak of his powers: Hodgkin may be elderly but his work is far from frail. We meet in the gallery along with his partner of 32 years, the music writer Antony Peattie. Hodgkin\u2019s hair is silver and short, his eyes rheumy and penetrating. Dressed in blues and blacks, his subdued clothing is in contrast to the voluptuous backdrop \u2013 nobody does colour quite like Hodgkin, and this exhibition is no exception. Hodgkin is now more prolific than ever. \u201cI realize there isn\u2019t much time left,\u201d says the artist, who won the Turner prize in 1985 and was knighted in 1992. Old age has been freeing: \u201cLots of things that I used to worry about in my work, I don\u2019t any more because I know the answers to them. It clarifies things wonderfully.\u201d What he wants to achieve with his art has become \u201cmore straightforward\u201d, he says: \u201cmaximum expression\u201d. The paintings evoke private memories and are saturated in emotion. Joy in its abundance leaps from Love Song, a sizeable work on wood daubed in splashes of blue, white and green. Dirty Window feels grubby and sexy and secret, as does Bedclothes, from the same years (2014-15). There is tumult in the oranges, reds, greens, browns and plum of Blackmail, while Puddle is intimate in its simplicity, in its blue smears and empty space. From Memory is a riff on melancholy in browns, blues and blacks. We head to Hodgkin\u2019s beloved India in The Rains Came, as the heavens drench the dirt, while Green Monsoon is darker, closer to the heart of things. Hodgkin\u2019s feelings run famously close to the surface. At several points during our interview his shoulders shudder with sudden emotion as he stifles a sob or laugh, eyes widening in shock at each eruption. He is \u201ca man who loves and hates with a passion, and is very emotional. He will cry very easily and flares up, both in terms of colour and of temper, very quickly,\u201d said the Tate director, Nicholas Serota, in 2001. Serota, who gave Hodgkin his first museum show in 1976, said then that Hodgkin\u2019s passions had become \u201cmuch more evident in the paintings over the last 15 years or so\u201d. Now, 15 years later, this is truer than ever. Ghosts of the past are on Hodgkin\u2019s mind. He remembers the policeman who said that Hodgkin\u2019s career choice seemed like a very good idea when, as a young boy he ran away from school because he wanted to be an artist. He weeps at the memory of his father and a dead relative known as \u201crich cousin within the family\u201d, the painter Eliot Hodgkin. \u201cHe was one of the most influential people in my life \u2026 an amazing person. He was the first man I\u2019ve ever come across who had bespoke suits made of silk,\u201d Hodgkin says, smiling in amazement. He remembers cruelties well, too. His mother, a \u201ccomplicated woman\u201d whose \u201conly freedom was to seduce almost any grand person that she happened to come across\u201d was mindful of the social opprobrium in having a runaway artist as a son and encouraged him to become a diplomat (\u201cI said I would have started world wars\u201d). Hodgkin, who once said he found his voice very young but didn\u2019t quite know what to do with it, did not receive recognition until the 1970s, much later than peers such as David Hockney. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt I was a great success,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a while I felt like an outcast in the art world because nobody really seemed to take what I did seriously at all.\u201d This led to periods of despair \u2013 about 50 years ago he contemplated jumping in front of a train. \u201cFocus in particular was essential, which was very difficult to do in the context of an ordinary middle-class life,\u201d he says. \u201cEventually, everything fell into place.\u201d Now, recognition has come \u2013 \u201cat last\u201d, he says. Asked when and how his confidence developed, Hodgkin gestures at Peattie. Great love helps, he says, shrugging. Another \u201cgigantic step\u201d was a major exhibition of his works at London\u2019s Hayward Gallery in 1996, which marked the moment, he says, \u201cwhen I began to feel like yes, I could\u201d. I went to see the show as a schoolgirl and it made me determined to work with art: I\u2019d never seen such audacious colour or pictures that refused to stay in their frames. It felt like permission to see the world differently, and I left the Hayward amazed that art could do such a thing, in such a modern way. Hodgkin famously paints up to the very edge of the painting, often covering the frame. It is a form of control, making sure that the object\u2019s completeness cannot be interrupted by a frame placed around it by somebody else. For similar reasons, he paints on board instead of canvas: \u201cA firm surface won\u2019t answer back. It just remains there, and that\u2019s very important to have. So much of my working isn\u2019t fixed, so it\u2019s wonderful that this is fixed, it\u2019s firm; there it is. I\u2019ve always thought that the first thing that painting should be is a thing \u2013 paintings should be like objects that exist firmly.\u201d Why is that so important \u2013 because everything else is so fleeting? \u201cProbably, yes. They have to be complete in themselves.\u201d Painting remains a gruelling endeavour. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly lonely,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t make up for it by \u2013 and don\u2019t misunderstand this \u2013 by the interest of you. It\u2019s still very lonely. Being alone in the studio \u2013 I don\u2019t paint listening to music, I don\u2019t paint surrounded by the objects I collect. It\u2019s just me.\u201d The loneliness is \u201cessential\u201d, says Hodgkin, whose London studio is relentlessly white and bright, with no corners to hide in. The artist has said that the biggest challenge is to sit still, holding one\u2019s own hand and resisting the urge to rush at the painting. But his patience has increased with age: these new works are more restrained than the earlier paintings, leaving more unsaid. He is preparing for an exhibition at London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery of his portraits \u2013 a form that, as an abstract artist, he is not often associated with. But he painted lots of portraits in the 1960s of artists such as Patrick Caulfield, whom he admired greatly. The museum would like him to paint a new portrait or two, though Hodgkin doesn\u2019t yet have a subject in mind. He falls silent for a few moments then says: \u201cSo many people that I loved and admired and so on are dead already. I\u2019ve reached that age. Somehow it never seemed real to me when I read about it happening to other people.\u201d Surveying the Gagosian exhibition, he says: \u201cLike so many ageing artists, I don\u2019t think this is the best work \u2013 I am sure there is more to come.\u201d Does he allow himself to experience moments of triumph in his work? \u201cYes, but they\u2019re not real because they can\u2019t be,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the triumph lasts a very short time indeed.\u201d For Hodgkin, the success of each work is only ever a lonely note in a larger song, and so he keeps painting.

"1||El Salvador arrests negotiators of gang truce in new get-tough policyIt was heralded as a bold attempt to curb decades of violence and credited with slashing El Salvador\u2019s murder rate by half. But four years after a truce was declared between the country\u2019s two main gang factions, the controversial ceasefire has been recast as a criminal conspiracy \u2013 and its protagonists arrested as gang sympathisers. Sixteen people have been detained in a series of high-profile raids, as authorities used new legislation outlawing dialogue with gang members to justify the arrests. Psychologists, teachers, senior police officers and prison wardens were among those detained for their role in negotiating the 2012 truce between the powerful Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Calle 18 gangs. The most prominent figure caught in the roundup was Ra\u00fal Mijango, a former leftwing guerrilla who fought alongside members of the current FMLN (Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front) government in the 12-year civil war. Mijango, who was part of the team which negotiated the truce on behalf of the previous FMLN government, is accused of illicit association and trafficking of illicit goods. The arrests come as the government of President Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n rolls out a new mano dura \u2013 or iron fist \u2013 security plan which authorities hope will stem the killing by forcing the gangs into submission. The nominally leftwing government is hastily planning makeshift prisons to cope with projected mass arrests and has tacitly authorised the military and police to adopt a \u201cshoot to kill\u201d policy toward suspected gang members. \u201cThose thinking about a new truce should not do so. We will not allow this to happen,\u201d the chief prosecutor said on Tuesday. The arrests were hailed by the majority of citizens and the mainstream media, who squarely blame MS-13 and Calle 18 for the bloodletting which has devastated the tiny Central American country. The violence has steadily escalated since the truce started to collapse in 2013; last year was the bloodiest since the war ended in 1992, which left El Salvador ranked as the most violent country in the world. But leading experts condemned the arrests as politically motivated and warned of potentially dire consequences. Adam Blackwell, the former representative of the Organisation of American States (OAS) who helped facilitate the negotiations, said: \u201cThis is a vindictive sacrificing of the lambs \u2013 most of the 18 people arrested are decent public servants. Truce or no truce, the authorities need a communications channel. Are they going to arrest the Red Cross who are working in the prisons as well?\u201d Half of those arrested held low-level administrative positions. Yet senior negotiators such as bishop Fabio Colindres and the current defence minister, Gen David Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s, were not detained. The FMLN first came to power in 2009 amid promises to use crime prevention and social programmes to tackle the escalating crime rates, which they inherited from the rightwing National Republican Alliance (Arena). In early 2012, government officials and Catholic church representatives brought together rival gang leaders who agreed to stop killings and reprisal homicides. The murder rate immediately fell by a half. But the truce was meant to be the first part of a negotiated peace process. The ceasefire should have been followed by improvements in the inhumane, overcrowded prisons and the introduction of prevention and reinsertion programmes within marginalised communities. This never happened. Former president Mauricio Funes was unable to persuade international lenders to help, and private donors were prevented from funding programmes after the US declared MS-13 a terrorist group. By the middle of 2014, the truce had collapsed. Last year, almost 6,700 people were murdered, including an average of 30 a day in August. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle it [the truce] lasted so long,\u201d said Blackwell. \u201cYes, we worked with people who\u2019d done some terrible things, but it was never a quid pro quo situation. We weren\u2019t trying to go to heaven, just trying to avoid going to hell.\u201d An academic gang expert, speaking anonymously because of the threat to criminalise those working with gangs, told the Guardian: \u201cAt the height of the truce, the homicide rate was five per day; now it\u2019s 25. You don\u2019t just walk away from that type of reduction \u2013 you bow out because you have nothing to offer the gangs as there is just no money for prevention and reinsertion programmes, and mano dura is not only popular, it\u2019s cheaper.\u201d The truce was controversial from the start, in part because the dialogue and subsequent deal were clouded in secrecy. Fragile public support nosedived amid rumours that the truce strengthened and enriched loathed gang leaders. Public disapproval increased further after unsubstantiated claims that while murders had decreased, disappearances increased after the ceasefire. Paolo Luers, another of the principal negotiators, who was not indicted yesterday but is under investigation, said blaming the truce for the country\u2019s violence has widespread public and political support. \u201cI\u2019ve never concealed my participation in meetings with mediators and gang members, but crimes were never planned. These meetings were used to discuss possibilities for preventing crimes,\u201d Luers said. \u201cWhat worries me most is how the gang members will react, as now there is no way to talk to them in order to prevent madness.\u201d"
"2||Barclays to sell off more than 100m shares in Africa subsidiariesBarclays has kickstarted the sale of parts of its African operations, eyed by its former chief executive Bob Diamond. In a sale that could raise \u00a3750m for the bank, Barclays announced it was placing 103.6m shares \u2013 or around a 12.2% stake \u2013 in Barclays Africa with institutional investors. Barclays wants to reduce its 62.5% share in Barclays Africa, which is listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange, to below 20%. Diamond is part of a consortium that is trying to bid for the operation. Last month, Diamond said the \u201cconsortium has committed long-term strategic investors. The funding is in place. There is support for this potential transaction\u201d. Diamond was speaking in a presentation to investors in the London-listed African-based bank Atlas Mara, which he formed after being forced out of Barclays in the wake of the Libor-rigging crisis in 2012. Barclays said Public Investment Corporation, a South African state pension fund which already has a more than 5% stake in the African business, was acting as an anchor investor in the share placing. The sell down leaves Barclays with an influential 50.1% stake in Barclays Africa. While the selloff could be seen a blow to Diamond\u2019s ambitions, the sale had been anticipated by the market. Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays since the start of December, said the sale was \u201can important first step as we seek to reduce our shareholding in Barclays Africa to a level that achieves accounting and regulatory deconsolidation\u201d. In March, when he presented first quarter results, Staley had announced the plan to pull back in Africa and cut the dividend this year and next. \u201cAs we said at our first quarter results, we continue to explore opportunities to reduce our shareholding, including capital market and strategic options. \u201cBarclays Africa is an important partner, and we are working closely with local management, including planning for the operational separation of the two businesses in a way that will preserve value for shareholders in both the Barclays and Barclays Africa groups.\u201d Bloomberg had earlier quoted the national regulator expressing concern about the nature of the bid. \u201cAs a regulator we won\u2019t be comfortable with a private equity play for any of the banks,\u201d the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, Kuben Naidoo, said."
"7||Somehow stays on target for Epsom after hard-fought Cheshire Oaks winEpsom, and the Oaks, is the target for Somehow, who did not look like justifying her short price for the Listed Cheshire Oaks on Wednesday until well inside the final furlong. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s filly, a daughter of the dual Oaks winner Alexandrova, was never travelling with any fluency and still had plenty of ground to make up turning for home, but Ryan Moore managed to find enough of a finish to grind out a half-length defeat of Moorside. \u201cShe was very asleep going along and I thought she was going to have to be lucky, but Ryan gave her a class ride,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe was very happy with her when he came in. \u201cNo matter what you work her with, she just works to them, no matter how fast or slow they are. I think mentally she just hasn\u2019t really clicked in yet, but she\u2019s probably always going to be a laid-back filly. Around here, it\u2019s a very quick place if you\u2019re sleeping a bit. When we do a bit with her next week we\u2019ll be hoping that she\u2019s come alive, that it will click her into gear.\u201d Somehow is top-priced at 20-1 for the Oaks, in a market headed by her stable companion Minding, the winner of the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket on Sunday. No Heretic was among the five-day entries for a hurdle race at Newton Abbot on Wednesday afternoon. Instead, Nicky Henderson opted to run him in the Chester Cup, and even in a year when Henderson has already pulled off several impressive feats, it proved to be one of his smartest decisions. No Heretic had not lined up for a Flat race since September 2013 as he went to post, and had only one start of any kind in that long absence, in a novice hurdle at Newbury last month. He was more than ready for this unique test, however, and stayed on strongly in the closing stages to beat Nakeeta by a short-head, with Silver Concorde, the winner of Cheltenham\u2019s Grade One Festival Bumper in 2014, another one-and-a-quarter away in third. Henderson, however, was not here to see it, and instead watched in the owners\u2019 and trainers\u2019 bar at Kelso as Jamie Spencer edged No Heretic to victory. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a fixed view about hurdles for him, and we wanted to see if we could plunder something like this,\u201d Henderson said later. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see how he comes through it, but he\u2019ll be Flat racing for now, no doubt about that. We can keep the hurdles up our sleeves until the autumn. He had a very good draw [in stall four], which helped. We had to make the most of that [and] he was tanking all the way through.\u201d"
"2||How loyal are you to your loyalty cards?If you have a wallet, chances are there\u2019s at least one loyalty card stashed in there, be it a dog-eared coffee stamp card or a Boots Advantage card. But with many major shops and supermarkets cutting back on their perks \u2013 Tesco is scrapping its Clubcard Boost events and Nectar has halved the value of points you receive for shopping at Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 loyalty schemes are becoming increasingly worthless. So, does anyone still use them? We took to the streets to find out. Sandra Pihlak, 27, student I\u2019ve never had any loyalty cards, but a lot of my friends do. They take up way too much space in your wallet and are just another ploy to get you hooked on buying things you don\u2019t need. Laura Butler, 27, physiotherapist I\u2019ve got loads, from a Nectar card and Boots to Mac and a few other ones from places I don\u2019t even shop at. My Nectar card sometimes knocks some money off, but not much. The rest I hardly ever use. It\u2019s very easy to sign up for loyalty schemes, so I\u2019m a sucker for them. My wallet probably needs cleaning out. Laurence Johnson, 43, engineer I have a Tesco Clubcard, but it has rarely been useful. The only points scheme that seems to pay off is Avios air miles. Most others turn out to be useless. Carlos Ferreira, 32, receptionist I don\u2019t have any loyalty cards because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. More often than not it\u2019s to scam you into shopping more and it\u2019s just not worth the effort. I have a friend with a Boots card who spends more than he should just to get points on his card. Anabelle Smith, 40, solicitor I have a lot of cards \u2013 Nectar, House of Fraser, Body Shop, Superdrug. None of them really pay off, apart from the Boots Advantage and Marks &amp; Spencer cards, which have decent points systems. With most other schemes, I find it takes forever to accrue anything of value, but I can see why people sign up to them. Catherine Clark, 78, teacher In the past, I used a Nectar card occasionally to buy nappies for my grandchildren. I received a lot of junk mail and useless vouchers, which was annoying. I also didn\u2019t like the idea of my shopping habits being observed, so I cancelled it. I much prefer to shop from independent shops. Charlotte Russell 33, clinical trials manager I have so many \u2013 Waitrose, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, John Lewis, Holland &amp; Barrett, Boots and Superdrug. Some are pretty good, but the rest just weigh down your wallet and result in loads of junk mail. I figured I might as well sign up; you never know when you might need them. I have friends in the US who are savvy with coupons, but it just doesn\u2019t work like that over here with loyalty cards. Rachel Dunn, 28, housing association officer I have a Nectar card and I get some money off my Sainsburys shop but very rarely. At Boots, it took me years to collect \u00a320-worth of points. It takes a long time to benefit from any of these schemes. Hannah Newell, 28, facilities manager I have tonnes of cards, but the only ones I use are Boots and Waitrose. I used to work in Argos, and people would come in with hundreds of pounds-worth of Nectar points to spend \u2013 I have no idea how."

"18||EU referendum: Cameron gives evidence to liaison committee - Politics liveDavid Cameron has given his bluntest assessment yet of the chances of Turkey joining the European Union, saying it will not happen \u201cfor decades\u201d. Giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee, he said: I don\u2019t think the accession of Turkey to the European Union is remotely on the cards. I don\u2019t think it will happen for decades. I think if you look at the facts, the facts are it requires unanimity of all European members. The French, for instance, have said they would have a referendum on it. So I would say very clearly to people, if your vote in this referendum is being influenced by considerations about Turkish membership of the EU, don\u2019t think about it. It is not remotely on the cards. It\u2019s not an issue in this referendum. His comments are in marked contrast to what he said when he gave a speech in Turkey in 2010 and told his audience: \u201cI will remain your strongest possible advocate for EU membership.\u201d (See 5.53pm.) Cameron has been warned to \u201cexpect a writ\u201d if the government refuses to take down its web posts supporting the case for Britain to remain in the European Union. The Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin told him during the hearing it would be illegal to keep pages on the Gov.uk website up during the so-called purdah period in the last few weeks of the campaign. Cameron said the government was taking legal advice, but that calls for websites to be taken down wre an \u201cextreme position\u201d. Jenkin said legal precedent meant the government could not keep up the websites up. He told Cameron: \u201cExpect a letter before action. If we can raise the funds, expect a writ.\u201d The Crown Prosecution Service has said that police forces may go to court to ensure time limits don\u2019t stop possible prosecution of the Tories for breaking election expenses laws. (See 4.56pm.) Alex Salmond, Scotland\u2019s former first minister, has said the election of Boris Johnson as prime minister could be the \u201cmaterial change of circumstances\u201d that would justify another independence referendum. Speaking on LBC he said: I have had a number of conversations with Boris Johnson, and one or two of them have been reasonably lucid. Boris, as he used to say, wanted to if not abolish the Scottish Parliament then to severely restrict its powers, if I remember him correctly. I mean, that might well be a change in material circumstances, who knows? That\u2019s all from me for today. I won\u2019t be blogging during the day tomorrow - a colleague will be here instead - but I will be covering the election results as they come in overnight in an results blog going up tomorrow night. Q: Why do you think the UK should remain in the EU? Cameron says a hard-headed calculation of what is best for the country shows we are better off remaining in. But there is a big argument about Britain too. Being in the EU enhances the UK\u2019s power, he says. Q: And how do you answer Michael Gove\u2019s most powerful point, that slowly our national identity is being eroded. Cameron says he does not feel any less Britain being part of the European Union. There is a big, bold British case to make, he says. Tyrie ends by saying Cameron has been \u201cpretty clear\u201d and that he has given some \u201cdirect answers\u201d. And that is it. The hearing is over. I will post a summary soon. Andrew Tyrie goes next. He says some months ago he proposed to Cameron a plan to reverse the EU ratchet of regulation. Tyrie then published a pamphlet on this. And Cameron became more interested. There are elements of the idea in the EU renegotiation, Tyrie says. But Tyrie says there is a problem; the European Commission will be the one in charge of reviewing regulation. Cameron says, if you want a bureaucracy to deregulate, you have to get the bureaucracy to do it. It is no good getting an outside body to do it, he says. He says this commission is unlike previous ones. It contains strong, pro-business, Atlanticist free traders in it, he says. Meg Hillier goes next. Q: Can you be a bit more precise about what will be done to improve agricultural payments to farmers? Cameron says the government is making progress. The EU\u2019s court of auditors has recognised the UK\u2019s good practice. The Mirror\u2019s Jason Beattie points out that Cameron has changed his tune on Turkey joining the EU over the last six years. The quote is from this speech that Cameron gave in Ankara in 2010, shortly after he became prime minister. Here is a fuller extract. I am here to make the case for Turkey\u2019s membership of the European Union and to fight for it. Do you know who said this? \u2018Here is a country which is not European, its history, its geography, its economy, its agriculture and the character of its people - admirable people though they are - all point in a different direction. This is a country which cannot, despite what it claims and perhaps even what it believes, be a full member.\u2019 Now, that might sound like some Europeans describing Turkey. Actually it was General de Gaulle describing the United Kingdom, my country, before vetoing our accession to the European Union. So we know what it is like to be shut out of the club, but we also know that these things can change. When I think about what Turkey has done to defend Europe as a NATO ally and what Turkey is doing today in Afghanistan alongside our European allies, it makes me angry that your progress towards EU membership can be frustrated in the way that it has been. My view is clear: I believe it is just wrong to say that Turkey can guard the camp but not be allowed to sit in the tent. I will remain your strongest possible advocate for EU membership and for greater influence at the top table of European diplomacy. This is something I feel very strongly and very passionately about. Together I want us to pave the road from Ankara to Brussels. Cameron says he does not think the accession of Turkey is \u201cremotely on the cards\u201d. He says it will not happen \u201cfor decades\u201d. All EU member states would have a veto, he says. Cameron says Turkey will not join the EU \u201cfor decades\u201d. Labour\u2019s Frank Field goes next. Q: Do you think you will be able to stay on as prime minister if the UK votes to leave the EU? Yes, says Cameron. He tells Field to remember he won an election just last year. Labour\u2019s Keith Vaz goes next. Q: There are more than 2,000 EU nations in prisons. Should we have done more to deport them? And, if we leave, will it get easier or harder to get rid of them? Cameron agrees that the government should have done more. But, if we leave the EU, it will get \u201charder\u201d to send prisoners back. Cameron says returning EU prisoners to their home countries will get \u201charder\u201d if the UK votes to leave. Q: Do you wish you had never thought up the referendum, given the damage it is doing to your party? No, says Cameron. He says he believes in democracy. He could have avoided the risk with a referendum on Scotland. But he did not do that. And it\u2019s the same with the EU. Q: Do you think Project Fear tactics work? Cameron says he does not accept that there are exaggerated stories. Q: What about 100,000 jobs lost in the City? Cameron says that is what the head of the stock exchange told him would happen in the event of Brexit. Q: Is Theresa May wrong to say that, if the UK votes to leave the EU, there will be another independence referendum in Scotland? Cameron says we are one United Kingdom, and we take decisions as one United Kingdom. The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart says the Scots did not want a referendum. They did not vote for parties that proposed one. So what is Cameron\u2019s message to Scots if the UK votes to leave? Cameron says the opinion polls show there is very little difference in support from a referendum between Scotland and the rest of the UK. So looking at election results is not a good way of gauging support for a referendum, he says. Q: Len McCluskely, the Unite general secretary, says the government backed down over the trade union bill to get the unions to back the pro-EU campaign. [Jenkin is referring to my colleague Rajeev Syal\u2019s story.] Cameron says the two issues were not related. The government needed to back down because it lost in the Lords. Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative, goes next. He says he has given Cameron notice of this question. Q: The government says it plans to keep its pro-EU websites up during the purdah period (the pre-election period when the government is supposed to be neutral). But I\u2019ve been told this is against the law. Cameron says the government will abide by the law. It will take legal advice too. He says he accepts the need not to update a website during purdah. But he is not convinced that it is necessary to take the website down. Jenkin says his legal advice is that leaving a notice up amounts to publication. If the government does not change its mind, there will be legal action. Cameron jokes about needing to get back to the office then to deal with this. Tory MP Bernard Jenkin says government will be taken to court if it tries to leave pro-EU websites up during the referendum purdah. Back to the committee, and here is a highlight of the last few minutes. The CPS say it is up to the police to decide whether or not they will go to court to apply for the time limit rules to be overturned in relation to alleged election overspending. The CPS has offered to help forces with \u201cinvestigative advice\u201d if that is needed. To recap: under the Representation of the People Act (RPA) 1983 anyone accused of breaking election expenses law can only be prosecuted within a year of the offence being committed, unless an application it made to the courts for an extension, which is allowed under the Act. Several police forces will be involved. The Electoral Commission is investigation serious allegations made by Channel 4 News about possible Tory overspending, relating to three byelections at the end of the last parliament (Newark, Clacton and Rochester and Strood) and contests in 29 constituencies at the general election. The Crown Prosecution Service has put out a statement about today\u2019s meeting with the Electoral Commission. (See 10.32am.) Here it is in full. Following a constructive meeting with the police and Electoral Commission, it has been agreed that each relevant police force will consider what action to take. This may include making an application to the court under s.176 of the Representations of the People Act 1983 to extend the time allowed to bring a prosecution. This is significant. Here\u2019s what it means. Police forces may go to court to ensure time limits don\u2019t stop possible prosecution of the Tories for breaking election expenses laws, the CPS says. Labour\u2019s Meg Hillier goes next. Q: The incompetence of your government is putting the pro-Europe case at risk. Payments for farmers have not been processed properly. Cameron says he accepts that the government needs to manage these payments more effectively. Cameron says Sir Bill Cash always wanted the UK to have some sort of associate membership of the EU. But that option was not available, he says. He says Cash argued in the 1990s that the UK opt-out on the single currency would not work. But it has worked. And the Danish opt-out worked for them. Cameron is now being questioned by Bill Cash. Cameron says he does not want to \u201cover-emphasis the achievement of his [EU] renegotiation\u201d. Cameron says he does not want to \u201cover-emphasis the achievement of his [EU] renegotiation\u201d. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, goes first. Q: Were you serious when you suggested that you might recommend leaving the EU if you did not get your way in the renegotiation? Cameron says he has never advocated leaving the EU. Q: But if you had not got a renegotiation, would you be now advocating leaving? Cameron says that is a hypothetical question. He never wanted the British people to have to answer that question. Q: I\u2019m trying to find out if you are recommending that Britain stays on the basis of the renegotiation. Cameron says some people would want to leave whatever happened. He wants to stay in the EU on the basis of what he has renegotiated. Q: If the choice was staying in the EU as it is now, what would you recommend? Cameron says he is advising people to stay in the EU on the basis of what he has renegotiated. He says it is \u201can additional reasons to stay\u201d. It has addressed concerns people had real worries about. David Cameron is about to give evidence to the Commons liaison committee (the one made up of the chairs of all Common select committees) about the EU referendum. Tim Farron, the leader of the Lib Dems, has also welcomed the government\u2019s child refugee U-turn. But he says the government will have to take at least 1,000 children to make it meaningful. In a statement he said: Since I first raised the issue with him last October, the prime minister has done everything he can to ignore the plight of unaccompanied child refugees in Europe, so I strongly welcome the announcement that we will finally be helping these vulnerable kids. 90,000 unaccompanied children arrived in Europe last year, so 3,000 is the very least Britain can do. I will do everything I can to ensure that the government meets this target. What started as a call supported only by the Lib Dems has developed into a truly cross party campaign, and those activists up and down the country who have championed this should be proud of their efforts today. The detail remains to be seen. Tens or hundreds simply won\u2019t be good enough and would be a betrayal of the British public and parliament. This is a victory, but it\u2019s not the end of the story. The government must also ensure that local authorities are properly funded so that they can help these traumatised children rebuild their lives and achieve their full potential. UPDATE: In his statement Farron says fewer than 1,000 refugees \u201cwon\u2019t be good enough\u201d but a Lib Dem spokesman says the party actually wants the government to take 3,000. Many of you are interested in the meeting between the Electoral Commission and the Crown Prosecution Service about extending legal time-limits to allow a possible prosecution in relation to the allegations about the Tories breaking rules on election spending. (See 10.32am.) The meeting took place earlier. The commission aren\u2019t saying anything about it, but the CPS say they are due to issue a statement later this afternoon. I\u2019ll post it when I get it. If you are voting tomorrow and you need information before you decide who to back, do take a look at Democratic Dashboard. It is an online tool set up by Democratic Audit at the LSE that is intended to provide all the relevant information about candidates and past election results that you need. Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour\u2019s refugee task force, has described the government child refugee U-turn (see 2.13pm) as \u201ca major change\u201d. In a statement she said: Now we have seen more detail on the government\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s clear this is a major change in principle in the space of a week and that is huge tribute to everyone who has campaigned so hard on this. I strongly welcome this major change in principle. Now we need to make sure it turns into practice and that enough places are provided. For the first time, the government has accepted that Britain should do its bit and help child refugees who are at risk within Europe - having refused even a week ago to countenance this. And they are accepting the Dubs amendment that the Prime Minister rejected last week. This has only happened because of the huge strength of feeling that Britain should help children sleeping rough, at risk of harm and prostitution, meaning ministers realised they would have lost the vote. It shows that cross party campaigning can make a real difference. However the government hasn\u2019t said how many children will be helped and hasn\u2019t said whether this will be close to the 3000 places we originally called for. So we will keep up the campaign to make sure it delivers in practice. Sadiq Khan, Labour\u2019s candidate for London mayor, has told London Live TV that he will use his second preference vote in the mayoral contest to vote for the Women\u2019s Equality party. He said: I\u2019m a big fan of the Women\u2019s Equality party. I say this in a non-patronising way, I\u2019ve got two daughters and what\u2019s unacceptable in 2016 is your gender can define the job you can get, it can define how safe you are and can define the pay you get. It will be a completely redundant vote - assuming his first vote is for himself, Khan\u2019s second preference won\u2019t come into play - but it is nevertheless a notable quasi-endorsement. Nigel Farage is campaigning in Lincolshshire today. Apart from a few seats on Lincoln city council the only other election being held in the county is for the police and crome commissioner. There are serious fears that the turnout will be so low that Ukip could have their first PCC with control over the police force. Their candidate is a Victoria Ayling whose views on sending home all immigrants were too much even for the Daily Mail. Save the Children has warmly welcomed the government\u2019s announcement about child refugees. In a statement Tanya Steele, its chief executive, said: The UK government has today matched the great leadership they have shown in providing aid and support to Syrian refugees in the region by reaching out a hand to children already on European shores. This announcement echoes Britain\u2019s proud history of offering safety at times of great crisis and we want to thank the members of parliament who have led the way in championing this cause, as well as the British public who have opened their hearts to refugee children. David Cameron has said his government will not stand in the way of an amendment by a Labour peer that paves the way for the UK to provide homes to unaccompanied refugee children who have already arrived in Europe. Cameron made the comment at PMQs, and Number 10 has susbsequently confirmed in a statement that the UK will take an unspecified number of child refugees who registered in Greece, Italy or France before 20 March. (See 2.13pm.) David Cameron has described Labour as a party that puts \u201cextremists over working people\u201d during PMQs exchanges which saw him repeatedly criticise Jeremy Corbyn for once describing Hamas and Hezbollah as \u201cfriends\u201d. Cameron quoted what Corbyn said as a backbench MP, when he said he had invited \u201cour friends\u201d from Hamas and Hezbollah to speak at an event. Cameron went on: [Corbyn] referred to Hamas and Hezbollah as his friends. He needs to withdraw that remark ... Are they your friends or are they not? Because these organisations in their constitutions believe in persecuting and killing Jews. They are anti-Semitic organisations, they are racist organisations. He must stand up and say they are not his friends. Corbyn did not explicitly retract the comment, but he told Cameron: Obviously, anyone who commits racist acts or is anti-Semitic is not a friend of mine. I am very clear about that ... I absolutely do not approve of those organisations. Cameron has said the Iraq inquiry report will come out \u201cnot too much longer\u201d after the EU referendum on 23 June. It has always been expected to come out around then, but the government has until now never explicitly ruled out it being published before the referendum. Downing Street has said Cameron has \u201cno intention\u201d of withdrawing his condemnation of comments by US presidential hopeful Donald Trump as \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong\u201d. As the Press Association reports, an adviser to Trump has said Cameron apologise to Trump, after the withdrawal of main rival Ted Cruz made him all but certain of securing the Republican nomination. Cameron criticised Trump last December, saying Trump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslims entering the US was \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong\u201d. George Papadopoulos, an adviser to Trump, said Cameron\u2019s comments were \u201cuncalled-for\u201d and it would be \u201cwise\u201d for the prime minister to \u201creach out in a more positive manner\u201d to the Republican front-runner. Asked about Papadopoulos\u2019s comments, Cameron\u2019s official spokeswoman said: The prime minister has no intention of withdrawing his comments, which were made in response to comments that Donald Trump made calling for a ban on Muslims entering the US. That was the context for the PM\u2019s comments. Britain\u2019s chief rabbi has claimed that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour has a severe problem with antisemitism and warned that the party must not resort to political posturing and empty promises. Two more Labour councillors have been suspended over allegations of anti-Semitism, the party has said. Miqdad Al-Nuaimi, a councillor in Newport, south Wales, and Terry Kelly, who sits on Renfrewshire Council, have been suspended \u201cpending an investigation\u201d, a spokesman said. Cameron has declined to appear before a parliamentary committee to give evidence to its inquiry into Libya, citing diary pressures. He told the foreign affairs committee that Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has already given evidence to it on behalf of the government. Amnesty International has accused the first minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, of delaying justice by blocking funds for a series of inquests into Troubles-related killings. Cameron has revealed, in an interview with First News, the children\u2019s newspaper, that he bans his children from playing with electronic devices on Saturday mornings. After the interview Alex Garcia-Ghuran, from Hertfordshire, said: We learned from Mr Cameron that his children do not get to play with any electronic devices on Saturday morning and he will get upset if he catches them breaking the rule. That sounded like my dad. There was some confusion after PMQs about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s statement on Tuesday that: \u201cWe are not going to lose seats, we are looking to gain seats where we can.\u201d Asked whether he really meant this, an aide to the leader said Corbyn may have been \u201cslightly misinterpreted\u201d, adding that \u201cwhat he said was that he said he would make no predictions about the number of seats to be won or lost.\u201d That assertion was challenged by the Daily Mirror\u2019s political editor, who pointed out that Corbyn had clearly said Labour was \u201cnot going to lose seats\u201d. Corbyn\u2019s aide clarified that the leader said in his previous sentence and elsewhere on many occasions that he was not going to make predictions about gains and losses. Asked whether Corbyn had misspoken, the spokesman said: \u201cI\u2019m telling you what he intended to say. He was saying we are not in the business of losing seats.\u201d Downing Street has just issued new details of the child refugee climbdown. Child refugees who registered in Greece, Italy or France before 20 March (when the EU/Turkey migration agreement came into force) will be eligible for resettlement in the UK, it says. Here is an extract from the news release. Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children will be resettled from Greece, Italy and France, in an initiative announced today following discussions between the government and Save the Children. This initiative builds on last month\u2019s announcement that up to 3,000 vulnerable children and family members will be resettled direct from the Middle East and North Africa. And it adds to the resettlement of 20,000 people direct from Syrian refugee communities, which has been under way since last year. The government has always adopted a twin-track approach to dealing with the migrant crisis: helping the most vulnerable while not encouraging new perilous crossings to Europe. That approach will continue through this initiative, by restricting resettlement to children registered before the EU migration agreement with Turkey came into force on 20 March. The retrospective nature of the scheme will avoid creating a perverse incentive for families to entrust their children to people traffickers. And it will mean that the UK can focus on the most vulnerable children already in Europe without encouraging more to make the journey. The government says it is not putting a figure on the number of children who will be accepted, but that it \u201cwill instead work with local authorities across the UK to determine how many children will be resettled\u201d. The first arrivals are due before the end of the year, it says. After PMQs a spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn said Corbyn\u2019s use of the term \u201cfriends\u201d to refer to Hamas and Hezbollah was about \u201ca diplomatic term of address in a meeting about peace and reconciliation\u201d. The spokesman went on: He has been involved in peace and reconciliation processes all over the world, including Latin America, the Middle East, Ireland and elsewhere and he will continue to pursue dialogue in areas of conflict, as he always has done. He has been involved in various peace and reconciliation initiatives in which all the parties to the conflict have been met Jeremy has said repeatedly that anti-Semitism in any form in society and in the Labour Party is completely unacceptable and repugnant and will be acted upon, and he has acted on it. In the time that he\u2019s been leader, 18 people have been suspended in relation to anti-Semitic allegations or incidents, and every single one of those has taken place within 48 hours. I should say that getting on for half of those relate to incidents or online posts before Jeremy Corbyn was leader. He has taken more action, more quickly, than any other Labour leader or any leader of any other party. And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs on Twitter. Generally the view seems to be that it was a win for Cameron, but a messy and unpleasant one. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Jason Beattie From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire From the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton From the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope From Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton From the Sunday Times\u2019s James Lyons From the Birmingham Post\u2019s Jonathan Walker From the Sun\u2019s Craig Woodhouse From the Yorkshire Post\u2019s Kate Proctor From the Specator\u2019s Isabel Hardman From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith From PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield PMQs verdict: There is a time and place for a sensible discussion about whether or not Jeremy Corbyn is unduly sympathetic towards certain terrorists organisations, like Hamas and the IRA. It is a debate that can encompass the evils of colonialism, the willingness of governments to conduct secret negotiations with terrorist groups, Corbyn\u2019s own personal aversion to violence, quite what he meant when he spoke about his \u201cfriends\u201d from Hamas (he has said he uses the phrase about all groups invited to meetings he chairs, although it is hard to imagine him using it in association with, say, Ukip) and his refusal repeatedly to condemn the IRA in an interview last summer. But PMQs is not the time and place for a sensible discussion about anything. It is a coarse and rather brutal arena in which, as Cameron once said, you are either the lion, or the Christian who gets eaten. It\u2019s a contest to assert political authority (which, by the way, is why the complaints about it being Cameron\u2019s job to answer questions, not ask them, are beside the point). And today, by challenging Corbyn repeatedly on extremism, Cameron easily came out on top. It wasn\u2019t particularly pleasant to watch, but human sacrifice in the amphitheatre never was. To his credit, Corbyn did not fold. He made an effective point about the Tory hypocrisy over Suliman Gani, and he came close to retracting the comment about his \u201cfriends\u201d from Hamas when he said that anyone who did anything racist could not be a friend of his. But that was not enough to stop Cameron demanding a full retraction. Could have have done anything different? A full apology and withdrawal might have done the trick, but that would have involved Corbyn turning his back, or at least partially turning his back, on things he has said and believed for his entire political career, and that is not something he is able to do. I normally miss Angus Robertson\u2019s questions in the PMQs minute-by-minute, but I know from reading comments BTL that this annoys readers so a colleague has been helping out. Here are extracts from the exchanges. This is where David Cameron announced the U-turn over child refugees and the Dubs amendment. Angus Robertson: Last week the prime minister took issue when I raised the issue of unaccompanied syrian refugee children in Europe and the Kindertransports of the 1930s ... Why has it taken so long and a threat of a parly defeat for the PM to begin changing his mind? David Cameron: Let\u2019s be clear that no country has done more than Britain to help when it comes to syrian refugees. No country has raised more money, and only the United States has spent more money. But I do want us to proceed with as much support across the house as we can. I think it\u2019s right to stick to the principal that we shouldn\u2019t be encouraging people to make this dangerous journey. I think its right to stick to the idea we keep investing in the refugee camps and in neighbouring countries and I also think its right not to take part in the EU resettlement schemes. Robertson came back, and in his second answer Cameron said the government would accept the Dubs amendment. He said: I do reject the comparison with the Kindertransport, I would argue that what we\u2019re doing primarily which is taking children from the region, vulnerable people from the camps, going to the neighbouring countries and taking people in to our country. That to me is like the Kindertransport. To say the Kindertransport is taking today children from France, Germany or Italy - safe countries that are democracies - I think that is an insult to those countries. It won\u2019t be necessary to send the Dubs amendment back to the other place. We\u2019re going to go round the local authorities and see what more we can do but let\u2019s stick to the principle we should not be taking new arrivals to Europe. Labour\u2019s Keith Vaz, a Leicester MP who is wearing a Leicester City scarf, says Gary Lineker said he would present Match of the Day in his underway if Leicester won the championship, he thought it was so unlikely. Does Cameron agree that if you make a promise, you should keep it. Cameron says he does agree. He notes from what Lineker says that he has not yet given a definite answer. Greg Mulholland, a Lib Dem, asks about a war widow who lost her pension when she remarried. Cameron says the government changed the rules so that this does not happen in future. But, like previous governments, it has taken the view that the rules should not be changed retrospectively. John Baron, a Conservative, says the Tories must be a one nation party. Does Cameron agree if we leave the EU wages will rise. Cameron says that if we leave the EU the economic consequences will be negative. That is what the experts say, he says. Labour\u2019s Graham Allen asks Cameron to help get a \u201cwhat works\u201d centre looking at tackling sexual abuse up and running. Cameron says the Home Office is setting up a centre on preventing sexual abuse and exploitation. David Cameron has said his government will not stand in the way of an amendment by Lord Dubs paving the way for the UK to take unaccompanied refugee children who have already arrived in Europe. The prime minister gave credit to the Labour peer, who was a refugee himself as part of the kindertransport, and said that he would accept it now that it no longer included the figure of 3,000 children. \u201cIt won\u2019t be necessary to send the Dubs amendment back, it doesn\u2019t mention a number of people. We are going to speak to local authorities to see what we can do,\u201d the prime minister told MPs. However, he said he wanted to stick to the principle that Britain would not take in new children who were arriving in Europe because he believed that it could act as a pull factor, and argued that other European countries ought to be safe places. The SNP\u2019s Margaret Ferrier asks what protections the goverment is seeking for the NHS in TTIP. Cameron says this is \u201cthe reddest of red herrings\u201d. The NHS is totally protected, he says. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock asks what is being done to ensure that Tata is a responsible seller. Cameron says the timetable for a sale is short. The government is working with Tata to help the sale go through. David Amess, a Conservative, asks about the Chilcott report. Cameron says he expects the Chilcott report to come \u201cnot long after\u201d the EU referendum on 23 June. The SNP\u2019s Patrick Grady asks Cameron to review guidance saying it is acceptable to send asylum seekers back to Eritrea. He says it has been described as the North Korea of Africa. Cameron says he will look at this. Martin Vickers, a Conservative, asks about a road in his constituency where new safety work is required. Cameron says he will look at this. The Green MP Caroline Lucas asks Cameron to define a \u201cmodal verb\u201d. Cameron says the whole point of these tests is to ensure that the next generation is better educated than we are. Snap PMQs verdict: A wretched 17 minutes for Corbyn. This is not the first time Cameron has attacked Corbyn\u2019s alleged extremist sympathies at PMQs, but today the onslaught was particularly timely and pertinent. Corbyn made a reasonable fist of trying to defend himself, dissociating himself from the \u201cfriends\u201d remark about Hamas (although not retracting it as bluntly as Cameron proposed) and pointing out, quite rightly, the hypocrisy of the Tory attacks on Suliman Gani. And the Cameron broadside was not especially fair, because there is probably no one in parliament who believes that Corbyn actually approves of Hamas rocket attacks on Israelis. But Corbyn has been more sympathetic to groups like Hamas than MPs in the political mainstream, meaning that Cameron\u2019s comments had enough justification to give them potency. Today Cameron exploited that to the full, with brutal effect. Corbyn says Ghani is a Conservative. And he quotes a former Tory candidate saying she was ashamed of the \u201crepulsive campaign of hate\u201d in Goldsmith\u2019s campaign and would be voting Labour. Corbyn turns to inequality, and says the government is taking away the measures that can tackle it. Cameron says inequality is going down under this government. He says the government is investing in schools and homes. He may be a friend of the terrorist group Hamas. But he is a friend of aspiration. Corbyn says politics is about choices. Cameron\u2019s govenrment has cut income tax for the richest, and cut corporation tax again and again. Tomorrow people can make their choices. The Tories want to cut taxes for the rich. Labour want decent services for everyone, he says. Cameron says Corbyn is right. Politics is about choices. People can back a party that puts extremists over working people and is incapable of providing leadership. Cameron says Corbyn needs to stand up and say Hamas and Hezbollah are not his friends. Corbyn says anyone who commits racist acts is not a friend of his. He says Cameron should reflect on the way Zac Goldsmith has smeared Sadiq Khan in London. He says a Joseph Rowntree report found 1.5m are unable to afford the thing they need. Cameron says the stronger economy means more people are in work. He rejects what Corbyn said about Khan. We are not responsible for what people say who we share a platform with. But there is a pattern of behaviour here. Khan shared a platform with someone who trained the 7/7 attacks. And he shared a platform with someone who called for Jews to be drowned. And he then said they were just flowery words. He challenges Corbyn again to withdraw what he said about Hamas/ Corbyn says Suliman Gani, the imam that Cameron attacked Khan for sharing a platform with is a Conservative supporter. And he says Andrew Lansley said some time ago racism was endemic in the Conservative party. Cameron should set up an inquiry too. He asks Cameron to follow the example of the Welsh Labour government in placing a responsibility to help people in a housing crisis. Cameron says the government has built twice as much council housing as Labour. He quotes some of the views of Gani. Jeremy Corbyn welcomes Cameron\u2019s comment about Leicester, and asks if this means he will be supporting another team, in addition to the two he supports already. He says preparations for anti-Holocaust day are starting in Israel. We all have a duty to oppose antisemitism, he says. He asks about council cuts. Cameron used to say we were all in it together. What happened to that. Cameron welcomes what Corbyn said about anti-Holocaust day, but he quotes Corbyn saying in the past it would be a pleasure to host his \u201cfriends\u201d from Hamas in parliament. Corbyn says he has made it clear Labour is an anti-racist party. It has established an inquiry into antisemitism. He says Cameron is referring to a meeting he hosted to try to help the peace process. His remarks do not amount to an approval of those organisation. If social care is a priority, why has \u00a34.5bn been cut from the adult social care budget, leaving 300,000 without the care the need. Karl McCartney, a Conservative, asks Cameron to condemn the actions of Hezbollah and Hamas. Cameron say the point about Hamas is important. They are a terrorist group who believe in killing Jews. He says Corbyn needs to withdraw the remark about Hamas being friends. The SNP\u2019s Martyn Day asks Cameron to stop air strikes in Syria, which had done nothing to bring about peace. Cameron says we should continue to hit Daesh terrorists, but also do everything to support dialogue between the opposition and the Syrian regime. David Cameron starts by congratulating Leicester on winning the Premier League. They have shown superb ability and a great team ethic, he says. PMQs is about to start. Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, has admitted the furore over anti-semitism within Labour after Ken Livingstone\u2019s remarks last week has damaging the party chances in tomorrow\u2019s Scottish parliament election. With Scottish Labour now neck and neck with the Tories in Holyrood polling, Dugdale told the Guardian that voters were raising the controversy in the final days of the campaign. \u201cIt has unquestionably had an effect,\u201d she said. Insisting she was going to \u201ckeep smiling\u201d, Dugdale added: I\u2019m not going to go into the business of analysing what has happened over the past few days but it is coming up on the doorsteps. I\u2019m going to carry on doing what I have always done in this campaign which is make a positive case for how we can use the powers of the Scottish parliament to make different choices from the Tories in Scotland. Sadiq Khan, Labour\u2019s candidate for London mayor, was interviewed on LBC earlier. Here are the main points. Khan apologised for using the phrase \u201cUncle Toms\u201d seven years ago. As today\u2019s Sun reports, he used the phrase in 2009, when he was a communities minister. Khan told LBC that he was using it in a self-deprecatory way, to explain the need to reach out to the wider minority ethnic community. But he accepted that using the phrase was wrong. He said: I regret using the phrase. I do regret using the phrase and I\u2019m sorry. He said Zac Goldsmith\u2019s campaign had been \u201cdivisive\u201d and worse than any mainstream campaign he had seen in his lifetime. Some of the tactics used are not the sort of tactics that I\u2019ve seen in mainstream politics in my lifetime. Khan said he was worried that Goldsmith\u2019s campaign would deter Asians and Muslims from going into public life. He said: During the last few weeks in particular I\u2019ve met more and more and more Londoners, Asian origin, some of them Islamic faith, who are saying, \u2018You know what, we\u2019ve done really well in business, or accountancy, or medicine, we were thinking about our children, encouraging them to go into politics, to get involved in public life, but you know what, no, after what\u2019s happened to you, we are not going to do that\u2019. What I\u2019m saying to them is, no, you must do it. I\u2019ve never talked about some of the racism I suffered when I was a young lawyer, or as a young politician. I\u2019ve always talked about how easy it is. \u2018If I can do it, you can do it, it\u2019s so easy, just listen to your teachers, you can do it, join a mainstream party.\u2019 I\u2019m the man that celebrated when Adam Afriyie was elected in Windsor. I think that it\u2019s great that there are parties competing for minority votes. I think Sajid [Javid] in the cabinet and Priti [Patel] is fantastic for our way of life. We\u2019re not all the same, Asian people. We\u2019ve got different views ... So I\u2019ve been disappointed. I don\u2019t like talking about it because I don\u2019t want people to think, \u2018If that\u2019s what Sadiq\u2019s family went through, why should we want to be a councillor?\u2019 He denied a claim that he does not want Jeremy Corbyn to attend his victory party if he wins in London. He criticised Boris Johnson for giving the impression that \u201cmayors can\u2019t do much\u201d. Johnson implied that the job of a mayor was just to walk on red carpets and crack a few jokes, he said. Actually, mayors can do a huge amount. I\u2019ve met with and studied mayors from around the world. A mayor can use the levers given to him or her by parliament, the powers, but also to use the pulpit of City Hall to persuade people to do stuff for the betterment of London. The Home Office minister James Brokenshire will answer the urgent question, Laura Kuenssberg reports. It seems it won\u2019t cover child refugees. ITV says David Cameron is expected to announce a climbdown on unaccompanied child refugees at PMQs. Piers Corbyn, Jeremy\u2019s brother, has defended Ken Livingstone in relation to the row about Hitler and Zionism. Jeremy suspended Livingstone from the Labour party for the comments, but Piers has told the Evening Standard that Livingstone was \u201cmisunderstood\u201d. He told the paper: I think Ken has been misunderstood, because he has been talking actual history which now looks incomprehensible. We can\u2019t understand now the context those things happened in, but there is numbers of historical documents around which seem to bear out some things that Ken has said. But they\u2019ve been taken out of context ... The relationship between Nazis and the Jews, and Russia, have been complicated and there have been serious alliances, or mutual supports, or dealings which are difficult to understand now. There is an urgent question on the proposed changes to EU asylum rules in the Commons at 12.30pm. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg is wondering whether this will be when we get the child migrants climbdown. Responding to government suggestions that it is going to offer a compromise over unaccompanied child refugees (see 10.07am), Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce, said the government needed to do a \u201cproper U-turn\u201d on this. Fear of losing Monday\u2019s vote on the Dubs amendment has led to the government briefings that they are looking at this again. Now we need real action. We were promised a few weeks ago that the government would make concessions, but in the end they only re-announced the same help for refugees outside Europe. That won\u2019t be good enough his time. We need to see real action to help child refugees who are at risk of abuse, exploitation and trafficking within Europe. So far ministers have only ever announced increased support when under serious political pressure - we will keep this up until next week\u2019s vote. Across the country there is strong support for Britain to do its bit to give sanctuary to vulnerable children just as we did with the Kindertransport decades ago. And Kindertransport survivors have been the strongest voices calling on us to help once more. Now we need real action and a proper u-turn from the prime minister, not just warm words. LBC and ITV have released a London mayoral poll this morning showing Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan extending his lead over his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith. Here is an extract from the news release. In the race for City Hall, Khan now leads Goldsmith 56% compared to 44%, when the second preferences of those voting for another candidate are taken into account. This represents an increase of two points from the previous ComRes poll for LBC and ITV News London conducted in April, suggesting that the Labour candidate is moving ahead with just one day to go before the mayoral elections. One in five Londoners (19%) say that Zac Goldsmith\u2019s campaign has been \u2018dirty\u2019, opposed to 8% for Khan, and a third of those questioned (32%) describe Khan\u2019s campaign as \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018inspiring\u2019 (16%), compared to 23% and 9% respectively for Goldsmith. However, while 45% say that Khan is \u2018passionate\u2019, 20% of Londoners think that he is \u2018extreme\u2019. In comparison, 32% think that Goldsmith is \u2018passionate\u2019 and 13% say that he is \u2018extreme\u2019. The poll also suggests that, if Boris Johnson were the Conservative candidate, he would beat Khan by by 41% to 39%. The Electoral Commission has got a meeting today with the police and the Crown Prosecution Service at which it will try to persuade them to apply for a court order to extend the time limit for a possible prosecution in relation to claims the Tories overspent in some constituencies during the general election. This is from the Press Association. Tories face claims that accommodation costs of activists bussed into key constituencies around the country should have been recorded under individual candidates\u2019 limits, rather than as part of the national campaign. The Electoral Commission believes its ongoing probe into alleged breaches of reporting obligations will take at least another month - taking it past the one-year time limit for launching criminal proceedings. It is meeting with police forces covering the constituencies involved and the Crown Prosecution Service to ask them to seek an extension to ensure the door is not closed. Claims about the Conservatives\u2019 general election spending - as well as that at three parliamentary by-elections - were first raised by Channel 4 News. The party blames an \u201cadministrative error\u201d for failing to register some accommodation costs. But David Cameron insists it was right to include such expenditure as part of the national campaign rather than against the limits imposed on individual candidates. Bob Posner, director of party and election finance and legal counsel at the Electoral Commission said: \u201cThe police and the CPS both have the power to apply to the courts to extend the time limit on bringing criminal prosecutions for electoral offences to allow for full investigations to take place. We have requested that they consider doing this.\u201d The commission said it did not take any view as to whether the party should be pursued under the Representation of the People Act (RPA) 1983, which regulates candidate spending. There is more detail here, in a statement from the Electoral Commission last week. The commission said the meeting was taking place this morning, but it would not give any more details, or so who would be attending. And it is not clear yet whether the CPS will announce today whether or not it intends to comply with the commission\u2019s request and seek a court order to extend the time limit for prosecutions. Yesterday it emerged that the government is considering further concessions on Britain accepting unaccompanied child refugees from Europe ahead of a vote next week which could see up to 30 Tory MPs rebelling and voting in favour of a Labour pro-refugee amendment to the immigration bill. This morning the Conservative MP Heidi Allen, who abstained in the first vote on this (she explained why she did not vote against the government on her blog) told the Today programme that she was \u201c100%\u201d determined to rebel in next week\u2019s vote and that \u201cmany\u201d Tory MPs felt the same way. But George Osborne, the chancellor, told the BBC this morning that discussions were still going on and that an announcement about new measures (intended to avert the revolt) would be made in due course. Britain has always been a home to the vulnerable and we\u2019ve always done what we need to do to help people who are fleeing persecution. That\u2019s why we are taking people from the refugee camps as a result of this terrible Syrian civil war and we\u2019re working with others, with charities, with other political parties, talking to people about what we can do to help the unaccompanied children as well, where we\u2019re already providing financial support. So we are in those discussions and those discussions will go on and you will hear what we\u2019ve got to say in due course. On the Today programme the Labour MP Louise Ellman, who is Jewish, welcomed the chief rabbi\u2019s article, saying he was \u201cquite right\u201d. She went on: This is a very serious problem. I think we need a great deal more education about what antisemitism is. Criticising the government of the state of Israel is absolutely legitimate. But when the world\u2019s only Jewish state is demonised, treated in a way no other state is, when people talk about conspiracy theories, they talk about Jewish power and Jewish control, indeed applying to Zionism exactly the same untruths that are applied to Jews in straightforward antisemitism, we are moving into antisemitic territory. And that has to be understood. I don\u2019t think it is understood at the moment. Just as the row about antisemitism in the Labour party was starting to die down, the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, has propelled it back on to the front pages with a forceful article in the Daily Telegraph. It is the first time he has commented since the Labour MP Naz Shah was suspended last week, prompting Ken Livingstone to try defending her with his bizarre ramblings about Hitler. There are three key points in the article. Mirvis suggests he is worried that the inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party could just amount to \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d. He said he welcomed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to announce the inquiry, but he said he was worried about people saying the allegations about antisemitism in the party were not genuine, but were just a \u201csmear\u201d. In recent days, we have heard anti-Semitism in the Labour Party described variously as \u201ca smear\u201d and as \u201cmood music\u201d being manipulated by political opponents of Jeremy Corbyn. There has been nothing more disheartening in this story than the suggestion that this is more about politics than about substance. The worst of mistakes, in trying to address this problem, would be to treat it as a political attack which requires a political solution. If this inquiry turns out to be no more than a sticking plaster, designed to placate and diffuse until after the elections this week, the problem will surely get worse and not better. Jeremy Corbyn has stated that his party \u201cwill not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form,\u201d and I very much hope that this inquiry will deliver on that pledge and be followed by decisive action. All political parties share in the responsibility to rid our society of anti-Semitism but we cannot achieve that objective with political posturing or empty promises of action never to be fulfilled. One person making the \u201csmear\u201d claim has been Corbyn\u2019s close ally Diane Abbott. She told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: \u201cIt\u2019s a smear to say that Labour has a problem with antisemitism. It is something like a smear against ordinary party members.\u201d Mirvis argues that attacking Zionism amounts to antisemitism. Zionism is a belief in the right to Jewish self-determination in a land that has been at the centre of the Jewish world for more than 3,000 years. One can no more separate it from Judaism than separate the City of London from Great Britain. Open a Jewish daily prayer book used in any part of the world and Zionism will leap out at you. The innumerable references to the land of Israel are inescapable and demonstrative ... Zionism is a movement celebrated by people right across the political spectrum, all over the world, and requires no endorsement or otherwise of the particular policies of any Israeli Government at any time. But to those people who have nevertheless sought to redefine Zionism, who vilify and delegitimize it, I say: Be under no illusions \u2013 you are deeply insulting not only the Jewish community but countless others who instinctively reject the politics of distortion and demonisation. And, in particular, he effectively accuses Livingstone of spreading antisemitism. To those who so eagerly reach for a vicious Holocaust reference in order to exact the maximum amount of pain and offence upon \u201cZionists\u201d, I say: You are spreading that ancient and insidious virus of anti-Semitism. I will be posting reaction to the Mirvis article as it comes in. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Sadiq Khan, Labour\u2019s candidate for London mayor, is interviewed on LBC. 12pm: David Cameron faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 4.30pm: Cameron gives evidence to the Commons liaison committee about the EU referendum. I will be focusing in particular on PMQs and Cameron\u2019s appearance at the liaison committee but, as usual, I will also be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary after PMQs and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. If you think there are any voices that I\u2019m leaving out, particularly political figures or organisations giving alternative views of the stories I\u2019m covering, do please flag them up below the line (include \u201cAndrew\u201d in the post). I can\u2019t promise to include everything, but I do try to be open to as wide a range of perspectives as possible."
"19||Police dig at home of child abusers who were Fred West's friendsExcavation work by police is expected to continue until the weekend at the home of a couple who were friends of serial killers Fred and Rose West and were themselves jailed for child sex offences. Specially trained officers are digging at the bungalow of Pauline and David Williams in the picturesque Devon village of Bradninch. The force refused to comment on rumours that they had been tipped off that a child\u2019s body may have been concealed at the property. David and Pauline Williams were jailed at Exeter crown court in November for a string of sexual offences dating back to the 1980s. David was jailed for life, his wife for 12 years. Their catalogue of abuse started in Gloucester, where they met the Wests, and continued when they moved to Devon in the 1990s. Exeter crown court heard they subjected six girls and four boys to rapes, sexual assaults and beatings when their victims were as young as seven. In some cases the abuse continued until they were teenagers. The jury had heard that David Williams terrified some of his victims by boasting of his connections with the Wests, who used to drink at the Prince Albert pub in Gloucester, which the Williamses ran. Fred West killed himself before being put on trial for a string of sexually motivated murders. His wife, Rose, is serving life after being convicted of 10 murders. A Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said: \u201cWe are not in a position to comment on what is being searched for other than to say it is based on historic [sic] information. This is the only property being looked at in relation to this investigation.\u201d In a statement outside the property Keith Perkin, head of the public protection unit for the force, confirmed on Thursday the search was expected to continue for a further two days. He said: \u201cOfficers are here today carrying out excavations to a house in Bradninch near Cullompton in Devon. \u201cThis follows certain information of an historic nature that we have received in connection to this property and its former occupants. I expect that this work, carried out by specially trained search officers will take a further two days. \u201cI am aware that given the media attention around a small village this will impact on the local community and I can reassure them that there will be local neighbourhood officers out today and tomorrow to give them that reassurance.\u201d Police officers, some with pickaxes, were seen coming and going from the property throughout the day and digging could be heard. One local person said: \u201cThe garden is not visible from the road but you can clearly hear what is going on. The whole village seems to be in shock.\u201d Other former neighbours of the couple claimed they would try to get young children to come and play in their garden \u2013 and regularly offered them sweets. One mother said: \u201cIt is just horrific. They used to encourage children to come and play in their garden. I always thought they were creepy so never had anything to do with them.\u201d The council property has remained empty since the pair were jailed. The investigation into the couple, named Operation Abbey, began in July 2013 when a woman disclosed to a mental health professional that she had been raped and sexually abused by David Williams when she was 15. A number of other people then came forward. The police are believed to have been at their bungalow since Tuesday. Another neighbour said: \u201cThey obviously moved here as a hideaway because it is a villagey place where nobody would know them.\u201d"
"10||'May the Fourth' be with you: a look at Rian Johnson's Star Wars: Episode VIIIGreat solar storms of uncertainty swirl around Star Wars: Episode VIII, written and directed by Rian Johnson. Will the upcoming sequel to JJ Abrams\u2019 The Force Awakens continue to plough the hyper-nostalgic furrow that helped make its predecessor the highest-grossing movie of all time at the domestic box office, or risk shifting the space opera saga into uncharted territory? Will Johnson begin to unravel the mysteries surrounding key figures such as Daisy Ridley\u2019s Rey, Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Maz Kanata and Mark Hamill\u2019s Luke Skywalker? And what will happen to Chewbacca\u2019s furry fuzzball hide now that Han Solo\u2019s not around to help him out with a frequent trim? To answer all these questions, and in celebration of May the Fourth, here\u2019s everything we\u2019ve been able to glean so far about Star Wars: Episode VIII. The creative team Johnson is the brains behind time travel-themed futuristic action thinkpiece Looper, noir-edge high school mystery Brick and several of the best episodes (Fly, Fifty-One and Ozymandias) of cult crime epic Breaking Bad. Unlike Abrams, who worked with Star Wars screenwriting legend Lawrence Kasdan on The Force Awakens, he\u2019ll be both writing and directing the space saga\u2019s next instalment. Rumour has it that the 43-year-old has been given free rein to take Star Wars in whichever direction he chooses \u2013 though we can\u2019t quite imagine he\u2019d be given carte blanche to make Episode VIII a single-planet, action-light two-hander chamber piece in which Rey and Luke Skywalker discuss the existential aesthetics of The Force. Expect lightsabers, spaceships, star jumps and metaphysical energy field battles aplenty. Disney announced in 2013 that John Williams would return to score all three new Star Wars movies, but the composer was left off the official start-of-production announcement for Episode VIII, so must go down as a maybe. One Star Wars stalwart who definitely won\u2019t be involved is series creator George Lucas, who made it clear last year that Disney were not at all interested in his own ideas for taking the saga forward. So sadly, we will now never know what happened to Jar Jar Binks\u2019s grandchildren. The mildly worrying rewrites One of the strangest stories to emerge about Johnson\u2019s film is that it was delayed by seven months \u2013 15 December, 2017 is the new release date \u2013 for the director to refocus his story on newly popular characters from The Force Awakens (such as Rey and John Boyega\u2019s Finn). Was the sequel originally going to be a prequel about Bala-Tik and the Guavian Death Gang\u2019s early years of reaving in the outer rim territories? The locations We know the planet of Ahch-To, where Rey finally found Skywalker, will appear in Episode VIII because production briefly revisited the island of Skellig Michael (where The Force Awakens was shot) in September. New photographs suggest the legendary Rebel Alliance hero\u2019s Jedi Temple is being built from the ground up for the new instalment, though in a different part of Ireland, Ceann Sib\u00e9al on the Dingle peninsula in Kerry. Meanwhile, the famous stone steps from the denouement of The Force Awakens have been recreated at Pinewood Studios in London. There have been rumours that Episode VIII will see a recovered Finn investigating the underbelly of a city on a key Republic planet in the company of a new character played by Kelly Marie Tran. The most likely candidate here appears to be Dubrovnik in Croatia, where Disney was shooting in March. Reports and photographs hint our heroes will ride a kind of alien horse through a backdrop of well-to-do citizens wearing the space equivalent of black tie formal wear. One scene is expected to involve an exploding landspeeder. There have also been reports that Episode VIII will shoot in Mexico and Las Vegas, desert areas west of the latter doubling for new scenes on Rey\u2019s home planet of Jakku. Returning heroes and extant apostles of evil Pretty much every single key castmember of The Force Awakens has been confirmed to return, bar Harrison Ford\u2019s unfortunate Solo. So we can expect to see if Andy Serkis\u2019s Supreme Leader Snoke really does dwarf Adam Driver\u2019s Kylo Ren as the Darth Vader wannabe heads off to complete his dark side studies, and we ought to learn more than a little about Rey\u2019s past now that she\u2019s teamed up with the last surviving Jedi. It\u2019s also vital that we learn how Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Maz Kanata came by Skywalker\u2019s lightsaber, who Max von Sydow\u2019s Lor San Tekka was (though spin-off Rogue One might get there first) and most crucially of all \u2026 how Gwendoline Christie\u2019s Captain Phasma gets out of the garbage compactor alive to wreak shiny chrome-plated revenge on poor Finn. Debutants in the Star Wars universe Tran, Benicio Del Toro and Laura Dern have all been confirmed as new cast members. Rumours abound that Dern will play a rival Resistance leader who takes over when Leia becomes incapacitated, while Del Toro is expected to be a villain based on the core world visited by Finn. Tran\u2019s character is rumoured to be a flirty love interest for our hero, which would certainly upset all those fans hoping the former Stormtrooper finally gets a room with Oscar Isaac\u2019s Poe Dameron in the new instalment."
"4||Florida's coral reefs rapidly 'wasting away' under stress of climate changeFlorida\u2019s coral reefs are disintegrating far more quickly than previously thought, with warming, acidifying oceans causing a \u201cwasting away\u201d of the coral structures that support an abundance of marine life, new research has found. Scientists had previously thought that Florida\u2019s reef, the only barrier reef in the continental US, wouldn\u2019t start to break up until around 2050. But recent analysis shows that this process is already under way in parts of the reef system, driven by accelerating climate change. \u201cWe don\u2019t have as much time as we previously thought,\u201d said Chris Langdon, a professor at the University of Miami and a senior author of the study. \u201cThe reefs are beginning to dissolve away.\u201d Langdon\u2019s team spent two years surveying a 200km (124-mile) tract of Florida\u2019s reef, stretching from Biscayne national park to the Florida Keys. The scientists found that the upper Florida Keys are in significant decline, well ahead of the expected \u201ctipping point\u201d where the warming oceans severely curtail coral development. As human activity pumps out greenhouse gases, the Earth\u2019s oceans have acted as a sort of sponge, sucking up huge quantities of carbon dioxide. This extra heat has caused the oceans to warm and expand, causing the sea level to rise, fueled by the melting of polar ice. The excess carbon dioxide has also caused the oceans to become more than 30% more acidic over the past century. This hinders the ability of corals to form their limestone structures, as well shellfish and mollusks to form their shells. Fish behavior has also been altered by the saturation of CO2, studies have found. Normally, Florida\u2019s coral limestone grows in the spring and summer months, aided by favorable water temperature, light and seagrass growth conditions. In winter, this process slows or even reverses as seagrasses decay and the light wanes. The University of Miami study, published in Global Biogeochemical Cycles, found that falling ocean pH, caused by acidification, is overwhelming the spring and summer growth of corals, meaning that the Florida reefs are being pushed into structural decline. \u201cThe reefs are wasting away,\u201d Langdon said. \u201cEach year, the reefs are going to lose some of their structure. This is one more reason why we need to get serious about reducing carbon dioxide emission sooner rather than later.\u201d Florida\u2019s reef is home to 100 coral species and more than 400 fish species, making it one of the most important reef systems in the world. It faces a number of pressures, however, with dredging of the seabed for port expansion causing corals to be smothered by silt. The grandson of famed ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau recently warned that plans to expand a port at Fort Lauderdale were \u201clunacy\u201d due to the impact upon the corals. Globally, coral reefs are undergoing a widespread bleaching event, driven by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon and climate change. Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef has experienced widespread bleaching, which is where prolonged high temperatures cause the coral to expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to whiten. This can lead to the coral completely dying off. Although coral reefs are found in less than 1% of the surface area of the world\u2019s oceans, they support a riot of biodiversity, with 25% of the Earth\u2019s marine creatures relying upon them for food and shelter. Corals are creatures that take root on the ocean floor, using their tiny, tentacle-like arms to capture food from the water. Coral polyps secrete a hard outer skeleton of limestone that attaches to rocks or other polyps, helping form reef structures. The loss of coral reefs would have devastating consequences throughout the aquatic food chain and impact the 500 million people around the world who rely upon them for food and income."
"1||European commission faces challenge to grant visa-free travel to TurksThe European commission faces an uphill battle to grant Turkish citizens visa-free travel through most of Europe by the end of June, a crucial element of the EU\u2019s deal with Ankara to curb refugee arrivals. A related plan to overhaul asylum rules was also running into trouble just hours after it was unveiled on Wednesday, as central European countries denounced the measures as ridiculous and tantamount to blackmail. The EU executive on Wednesday gave its provisional blessing to visa-free travel for Turkish tourists and short-stay travellers to the Schengen Area, which excludes the UK and Ireland. It backed the scheme on the condition that Ankara upgrades laws on anti-corruption, terrorism and data protection in the next few weeks. In another important caveat, visa-free travel would only be available to those Turks with biometric passports that include fingerprint recognition chips. Such passports do not exist in Turkey, although the government plans to introduce them from 1 June. The promise of visa-free travel through Europe was a key part of the bargain EU leaders struck with Turkey to stop the flow of migrants and refugees onto the Greek islands. But Hungary has already rejected the plans, while MEPs vowed to block them unless Turkey stops using anti-terror laws to \u201csilence\u201d journalists. The final decision on whether Turkish citizens will get visa-free access to the Schengen Area for stays of up to three months rests with the EU\u2019s 28 member states and the European parliament. All 28 EU leaders signed off on the goal of easing visa rules as part of the refugee deal struck with Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, in March, but there are no guarantees the deal will go through. The proposals will face opposition in the European parliament, as MEPs insist they will not be bounced into a decision. The two largest groups in the parliament, the centre-right EPP and the Socialists, said they would not back the visa plan unless Turkey met all 72 of the EU conditions. \u201cThe European parliament should vote on visa liberalisation only if Turkey meets all the criteria and after the EU ministers for interior affairs have thoroughly reviewed the situation,\u201d said the EPP leader, Manfred Weber. Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the smaller Liberal group, urged MEPs to block the proposal unless Turkey revised its anti-terrorist legislation, which, he said had been used \u201cin a brutal clampdown on Turkish and foreign journalists by the Turkish government\u201d. He also called for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to drop charges against Jan B\u00f6hmermann, a German comedian, who is being prosecuted in Germany for lampooning the Turkish president in an offensive poem. B\u00f6hmermann criticised the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Tuesday for agreeing to Ankara\u2019s request to prosecute him for offending a foreign leader. EU home affairs ministers will discuss the visa plans next month. The commission on Wednesday tried to assuage French and German concerns by proposing an emergency \u201csnapback mechanism\u201d that would allow the EU to suspend visa-free travel for six months if there were a surge in Turkish nationals staying illegally in Europe or a jump in asylum applications. But this seems unlikely to placate members of Merkel\u2019s own party, who have been sceptical, while its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, actively opposes the deal. \u201cWe cannot swap the wave of refugees for a wave of visa applications,\u201d said the CSU party secretary, Andreas Scheuer. \u201cWe are against importing inner-Turkish conflicts to Germany.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a former French prime minister and presidential candidate for the centre-right R\u00e9publicains, also come out against visa liberalisation for Turkey. \u201cThe decision of the European commission is not acceptable as it stands,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. The visa proposal is unlikely to result in an immediate surge of Turkish visitors to the 26-country Schengen zone. Only 10% of Turkey\u2019s 79m people have passports and none have the EU-standard biometric documents required, which will be produced in runs of up to 10,000 a day from June. Although the UK is not directly affected, Brexit campaigners seized on the visa recommendation. The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, said it was \u201ca huge error of judgment\u201d and claimed Turkey had moved a step closer to EU membership. \u201cThe chaos from the beaches of Greece has evidently moved to the corridors of Brussels. The EU has rolled over to the blackmail from President Erdo\u011fan.\u201d As recently as 20 April, Turkey had met only half the EU\u2019s 72 criteria for visa-free travel, a list that includes introducing biometric passports, stepping up border controls and guaranteeing fundamental rights for minority groups, such as Roma citizens. Ankara has been racing to meet the standards, even chartering a private plane to rush hastily-ratified treaties to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. But five conditions still need to be cleared, including passing anti-corruption laws, rewriting domestic law on terrorism to avoid conflicts with freedom of expression, and bringing data protection rules in line with EU standards. The vice-president of the commission, Frans Timmermans, insisted Turkey was not getting a free ride. He defended the EU\u2019s approach to engaging with Ankara, even though he stressed that Turkey was moving away from Europe on democratic standards and freedom of the media. \u201cIn the past years of not engaging with Turkey, in just shouting over the fence at each other, what has that done for human rights, the rule of law, democracy freedom of the media in Turkey? Nothing. It has only worsened,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are to come closer to the European Union, they will have to demonstrate they adhere to our values.\u201d The Turkey decision was announced as the commission published long-awaited plans to overhaul EU asylum rules, including \u201csolidarity payments\u201d of \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3198,000) per asylum seeker from countries who refused to take refugees as part of a quota system. The aim is to reduce pressure on EU\u2019s frontier states, notably Greece and Italy, which are struggling to cope with large numbers of refugees. Timmermans warned that a failure to work together could doom European unity. \u201cIf there is no solidarity here, there will be no solidarity elsewhere. And that will be a huge blow to the European project.\u201d The plea for unity was met with a volley of complaints from four central European countries, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, who denounced the asylum plans as unacceptable. Poland\u2019s interior minister, Mariusz B\u0142aszczak, said they made no sense and Hungary said they amounted to blackmail. The new rules would only apply to the UK and Ireland if they chose to take part, although successive British governments have opted into EU asylum rules, which allow them to send back asylum seekers to other member states. Home Office minister James Brokenshire told British MPs on Wednesday the government would not opt into any system with redistribution quotas. Beyond the eye-catching fines proposal, which may be unprecedented in EU refugee law, the regulation would make significant changes to the treatment of asylum seekers. Any asylum seeker that attempted to move to another EU country could be stripped of benefits other than emergency healthcare. Steve Peers, professor in EU law at Essex University, said this measure would breach the EU charter of fundamental rights, as interpreted by the European court of justice. \u201cSomeone could say that at least part of the regulation was invalid, for breach of the charter, and it is possible to strike things down for breaching the charter,\u201d he said. Peers said the commission was \u201cmore concerned about the two \u2018securitarian\u2019 objectives of sending people back to Turkey and preventing people from moving in the EU\u201d."
"9||Liverpool\u2019s Daniel Sturridge made to wait by J\u00fcrgen Klopp on semi-final roleJ\u00fcrgen Klopp has not decided whether to start Daniel Sturridge against Villarreal on Thursday despite Liverpool needing to overturn a 1-0 deficit to reach the Europa League final. Sturridge has been a substitute for Liverpool\u2019s past three games in the Europa League and was unused in the semi-final first leg defeat at El Madrigal last week. The England forward\u2019s fall from favour \u2013 he was also among the substitutes for the Merseyside derby win over Everton \u2013 has invited scrutiny of his suitability to Klopp\u2019s methods, and the 26-year-old struggled to enhance his claims during Sunday\u2019s Premier League loss at Swansea City. The forward, who has scored four goals in his past six appearances, must wait until the day of the second leg to discover whether he will start a European tie for the first time since Manchester United away on 17 March. Klopp preferred Divock Origi against Borussia Dortmund and Roberto Firmino at Villarreal with the young Belgium forward injured. But the manager insists Sturridge is in the reckoning at Anfield. \u201cI was waiting for this question,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cIt could be a game for him 100% but I have made no decision until now for the lineup. I have to think about how we start, how we can react in difficult situations and in all of these thoughts Daniel is absolutely 100% involved.\u201d Emre Can may make his first appearance since damaging ankle ligaments in the quarter-final comeback against Dortmund. The Germany international has recovered ahead of schedule and resumed training this week. Jordan Henderson, who suffered a knee injury in Dortmund that ended his domestic season and jeopardised his place at the European Championship, is also recovering well and may be fit by the time Roy Hodgson finalises his England squad this month. Klopp confirmed: \u201cEmre Can ready to return for sure. Hendo is on a good way for England but I\u2019m not too sure how good is the way for Liverpool. We have to see day by day. Only Emre returns into the squad.\u201d Dejan Lovren is confident another rousing European night at Anfield, coupled with a \u201cclever and patient\u201d display, will enable Liverpool to overcome Marcelino\u2019s side. The defender, who scored the winning goal in that remarkable fightback against Dortmund, said: \u201cEven in 2005 the fans knew that, with Liverpool, everything is possible. We have great players and great characters in the team. I think it will not be the same game as against Dortmund. They were one of the best teams in Europe and we beat them. \u201cVillarreal are a perfect counterattacking team but we need to believe in ourselves. If we do that, we can go to the final. It will be a dream come true for me, for the fans, for everyone, and we can save this season with the final but we still have to play this game. It\u2019s a big step and we need to be concentrated on that.\u201d"
"2||Markes nervous amid weak UK construction and US jobs figures  - as it happenedContinuing concerns about the state of the global economy after a series of disappointing data from around the world continued to send shares lower. Poor UK construction figures and lower than forecast US private sector job numbers from ADP were the latest repots to unsettle investors. Meanwhile oil slipped back from its early highs after a higher than expected increase in US crude stocks, while metal prices suffered on worries about China after its recent weak manufacturing figures. So commodity companies were among the biggest fallers. And there was always Donald Trump\u2019s approaching victory in the Republican nominations to provide another reason for investors to tread carefully. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 73.57 or 1.19% to a four week low of 6112.02 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.99% to 9828.25 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.09% lower at 4324.23 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.17% to 17,935.67 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.26% at 8654.3 In Greece, the Athens market bucked the trend, adding 1.1% to 590.05 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 111 points or 0.6%, while Brent crude is down 0.49% at $44.75 a barrel. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In its statement, the ECB said: It has decided to permanently stop producing the \u20ac500 banknote and to exclude it from the Europa series, taking into account concerns that this banknote could facilitate illicit activities. The issuance of the \u20ac500 will be stopped around the end of 2018, when the \u20ac100 and \u20ac200 banknotes of the Europa series are planned to be introduced. As expected, the European Central Bank has said it will no longer produce or issue \u20ac500 notes. It added that existing notes will still remain legal tender and retain their value. UK prime minister David Cameron is giving evidence to a Commons committee on the EU referendum, and my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering the meeting, beginning here. The mixed picture from the day\u2019s US economic figures does not mean a June rate rise is completely off the table. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today\u2019s abundance of US data has made for a difficult trading environment, with contrasting data points providing mixed expectations for monetary policy implications. The overwhelmingly positive release of services and composite PMI readings helped paint an encouraging picture for US business, with improved factory orders and trade balance helping raise rate hike expectations for the June meeting. However, the picture has been muddled by a shockingly poor April ADP non-farm payrolls number, which at 156,000 fell to the lowest level in over two years. The ADP reading is the only figure of the day that has a second bite at the cherry and if Friday\u2019s headline figure confounds today\u2019s ADP weakness, we are likely to see a significant rise in June rate hike expectations. The resurgence of the US dollar this week has sent shockwaves throughout the foreign exchange markets, as traders begin to realise that perhaps a 15-month low in the dollar index makes little sense just six weeks away from an increasingly \u2018live\u2019 [Federal Reserve] meeting. While markets are currently pricing in just a 12% chance of a June hike, the reality is likely to be higher, given the hawkish tone of recent Fed member comments. US crude stocks rose by more than expected last week, according to the latest figures from the Energy Information Administration. Inventories climbed by 2.8m barrels compared to forecasts of a 750,000 increase. Crude prices have come off their best levels following the figures, but even so, Brent is still up 0.8% at $45.33 a barrel. Earlier in the day it had climbed as high as $46.01. And here\u2019s the agenda for Monday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, including talks on the Greece\u2019s debt: The Eurogroup will hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the state of play of the macroeconomic adjustment programme for Greece. Discussions will cover a comprehensive package of policy reforms as well as the sustainability of Greece\u2019s public debt. Both elements need to be in place in order to finalise the programme\u2019s first review and unlock further financial assistance to Greece. Over in Greece, and efforts are continuing to reach a deal between the country and its creditors ahead of a proposed Eurogroup meeting next week. Greek newspaper Kathimerini reports: Deputy eurozone finance ministers, known as the Euro Working Group (EWG), will hold a conference call on Wednesday aimed at bridging differences between the government in Athens and foreign creditors ahead of a crucial eurogroup meeting on Monday, May 9. The teleconference is expected to focus on an additional 3.6 billion euros\u2019 worth of contingency measures that Greece is being asked to implement should it miss budget targets in 2018. The extra measures have been demanded by the International Monetary Fund, which deems that the 5.4 billion euros\u2019 worth of measures set out in Greece\u2019s third international bailout are inadequate for it to achieve a budget surplus worth 3.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2018. Greek officials have instead proposed the activation of an automatic mechanism for cutting state spending in the event that the government misses budget targets. IMF officials are also expected to take part in Wednesday\u2019s teleconference. Greece will be represented by Alternate Finance Minister Giorgos Houliarakis. And here are some of the comments made by the survey\u2019s respondents: \u201cSevere non-skilled labor shortage is hurting the construction industry.\u201d (Construction) \u201cBusiness is holding steady, revenue is almost as anticipated and costs are lower which is helping to maintain current profitability.\u201d (Finance &amp; Insurance) \u201cWe expect our business condition to improve in Q2 as compared to Q1. Typically, Q1 is our slowest period and business activity picks up later through the year.\u201d (Health Care &amp; Social Assistance) \u201cVery favorable cost conditions all around.\u201d (Accommodation &amp; Food Services) \u201cIn higher education we are gearing up for the summer conference season. This impacts (increases) the spend in our service category and drives income from many campuses.\u201d (Educational Services) \u201cRecent upturn in oil prices is creating a slightly more positive outlook for those in the energy industry, but has not been enough to initiate hiring or spending.\u201d (Professional, Scientific &amp; Technical Services) \u201cBusiness is still improving. Trucking has tightened due to produce hauling season.\u201d (Wholesale Trade) \u201cHeading into a slower season, but cautious optimism of modest gains from same period last year.\u201d (Retail Trade) Here are the details of the ISM survey: And here\u2019s is confirmation of a stronger US services sector. The ISM non-manufacturing purchasing managers index has climbed from 54.5 in March to 55.7 last month, better than the forecast level of 54.7. This is the highest level since December. The new orders index rose to 59.9 in April, up from 56.7 the previous month. But business activity slowed, with the index dipping from 59.8 in March to 58.8. The first set of US services data is out and is slightly better than expected. The Markit services final PMI has come in at 52.8 for April, up from the initial reading of 52.1 and March\u2019s level of 51.3. The final composite reading - both services and manufacturing - was 52.4, up from an initial 51.7 and 51.3 in March. Still to come are the figures from ISM\u2019s services survey. Not surprisingly US markets are once more following their global counterparts lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 106 points or 0.6%, following the weaker than expected ADP jobs data. The disappointing figures added to the general unease about a whole spate of releases pointing to a slowdown in the global economy. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened around 0.5% lower. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has fallen 0.99% - albeit off its worst levels - while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.74% and France\u2019s Cac is off 0.77%. More from the US. The country\u2019s trade deficit fell by more than expected in March, down 13.9% to $40.4bn, as imports fell to their lowest level since 2010. Meanwhile US productivity dropped at a 1% annual rate in the first quarter, the second quarterly decline. Labour costs rose by 4.1%, the quickest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics which helps compile the ADP jobs data, said: The job market appears to have stumbled in April. Job growth noticeably slowed, with some weakness across most sectors. One month does not make a trend, but this bears close watching as the financial market turmoil earlier in the year may have done some damage to business hiring. The poor ADP jobs data adds to the feeling the US Federal Reserve may not be in a rush to raise interest rates but the report is worrying for the US economy, says David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco. He said: The US dollar fell sharply in the immediate aftermath of the release as poor jobs data reduces the likelihood of a rate hike next month from the US Fed. Investors see the ADP data as a \u201cheads-up\u201d ahead of the official Non-Farm Payroll report which is due out this Friday. It certainly is effective in measuring the overall trend in the data, but it can be patchy on a month-by-month basis. This is because the government\u2019s number tends to be considerably more volatile, and of course it is this volatility that traders look for and react to. So the fact that today\u2019s release was so far away from trend will have traders scratching their heads. It may be positive for risk assets for the Fed to hold off from hiking rates, but it sends a grim message about the US economy. Ahead of Friday\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers, the monthly survey of private sector jobs from ADP came in much lower than expected. ADP said US employment increased by 156,000 private sector jobs in April, compared to 194,000 last month and expectations of a rise of between 195,000 and 200,000 this time round. Last month\u2019s figure was revised down from the initial estimate of 200,000. London Stock Exchange shares have dropped more than 7% after Intercontinental Exchange ruled out a bid, leaving the way clear for LSE\u2019s proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. New York stock exchange owner ICE said in March it was considering an offer for the LSE, but now says: Following due diligence on the information made available, ICE determined there was insufficient engagement to confirm the potential market and shareholder benefits of a strategic combination. So it has \u201cno current intention\u201d to make a bid which rules it out for six months unless it receives the consent of the Takeover Panel. Greek manufacturing edged higher in April, but still showed a contraction for the third month in a row. Markit\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 49.7, up from 49 in March but still below the 50 level which signals expansion. Markit said: The downturn in the manufacturing sector of Greece continued during April. Incoming new orders fell for a further month while outstanding business levels deteriorated. However, job creation was still evident in the sector and volumes of production stabilised after three months of contraction. But there were some encouraging signs, according to Markit economist Samuel Agass who said: April survey data was mixed for Greek goods producers. On the one hand, the headline PMI remains below the crucial 50.0 no-change mark, thus signalling a further downturn in the manufacturing sector of Greece. Incoming new orders are still on the decline and outstanding business levels again deteriorated at a substantial pace, with a downturn in the construction sector hampering economic growth according to panellists. However, production stabilised for the first time during 2016 and job creation was still evident, highlighting firms\u2019 intentions to invigorate future output with increased manpower. Likewise, purchasing activity rose for the first time since August 2014, highlighting that there are some encouraging signs pointing to a revival in the manufacturing sector of Greece over the coming few months. China has been forced to dip into its emergency pork reserves after seeing prices hit record highs. With breeding sows in short supply, and domestic demand swelling, Beijing has decided to release 3.05 million kilograms of frozen pork reserves over the next month. The FT explains how pork prices have been sizzling recently: Policymakers have good reason to want to keep pork prices under control: China produces and consumes more pork than any other country on Earth, and the meat factors heavily into the CPI basket used to calculate overall consumer inflation. In March the official consumer price index rose 2.3 per cent year on year, with a rise of 28.4 per cent by pork prices during the period contributing 0.64 percentage points. The pork crisis could also be a consequence of China\u2019s industrial revolution. There are now more wealthier middle-class consumers bringing home the bacon, and keen to eat expensive food, but fewer agricultural workers tending the piglets. European stock markets have suffered another morning of hefty losses, as economic worries ripple through trading floors again. The FTSE 100 has hit a new three-week low, down 76 points or 1.2% at 6109 points, while France and Germany are both down around 0.75% The slowdown in Britain\u2019s construction sector, following a shock contraction in manufacturing yesterday, hasn\u2019t helped the mood in the City. Disappointing Chinese and US factory data released this week has also dampened optimism. There may also be a Trump effect. Wall Street is being called down, after the Donald all-but wrapped up the Republican nomination overnight. Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, reckons investors are pretty uneasey today. \u2018\u2019A decline in US stocks last night has been followed by another weak day in Asian Indices today, as commodities and bonds are also selling off. Investors appear to remain generally uneasy about the state of the global economy, with the latest agitation coming from the Reserve Bank of Australia deciding on Tuesday to cut its benchmark rate to 1.75%, reflecting soft inflation and, like many others, general economic malaise. A contributing factor to Australia\u2019s economic woes has been a drop in demand from a weary China, which has its own problems as its economy looks to be losing steam on the back of some weak manufacturing data. Another country with weak manufacturing data is the UK \u2013 reports suggesting manufacturing activity contracted in April for the first time since March 2013. The slowdown in the oil industry is certainly hitting production, with firms also blaming soft domestic demand combined with a fall in foreign business. Here\u2019s our news story on the construction slowdown: Last Friday, we got terribly excited by the news that the eurozone had grown by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2016, outpacing Britain and America. But perhaps this was premature... New data today shows that retail sales fell by 0.5% in March, which could suggest growth was less buoyant than hoped. Carsten Brzeski of ING fears the data could be revised down in a few weeks (when eurostat will have more data to play with) The BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed and Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics are both concerned by the slowdown in UK construction growth. This drop in construction growth comes as Barclays unleashes a no-deposit mortgage on the market. Technically, a parent does need to provide a 10% deposit, but that will be returned - with interest - if their little darling manages to keep up the monthly payments. So for the first time since the collapse of Northern Rock, a major high-street lender is effectively offering to lend the full value of a property. This could be a worrying moment... However, before the credit crunch of 2007, some riskier UK banks would actually lend you 125% of a property\u2019s value. We\u2019re not quite at panic levels yet... David Noble of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply also blames Brexit fears for the slump in construction sector growth. \u201cFears over weaker UK and global economic growth dealt a blow to confidence in the construction sector, leading to delays in new spending commitments. The prospect of the EU referendum and its outcome in June are likely to add to uncertainty too, with many construction firms preferring to wait and see what happens before making any decisions. \u201cConstruction companies adopted a more cautious approach to purchasing and hiring, leading to a rise in sub-contractor usage to tide them over until the outlook becomes clearer. The slowdown in new order growth in April suggests that though spring may be in the air, sunnier times may still be a way off for the construction sector, at least for the time being.\u201d Breaking: Growth across Britain\u2019s construction sector has slowed to a near three-year low. Fears over Britain\u2019s EU referendum, and weakness in housebuilding are to blame -- as concerns about the strength of the UK recovery grow. Data firm Markit reports that its construction PMI, which measures activity across hundreds of building firms, has fallen from 54.2 in March to 52.0 in April. That\u2019s the slowest since June 2013. Companies reported that new orders had stagnated, as the clients suspended spending. With \u201cheightened uncertainty about the economic outlook\u201d, some customers aren\u2019t prepared to commit to new projects. Britain\u2019s EU vote, on June 23rd, is a key Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, warns that the UK construction sector appears to be struggling: \u201cUK construction firms reported their worst month for almost three years in April, meaning that the first quarter slowdown is unlikely to prove temporary. \u201cStalling new order volumes not only set the scene for further weakness ahead, but are already weighing on staff hiring and input buying across the construction sector. \u201cSofter growth forecasts for the UK economy alongside uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum appear to have provided reasons for clients to delay major spending decisions until the fog has lifted. \u201cAn additional factor dragging on construction sector performance is the lack of momentum in residential building. April\u2019s survey highlighted one of the weakest rises in housing activity since early-2013, suggesting that greater caution in this sub-sector is adding to the sluggish growth conditions seen across the wider construction industry.\u201d Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees that the eurozone PMIs are \u2018lacklustre\u2019, but remains hopeful that growth will pick up. While they have firmed recently, oil and commodity prices and the euro are still at levels that are supportive to Eurozone growth. Major ECB stimulus that was enhanced in March will increasingly kick in over the coming months, while the fiscal stance across the Eurozone is gradually becoming more growth orientated with increasing fiscal stimulative measures being introduced in a number of countries (along with increased public spending to deal with the influx of migrants). Meanwhile, generally improved job markets across the Eurozone are supportive to consumer spending along with the boost to purchasing power coming from negligible deflation/inflation. Europe\u2019s private sector continued to recover in April, although the revival is less than spectacular. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit, whose composite PMI (which measures private sector growth) has come in at 53.0 in April. That\u2019s only a smidgen below March\u2019s 53.1, and means 34 months of unbroken growth. The eurozone\u2019s Big Four economies all expanded, although Germany appears to be losing some momentum. Companies reported taking on more staff (although in France the increase was marginal). They were also forced to cut prices again to stimulate sales, suggesting the eurozone still face a deflation threat despite the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus measures. Markit\u2019s Chris Williamson explains: \u201cThe final PMI data confirm the earlier flash estimate that the eurozone economy grew at a steady but unspectacular annual rate of 1.5% at the start of the second quarter. Prices charged also continued to fall, indicating that growth is being partly fuelled by price discounting. \u201cHowever, while still tepid, the sustained eurozone growth contrasts with slowdowns in the US and UK, suggesting the ECB\u2019s more aggressive stimulus is helping to drive a steady recovery. The survey numbers also indicate that domestic demand within the eurozone is picking up which, alongside the weaker currency, is helping to offset sluggish external demand. So it\u2019s not all bad. German service sector growth has slowed; its PMI has dipped to 54.5, from 55.1in March. That still shows expansion, but the slowest rate since last winter. France\u2019s service sector has clawed its way back to growth, with the PMI rising to 50.6 from 49.9 in March. The first eurozone service sector data is out, and it shows that Spanish companies continued to grow last month. The Spanish Services PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, has dipped slightly to 55.1, from 55.3. That\u2019s comfortably over the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. It suggests the prospect of another election (called for late June) hasn\u2019t hit the economy. Mining shares are being hit this morning, pulling the London stock market into the red. Worries over the global economy are being blamed as BHP Billiton sheds 5% and Anglo American loses 3%. BHP is also being hit because Brazilian prosecutors have just filed a $58bn civil lawsuit over the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster which claimed 19 lives last year. Mining shares also fell sharply yesterday, after disappointing factory data from China and the UK suggested economy demand was slowing. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga warns that: The elevated concerns over the health of the global economy complimented with the incessant declines in oil prices have soured investor risk appetite, consequently leaving the FTSE100 vulnerable to further losses. The ongoing supermarket price wars have hit profits at supermarket chain J Sainsbury\u2019s. The company has posted a 14% drop in annual pretax profits, on the back of a 1.1% drop in sales. That\u2019s better than some analysts had predicted. However, CEO Mike Coupe has warned that the market will remain competitive \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d, sending shares down 1.5% in early trading. Next\u2019s warning on sales and profits could spell bad news for other retailers too. James McGregor, partner at Retail Remedy retail consultants, explains: It was inevitable that the weather would feature in some way in Next\u2019s trading update and we have not been disappointed. If Next have been challenged by the unseasonal weather this season, then we can assume that the majority of fashion retailers are really suffering..... To lower Next\u2019s full price sales guidance range to -3.5%, indicates a sense of nervousness. Ever cautious, we are not surprised to hear Lord Wolfson warn of difficult trading ahead. His caution is understandable though, poor sell throughs are costly. The weather is finally going the right way but the customer might yet hold off buying her beachwear. Retail group Next has got the morning off to a bad start, by cutting its sales guidance for the second time in two months. Once again, bad weather get some of the blame; Next says that recent cold weather in March and April reduced demand for clothing. That follows the unusually mild winter, which hit sales of warm coats. But it also warned that demand for clothing may simply be weaker, as consumers cut back. My colleague Sean Farrell has the details: Though sales have improved in the past few days as weather has improved, the company said demand for clothes could stay weak. In the three months to 2 May Next\u2019s total sales fell by 0.2% and full-price sales dropped 0.9%, at the low end of full-year sales guidance of -1% to 4%. As a result, Next cut its annual guidance for full-price sales to between -3.5% and +3.5%. It slashed its previous guidance in March when Lord Wolfson, the chief executive, predicted this year would be the most difficult since the financial crisis. Next also cut its guidance for annual profit. Pre-tax profit could fall as much as 8.9% to \u00a3748m with a best estimate of profit rising 3.7% to \u00a3852m. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After yesterday\u2019s jitteriness, traders in Europe are pretty cautious as they wait for a flurry of economic news. Today we find out how the eurozone\u2019s service sector performed last month. It may show that European consumers kept spending last month, despite signs of weakness in the global economy. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has the predictions: The Spanish economy has been notable for its outperformance in recent months despite continuing high levels of unemployment and today\u2019s latest numbers are expected to come in at 55.1, while Germany is expected to remain unchanged at 54.6. On the downside the French numbers have consistently underperformed, though we are expecting to see a pick up to 50.8 as the French services sector strives to shake off the after effects of the November attacks in Paris. Those figures come between 8am and 9am BST. We then find out how Britain\u2019s construction industry fared last month; will builders feel any impact from Brexit uncertainty? And there\u2019s plenty of company results to wade through; brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, high street retailer Next, supermarket chain J Sainsbury, oil group Shell and defence group BAE are all updating the City. In the meantime, European markets are likely to open sluggishly as investors worry about the global economic slowdown, yesterday\u2019s fall in the value of the US dollar, and political instability rising in Europe. And that\u2019s before anyone mentions Donald Trump...."
"1||Canada wildfires: worst of blazes 'still to come' after Fort McMurray evacuatedAfter a raging wildfire destroyed dozens of homes, engulfed a neighbourhood in flames, and forced the hurried evacuation of an entire city, authorities in Canada warned that the worst was probably still to come. More than 80,000 residents were ordered to leave the city of Fort McMurray in northern Alberta on Tuesday, after shifting winds saw the blaze go from being largely in control to a \u201cnasty, ugly\u201d inferno, as described by the local fire chief. Residents scrambled to make their way out of the city, sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the main route out of the city and struggling to see the road through the thick grey haze that blanketed the highway. Flames licked the road and ash rained down on vehicles, while air tankers and helicopters flew overhead. Gas pumps soon ran dry, leaving many residents stranded on the highway overnight. \u201c[With] the heat from the oncoming smoke and the flames, you could see mini-tornadoes forming near the road,\u201d resident Jordan Stuffco told the Canadian Press. \u201cIt was something out of an apocalyptic movie.\u201d Authorities warned that the hot, dry and windy weather expected on Wednesday would probably fuel the fire, which started on Sunday. \u201cThe worst of the fire is not over,\u201d said Bernie Schmitte of Alberta Agriculture and Forestry. \u201cWe\u2019re still faced with very high temperatures, low relative humidity and some strong winds.\u201d Officials said the fire had grown from about 1,200 hectares to span more than 10,000 hectares in the past two days. \u201cWe had a devastating day yesterday and we are preparing for a bad day today,\u201d local fire chief Darby Allen said on Wednesday. \u201cWe successfully evacuated 88,000 people. No one is hurt and no one is passed away right now. I really hope we can get to the end of this and we can still say that.\u201d He described the wildfire as a \u201cnasty, dirty fire\u201d that was raging out of control, adding that all efforts to suppress it have so far failed. \u201cThere are areas of the city that have not been burned, but this fire will look for them, and it will find them, and it will try and take them.\u201d On Tuesday, 105 patients and clients \u2013 including nine newborn babies \u2013 were evacuated from city\u2019s only hospital as flames approached.The province\u2019s main oil sands region, a number of oil sands work camps near Fort McMurray were turned into impromptu housing for evacuees. Neighbouring communities also reached out to residents as they fled the flames, staffing recreation centres to provide shelter and bringing gas to stranded motorists. Other residents made their way to the evacuation camps that had been set up outside the city or found lodging in the city of Edmonton, some 435km away, where they took stock of what they had left behind. \u201cWhen you leave \u2026 it\u2019s an overwhelming feeling to think that you\u2019ll never see your house again,\u201d Carol Christian told the Canadian Press. Along with her son and cat, she had driven to an evacuation centre. \u201cIt was absolutely horrifying when we were sitting there in traffic. You look up and then you watch all the trees candle-topping \u2026 up the hills where you live and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Oh my God. We got out just in time.\u2019\u201d Municipal authorities on Wednesday began detailing the damage that had been caused by the wildfire, including one neighbourhood where 80% of the homes were destroyed. Images on social media showed the flattened neighbourhood of Beacon Hill, the rubble of its many destroyed homes strewn about. In another neighbourhood, a dozen trailers also went up in flames, while serious losses were reported in several other areas. Officials estimate that 1,600 structures have so far been damaged or destroyed by the fire. Some in the city had as little as 30 minutes to evacuate, with many making it out with little more than their vehicle and the clothes on their back. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time for nothing,\u201d said Shawn Brett. He had been at home when his friends called to warn him of the encroaching blaze. He jumped on his Harley motorcycle and made his way out, fighting his way through the smoke and flames that had engulfed his neighbourhood. \u201cI literally drove through the flames. I had ashes hitting my face and the heat from the fire was that bad,\u201d he told the the Canadian Press. \u201cEverything was jammed. It was nothing but the biggest chaos I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, said on Wednesday he had spoken to the Alberta premier, Rachel Notley, to offer the government\u2019s support. \u201cI really do want to highlight that Canada is a country where we look out for our neighbours, and we are there for each other in difficult times,\u201d Trudeau told his Liberal caucus. \u201cAnd certainly in Fort McMurray, the difficult times they are going through right now is something that we are going to unite around.\u201d He shot down earlier comments made by Elizabeth May, the leader of Canada\u2019s Green Party, that linked the fire to the global climate crisis. \u201cOne thing we know is that with climate change there will be more extreme events,\u201d said Trudeau. \u201cBut, we know very well that placing a direct link between any fire or a flood and climate change goes a step beyond what is helpful and does not benefit a conversation we must have.\u201d The premier of Alberta said on Wednesday that she planned to head to Fort McMurray to get a firsthand look at the scope of the crisis. \u201cOur hearts are with the families who have had to leave their homes in Fort McMurray,\u201d said Notley from Edmonton. Nearby communities have sent emergency personnel and vehicles to the city. The provincial government has also been in continuous contact with other provinces and the federal government, she said, and now has the resources needed to battle the blaze. \u201cBut of course the weather is the key issue.\u201d Queen Elizabeth said she was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the news of the wildfires \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been affected, and we send our heartfelt thanks to the firefighters and the other emergency workers,\u201d she said in a statement. The wildfire comes as a devastating blow to a city already reeling from the impact of slumping oil prices, said David Yurdiga, the MP for the area. The Alberta oil sands rank as one of the world\u2019s largest reserves of oil. \u201cEven with the destruction caused by the fire thus far we will need federal funds to get back on our feet,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cThis city has seen thousands of people leave their homes because of the downturn in oil. Fort McMurray cannot handle that and this wildfire.\u201d"
"2||Chancellor says banks' payments to regulators are tax deductiblePayments by banks to the City regulator are \u201ca routine cost of doing business\u201d, which means they can be deducted from their tax bills, according to George Osborne. The chancellor set out his view in a letter to Andrew Tyrie, who has been seeking clarity from the Treasury after changes in the budget stopped banks being able to deduct compensation paid to customers from their tax bill. That move, aimed at the billions handed out in compensation for payment protection insurance, is expected to add \u00a31bn to banks\u2019 tax payments in the next five years. Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, had wanted to know whether fines and other payments to regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority would be covered by the change. In a letter dated 4 April, Osborne wrote: \u201cPayments made to regulators are generally deductible for corporation tax purposes. This applies to routine payments made by banks operating in the UK to regulatory authorities to cover the cost of their supervision and oversight.\u201d The chancellor added that payments banks make to the regulators to cover investigations - often known as section 166s - are also deductible, so that banks which have not made any errors are not penalised. This is in line with the tax treatment given to law firms, accountants and those in the oil and gas sector when making payments to regulators. Tyrie, though, is on guard for the currently hypothetical situation that payments made by banks, which might be construed as fines, should create tax benefits for banks. \u201cAs long as regulatory payments are made by compliant and non-compliant alike, it is reasonable that they should be treated as a cost of doing business and therefore tax deductible. But in cases where such payments are tantamount to fines, they should not be tax deductible,\u201d Tyrie said. In an earlier letter, dated 15 February, the chancellor had said that fines should not be able to offset tax bills. \u201cI can confirm that fines imposed as a punishment by regulators are non-deductible for UK corporation tax purposes,\u201d Osborne said. In the wake of the Libor rigging scandal, Osborne changed the way that fines were used. In the past they had gone back the regulator, but after the public outcry that followed the \u00a3290m fine imposed on Barclays they have have been used to fund a variety of things, including military charities."
"7||Kieren Fallon returns to Chester with winner aboard Sir MaximilianRoyal Ascot may be the next target for Sir Maximilian, a winner here on Wednesday, and a jockey who many assumed was slowly fading from view hopes to be going along for the ride. Kieren Fallon, six times the British champion and a man whose career has been more chequered than a chessboard, was grinning broadly as he climbed onto the podium after Sir Maximilian\u2019s victory. Fallon, it seems, is back. Again, and at least for now. Fallon has been only an occasional visitor to British tracks over the last two seasons, preferring instead to spend much of his time in the United States. He had a single winner and nine second-place finishes from 82 rides there in 2015, and no success at all from 14 rides this year before returning to Ireland, where he has formed a promising new link with Michael O\u2019Callaghan, who trains on The Curragh. Fallon enjoyed an easy victory on the speedy Sir Maximilian, a horse that has lined up for Group One events in the past, and could now be aimed towards the King\u2019s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot in mid-June by Ian Williams, his trainer. \u201cI like coming here, but it\u2019s just hard to get rides now,\u201d Fallon said afterwards. \u201cToo many jockeys and not enough horses, and some of the jockeys are getting too old and nobody wants them, but we\u2019ll still battle away. As long as I can get rides, I\u2019ll ride away, and I don\u2019t want to retire yet. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying it for the first time in a long time and I\u2019m feeling much better now than I did last year. They\u2019ve got a great doctor in Ireland, [the Turf Club\u2019s senior medical officer Adrian] McGoldrick, and he\u2019s sorted me out. \u201cLast year my riding was very weak and I had a lot of blood tests and things, but he was able to sort it. I didn\u2019t feel right at all for the second half of the season and I didn\u2019t know where I wanted to be. It was a blessing in disguise when Michael rang and asked me to go back to Ireland, because I had to go and do a medical and that\u2019s when things started to turn around for me.\u201d Even by the standards of this most mercurial of professions, Fallon\u2019s career has been one of wild extremes. There have been Classics, championships and double-century seasons thanks to a succession of top jobs and brilliant horses. And there have been drug bans, tabloid stings, high-profile sackings, a six-month suspension for hauling a fellow jockey from his horse and the intense scrutiny of a collapsed race-fixing trial at the Old Bailey. How long will it all continue? Fallon, now 51, is as reluctant as ever to look too far into the future. \u201cIt depends on your body,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky, I\u2019m not like some of the boys that have to waste hard in the sauna for many hours. I can eat and drink what I want, my weight\u2019s great and, thank God, I had a great career in that I didn\u2019t have too many injuries. I think when you put those together, you will last a bit longer. \u201cI went to ride in San Francisco before I came back, and I was riding against Russell Baze, who is 58. He was riding two or three winners a day, a leading jockey there for however many years. You have to ride with confidence, and if you don\u2019t ride with confidence you\u2019re always going to struggle, but I\u2019m with a great trainer in Ireland now and hopefully we\u2019ll start churning out the winners very shortly. \u201cI want to ride and be busy. If I\u2019m not, there\u2019s not a lot else I want to do and I want to do it as long as I can. It\u2019s great when you get on horses like that [Sir Maximilian] that can cruise and then quicken away, it makes the job easy and you get a bit of a buzz. The way he quickened away there was impressive.\u201d"
"19||Bristol mayoral hopefuls sling 'elite' jibesThe two main candidates in the race to become mayor of Bristol \u2013 one of the key electoral tests for Labour on Thursday \u2013 have each claimed the other is the \u201cestablishment\u201d figure. Marvin Rees, the Labour candidate, accused George Ferguson, the charismatic red trouser-wearing independent who has held the position for the past four years, of being a member of a wealthy elite group that had controlled Bristol for decades. Ferguson said Labour was the political establishment in Bristol and suggested that if Rees won power he would put the party before the city. Bristol is undoubtedly an important target for Labour. The party was devastated when Rees lost to Ferguson at the last election in 2012 and has worked hard for him this time, with Jeremy Corbyn and other senior party figures visiting and campaigning hard. Rees said a win for him in Bristol, and for Sadiq Khan in London, would signal real political change. \u201cI think the Bristol election is important to national Labour. In myself and Sadiq you see evidence of the fact that Labour offers real political change. Look at our backgrounds. Sadiq is the son of a bus driver, I\u2019m the mixed race son of a single white woman who spent time in a refuge. The support of the Labour party has enabled myself and Sadiq to try to become mayors of two world cities. I think that matters politically.\u201d Ferguson, a successful architect and entrepreneur, makes much of his detachment from all political parties. \u201cBut he is establishment,\u201d Rees claimed. \u201cWhether someone runs with a party or not, if you\u2019re part of a group and that group has been running the city for a long time then however you badge yourself you\u2019re still in that group.\u201d He accepted that Ferguson had been good at creating a buzz in Bristol but argued that he had not done enough for the poorest in society. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about running festivals and celebrations, it\u2019s about making Bristol work for everybody. This is a ferociously prosperous city that is increasingly unaffordable, and where the gap between rich and poor is widening. That has to be the focus. This is not just a moral crisis, it\u2019s a strategic crisis. All over the world people are saying we cannot build coherent society if we don\u2019t tackle inequality. We\u2019ll eat ourselves. [Ferguson] is absolutely establishment. Running a viable campaign as an independent is a privilege. Without the support of Labour I wouldn\u2019t exist as a candidate. Political parties aren\u2019t perfect. The alternative is just political positions for rich people,\u201d Rees said. The two clashed on Wednesday over an article produced by the media cooperative the Bristol Cable, which made allegations concerning the sale of council land to Bristol Port and the alleged possibility of fracking there. Ferguson, and the council, said the story was untrue. Ferguson said he had insisted on a contract to help ensure fracking could not take place and accused Labour of using a false story to smear him. He said: \u201cI\u2019m sad that we\u2019ve got the typical old party politics working, especially at this stage in an election. It\u2019s cynical and it\u2019s trying to divert from the real issues. To me it\u2019s a desperate move. I\u2019m disgusted by it. It\u2019s exactly the kind of politics that I don\u2019t want this city to go back to. I stand as an independent for clear leadership and against playing party politics of that sort.\u201d Reacting to the claims of Rees that he was an establishment figure, Ferguson said: \u201cThat\u2019s his game. I think anyone who knows me knows I\u2019m very independent, I\u2019ve led cities across the world in environmental change, I am tackling some of the fundamental issues in this city. \u201cI\u2019m getting more people into jobs, I\u2019m determined that we target some of the more challenged areas of this city, that we bring the failing schools up to the highest possible standard. I\u2019m able to do these things because I\u2019ve got the life experience and skills to do that. I\u2019m afraid that if it went back to the old politics there would be the divided loyalties between party and city, and that is the establishment. \u201cThis is about implementing the programme I\u2019ve started. I can hit the ground running in order to deliver the transport infrastructure the old parties failed to deliver for the last 50 years, to deliver the housing infrastructure. I want to make sure we do something radical in this city, deliver the big projects such as an arena but above all make sure the whole city shares in this success.\u201d There are also votes for directly elected mayors in Salford and Liverpool, where Labour candidates are expected to win. The Bristol result, where votes will be counted on Saturday, is set to be very close."
"9||Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s new generation buy into Diego Simeone\u2019s masterplanThe question was phrased gently enough but Diego Simeone could feel the dig. It was put to the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid manager that Pep Guardiola, his vanquished Bayern Munich counterpart, had said there had been contrasting styles at play during the Champions League semi-final; different footballing cultures. Guardiola had just highlighted how Bayern had played to win in Tuesday\u2019s second leg with their trademark front-foot football, and against \u201cvery defensive\u201d opponents but, despite doing so 2-1 on the night at the Allianz Arena, it was not enough to avoid an away-goals exit. Guardiola did say that Atl\u00e9tico had played well and deserved to go through, while he talked of the pride he had in his players and the essential purity of their game. It was simply one of those occasions when the margins went against him and Bayern. It was football. So, what did Simeone think? Did he feel the same about the culture clash? \u201cI don\u2019t understand your question,\u201d Simeone replied. \u201cIs this about a short passing game or what? What is your question? What are you trying to get at?\u201d Simeone knew perfectly well but the question was repackaged for him. \u201cWe tried to play with the characteristics that we have, with the players that we have available to us and I think that we have now played against two of the best three teams in Europe,\u201d he said, referencing the quarter-final victory over Barcelona that had set up the Bayern tie. \u201cWe have knocked them both out and we have got through to the final. That does show that we have really given good performances, especially at home. In Barcelona and in Munich, we had to suffer but we could react to that and I\u2019m very proud about that.\u201d Simeone was pugnacious to the last. And so were his players. He and they had suffered, particularly after Fernando Torres\u2019s penalty miss in the 85th minute that could have soothed their nerves. Instead, Simeone appeared close to meltdown during the five added minutes, although it is easy to see this as his default touchline setting. Atl\u00e9tico always suffer. Their matches are often tight. But few teams know how to cope with the tension of a slender advantage better than them. And although Bayern hogged the ball and the statistics showed that they had 35 attempts on goal, 12 of them on target, the reality was that there were precious few moments in the second half when they blew big chances. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s progress was testament to the streetwise qualities that Simeone has instilled, to how this team is more than the sum of its parts. Moreover, the manner in which he has instilled a freshness has been impressive. New players have been integrated, including exciting young ones, but they have bought wholesale into the basic tenets of Simeone\u2019s style \u2013 the drive and intensity that have underpinned his glorious four-and-a-half year tenure. It is remarkable to think that from the 18-man matchday squad for the Champions League semi-final, second leg against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in 2014, which Atl\u00e9tico won 3-1 to advance to the final, there were only four survivors for the Bayern tie on Tuesday. It would have been five but Tiago is out injured while Gabi, the captain, was unavailable at Chelsea. The quartet were the defenders Diego God\u00edn, Juanfran and Filipe Lu\u00eds, and the midfielder, Koke. Gone are Thibaut Courtois, Arda Turan, Diego Costa, Toby Alderweireld, Diego and David Villa. Simeone has introduced and created new stars such as the goalkeeper Jan Oblak, the centre-half Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez, the wingers Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez and Yannick Carrasco, and the striker Antoine Griezmann, who is the veteran of the bunch at 25. The others are 23 or under. Renewal has been a principle theme of the Atl\u00e9tico story. \u201cWhat has changed since that Chelsea semi-final is that we\u2019ve got a lot of new players,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cI would say it\u2019s about 10 new players. We had more experience back then. We had Costa, [Jos\u00e9] Sosa \u2013 players who were 28, 29 years old. Now, we have a lot of young players who have learned and really improved. Sa\u00fal, for example, has shown what he can do and that is something that makes me very proud. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard in the last four and a half years and we have improved as a team. It\u2019s not just a coincidence that we\u2019re doing so well. It just shows the ambition of the club. We have a lot of players who are really behind us. Juanfran, Koke, Filipe Lu\u00eds, Fernando [Torres], Griezmann \u2013 players who have really played well and have adapted well to this team. It\u2019s fantastic to see this. The truth is that we love the way we play.\u201d The victory over Chelsea was a decisive point in Simeone\u2019s growth and that of the club. Even though he had already won the Europa League, the European Super Cup [in which Atl\u00e9tico hammered Chelsea 4-1, with that hat-trick from Radamel Falcao] and the Copa del Rey, the step into the final of Europe\u2019s elite competition brought further confidence. A few weeks later, God\u00edn\u2019s equaliser at Barcelona would bring them the last-day point they needed to win La Liga. They almost won the Champions League final, too, with only the stoppage-time equaliser from Real\u2019s Sergio Ramos denying them. Real would win 4-1 in extra time. Atl\u00e9tico now have another shot at their first European Cup. The success in the second leg against Bayern offered the latest illustration of Simeone\u2019s tactical intelligence, his ability decisively to alter the flow of a game. Bayern had controlled the first half and they might have been further in front than 1-0. Simeone brought on Carrasco at half-time and he switched from 4-4-2 to 4-5-1, with Griezmann moved from striker to right winger and Carrasco on the left. Atl\u00e9tico began to get up the pitch with more assurance and when Griezmann streaked away for his one on one with Manuel Neuer in the 54th minute, the greatest compliment you could pay him was that you knew he would score. It was the Frenchman\u2019s 31st goal of the season in all competitions. \u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cThe way that we performed, also in the last minutes \u2013 it\u2019s just unbelievable. It was great to see how my team played with such intensity. We had a good chat at half-time, we discussed what we wanted to achieve and we won the game. We were really good defensively and we have seen that we\u2019re a very strong team.\u201d As in 2013-14, La Liga is coming down to the wire for Atl\u00e9tico; they are level on points with the leaders, Barcelona, with two matches to play. Two seasons ago, they had to play the Champions League final against Real seven days after the title decider at Barcelona. This time, there will be a two-week period between the end of the league season and the showpiece European final. Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s remaining games are against Levante (away) and Celta Vigo (home). Simeone senses opportunity. \u201cThere is another possibility for us to win the Champions League final,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last time, we had to play against Barcelona and then Real Madrid but now, we\u2019ve got a fortnight to prepare for the final. Of course, I\u2019m very, very happy and I don\u2019t think about avenging. These are new possibilities.\u201d"
"18||Labour battles to retain local power and build platform for 2020 campaign\u201cWe have aspirations to get Labour elected all over,\u201d Jeremy Corbyn declared as he launched the party\u2019s election campaign in Harlow, Essex, last month. His message was one of optimism and defiance, holding out the prospect of Labour gains on Thursday 5 May. But as polling day approaches, the party is claiming that a good night would be simply to avoid or limit the loss of councillors. Corbyn\u2019s aides claim their leader was misinterpreted when he said Labour was not going to lose seats. This picture is borne out by Labour campaigners on the ground, who fear that the prospect of regaining dominance in English councils outside the big cities could be a long way off. \u201cTo be perfectly frank, it\u2019s going to be very tight,\u201d said Jon Clempner, clad in a neon Labour vest as he knocked doors on Monday. As leader of the local authority in Harlow, Clempner is one of the few powerful Labour politicians in the southern counties, running a little island of red in a sea of Tory blue across Essex. The town has already decided it wanted a Conservative MP, electing Rob Halfon, the champion of so-called \u201cwhite van\u201d conservatism, in 2010 and again last year. And now, like voters in other postwar new towns created by Labour \u2013 Crawley, Milton Keynes and Stevenage \u2013 residents are weighing up a change at local level. Many Labour members who voted for Corbyn to become leader hope for a bounce in their party\u2019s popularity now that it has a distinctive anti-austerity message and has drawn a line under the New Labour era. But Clempner said he had not detected a \u201cseismic shift one way or the other since last year\u201d. The goal is to remind voters that they like the Labour council for keeping the street lights on, building affordable housing and dealing sensibly with public finances. \u201cWe are basically trying to pretend Europe and national politics doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Clempner said. This message was echoed by Emma Toal, the deputy leader of the council, who is battling to keep her marginal seat in Harlow Common. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had some new voters come to us but also we\u2019ve had some go to don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve got enough support here in Harlow Common to win, but the problem here \u2013 as at all local elections \u2013 is turnout. I honestly think a lot of people will vote the way they voted last year.\u201d She handed a leaflet to a resident cleaning his car in front of a neat 1950s terrace. What about Corbyn? \u201cHe doesn\u2019t say much, does he? But I\u2019m Labour whoever\u2019s leader,\u201d he said reassuringly. Not too many people had raised the antisemitism row of the past week, Toal said, but a couple of Jewish voters had got in touch with the local party to say they were unhappy. \u201cThey were upset about discrimination and I spent a while talking to them, and said there is no place for it in our party,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it has got through to the average person.\u201d The challenge for Labour to retain Harlow is repeated in Carlisle, Dudley, Bolton, Plymouth and Southampton, where the party needs to hold on to and consolidate its local power to boost its chances of getting into Downing Street in 2020. Nervousness in the north Corbyn\u2019s arrival in Carlisle on Monday night was pitched as a morale-boosting exercise for Labour\u2019s ground troops. But it was also a sign of nervousness that his party could be in danger of losing control of the council in England\u2019s most northerly city. Despite Carlisle being one of Labour\u2019s top target seats in last year\u2019s general election, the Conservative incumbent, John Stevenson, increased his majority by almost 2,000. Labour is understandably a little jittery about how it will do here on Thursday. Labour took control of Carlisle council in 2012 and currently has 28 councillors to the Conservatives\u2019 20. A loss of three seats would be enough to plunge the council into no overall control, and the Tories smell blood. They are heavily targeting two wards in the west of the city, Yewdale and Belle Vue, and hope that an Independent candidate can defeat Labour in Botcherby, a poor eastern suburb dominated by a big council estate. Addressing a members-only meeting in Yewdale, where Labour held off the Tories by 12 votes in a local byelection in 2015, Corbyn reportedly said: \u201cWe are doing very well; we have got a lot of people knocking on doors and a lot of people very angry at the budget.\u201d Corbyn didn\u2019t knock on any doors himself, but if he had, many voters here wouldn\u2019t have recognised him. Standing with her five-month-old baby on her hip outside her house on the Harraby estate, Samantha Lynn had just promised her vote to Anne Glendinning, Labour\u2019s candidate in Botcherby. Lynn, 31, said she\u2019d never voted before because she wasn\u2019t a \u201cpolitical person\u201d, but she thought Glendinning was nice and so would try to do so on Thursday, \u201c\u2018cos she\u2019s asked us to\u201d. Neither she nor her sister Steph, 25, had any idea who Jeremy Corbyn was. Glendinning admitted she was frustrated last week when the former London mayor Ken Livingstone\u2019s comments about Hitler dominated the news. \u201cSometimes I do wonder if they even know down in London we\u2019ve got local elections on. I think: why have you gone and done that? Are you trying to sabotage us?\u201d she said. And yet the antisemitism row had not yet featured on any of her door-knocking sessions. \u201cPeople are really interested in local issues. If we can solve the problem of dog muck we will be heroes,\u201d she said. Over in the Belah ward, in the north of the city, the Conservative councillor Gareth Ellis said local concerns were not party political: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen leftwing dog poo or a rightwing pothole,\u201d he said. David Morton, another Conservative, who was canvassing with his guide dog, Volley, was reluctant to say that Corbyn\u2019s leadership was a boon for the Conservatives \u2013 \u201cpeople keep telling me he\u2019s a liability for Labour, but we will see what happens\u201d. But many of his voters view Corbyn with distrust. Lewis Gill, 37, an IT worker, said he was a floating voter who had previously supported Labour but no longer trusted them with the economy. Jim Wainwright, a roofing contractor, said he had voted Labour before but wouldn\u2019t do so under Corbyn, whom he described as a \u201chypocrite of the highest order. He spent all those years voting against everything his own party proposed and now he\u2019s got power he wants everyone to go along with him.\u201d Waning union influence Back in Harlow town centre, few people in the main shopping plaza realised there was an election this week or had heard of Corbyn. An exception was 29-year-old Kevin Bolwerk, who had read some negative media stories about the Labour leader but wanted to make up his own mind based on the facts. He would probably vote Conservative, he said, \u201cbecause they have better policies for the business I\u2019m in\u201d. Along the high street, Bernie O\u2019Reilly, 85, and his neighbour, explained that Harlow used to be fiercely Labour because of strong trade union influence in the area, but that had ebbed away. A former Conservative voter, O\u2019Reilly was \u201cdefinitely Ukip\u201d for the local council elections and \u201cdefinitely out\u201d in the EU referendum, as he said Cameron looked like he wanted to be president of Europe. There is a similar story of a Labour council fighting to keep control in nearby Milton Keynes, according to Andrew Pakes, who ran as a Labour parliamentary candidate and failed to dislodge the town\u2019s Tory MP, Iain Stewart, last year. \u201cDespite the scale of the cuts in local government, in two years Labour has transformed the way Milton Keynes has been run,\u201d Pakes said. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept all the libraries open, we\u2019ve kept all the Sure Start centres open, we\u2019ve got the biggest council house building programme outside London, which are under threat because of the noise being created by the positions of Labour nationally. The challenge on the doorstep rarely is the performance of the council. That is the kind of space we are in. If Labour wins on Thursday in Milton Keynes, it will be because we\u2019ve got a bloody good council working hard. If we lose, it will in part be a reflection of Labour\u2019s positions nationally.\u201d If the party loses any councils, it will not just be a matter of hurt pride and disappointment among Labour campaigners for a second year in a row. MPs such as Ben Bradshaw, the former culture secretary, who has helped build a Labour stronghold in Exeter, said winning more council seats in swing areas was essential if Labour was to win the next election. \u201cWe managed to buck the trend in Exeter and treble our majority, but without the Milton Keyneses, the Harlows, the Swindons, the Strouds, the Gloucesters at parliamentary level, Labour can never win a majority ever again \u2013 particularly in light of what\u2019s happened in Scotland,\u201d Bradshaw said. \u201cWe need to be making massive advances in all of those southern England towns and cities if we are to be on course to win the next election.\u201d"
"1||Spain issues arrest warrants for Russian officials close to PutinSpain has issued arrest warrants for senior Russian government officials close to Vladimir Putin following a decade-long investigation into the activities of the Russian mafia. A Spanish national court judge is seeking to arrest 12 people allegedly linked to Russian gangsters operating in Spain. They include Vladislav Reznik, a prominent MP for Putin\u2019s ruling United Russia party, and Reznik\u2019s wife Diana Gindin. Also sought are Nikolai Aulov, the deputy head of Russia\u2019s federal narcotics service and Igor Sobelevsky, the former deputy head of the the prosecutor general\u2019s investigative committee, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Most of those wanted by Spain are believed to be in Russia. The high-placed officials are thought to have helped one of Russia\u2019s best-known mafia groups, the Tambov gang, infiltrate state structures, police, port authorities and private banks and corporations. The Tambov and Malyshev gangs, which made their names smuggling heroin in St Petersburg when Putin was deputy mayor in the 1990s, allegedly laundered money through Spanish real estate. They are also accused of murder, extortion and drugs and weapons trafficking. The arrest warrants were issued in January but only became public this week. The Spanish prosecutor\u2019s moves bolster longstanding allegations that the Russian government is a mafia state involved in corruption and organised crime. The reputed head of the Tambov gang, Gennady Petrov, has previously been tied to several of Putin\u2019s closest allies. In 1998-99 he was a co-owner of Bank Rossiya, along with several men who have homes with Putin in the Ozero dacha compound near St Petersburg. In 2014 the US sanctioned Bank Rossiya, describing it as the \u201cpersonal bank for senior (Russian) officials.\u201d Last month the Panama Papers revealed that managers at Bank Rossiya transferred at least $1bn to offshore firms linked to Sergei Roldugin, a professional musician and Putin\u2019s best friend. Roldugin owns 3.2% of the bank. \u201cThe criminal organisation headed by Petrov managed to achieve a clear penetration of the state structures of his country, not only with the lawmaker Reznik but with several ministers,\u201d the Spanish prosecutor\u2019s report said. In particular, Petrov allegedly paid investigative committee deputy head Sobolevsky\u2019s personal expenses and presented him with gifts in exchange for information about police actions against his gang. The Spanish court has reissued 2012 warrants for Petrov, his wife, and a supposed member of the Malyshev gang. The arrest warrants follow a major, multi-stage investigation by prosecutors and Spain\u2019s intelligence services into Russian mafia activity. Russian criminals began using Spain as a base of operations back in the mid-1990s. They laundered profits from illegal activities in Russia and invested them in Spanish real estate. In 2004 Spanish prosecutors created a formal strategy to \u201cbehead\u201d the Russian mafia. The Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, an expert on Russian organised crime, helped the police investigation. It was Litvinenko who, according to US diplomats, coined the phrase \u201cmafia state\u201d. A public inquiry last year into Litvinenko\u2019s murder heard that he was due to give evidence to Spanish prosecutors. A week before the meeting in 2006 he was murdered in London with radioactive polonium. Other senior Russian government officials not so far indicted feature in Spanish court papers. They include Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Dmitry Kozak, former prime minister Viktor Zubkov, and former defence minister Anatoly Serdyukov, Zubkov\u2019s son-in-law. Also mentioned is Leonid Reiman, a former communications minister. All are close to Putin. The most intriguing name is that of Aulov. The Spanish police collected thousands of hours of intercept material during their inquiry including 78 phone calls between Aulov and Petrov. Shortly before he was killed, Litvinenko wrote an unflattering report about Viktor Ivanov, Aulov\u2019s boss. An inquiry chaired by Sir Robert Owen found last year that the report had fallen into the Kremlin\u2019s hands and may have contributed to Litvinenko\u2019s murder. It is highly unlikely the Kremlin will allow the extradition of any of the wanted Russians to Spain. Russia\u2019s constitution forbids the extradition of its citizens. Putin has refused to extradite to the UK Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun \u2013 the two men found by the public inquiry to have poisoned Litvinenko. The Spanish prosecutor alleges that Reznik helped secure government positions inside Russia for the mafia\u2019s preferred candidates. One of them was Alexander Bastrykin, the boss of Russia\u2019s powerful investigative committee. In return, it is alleged, the mafia rewarded Reznik with money and property. Reznik denies wrongdoing and says his friendship with Petrov is purely social. Prosecutors have put out a warrant for Reznik through Interpol, a move that Reznik\u2019s lawyer said had been appealed. The federal narcotics service called the decision to arrest Aulov part of \u201ca political hit job to discredit Russian officials\u201d, RIA Novosti reported."
"3||Robert Peston 'not obsessed' with ratings for new showRobert Peston has said he doesn\u2019t feel underexposed at ITV and isn\u2019t overly concerned about the ratings for his new Sunday politics show. Peston is to debut his new politics show at 10am on Sunday as part of his move from the BBC to become ITV\u2019s politics editor. Asked on Radio 4\u2019s Media Show whether he missed the exposure after leaving the BBC, which consistently gets more viewers for news and current affairs programmes than its commercial rival, Peston said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel underexposed at ITV. I\u2019ve not sensed that, if the truth be told. People still seem to know I exist.\u201d He said ITV had told him they wanted a create a show to be proud of, rather than simply chasing ratings or becoming too concerned with shaping the news agenda. \u201cWe are not obsessed with ratings,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are obsessed with making a programme people are going to enjoy and feel is worthwhile. I do want people to watch it, but am I completely obsessed with Monday\u2019s headlines? No I am not. That said, I love trying to get scoops and I love trying to get news.\u201d Peston said he hoped to help his audience understand people such as public civil servants and politicians, saying his recently deceased father had instilled in him a belief that it was a good thing to \u201cdevote oneself to public service or life\u201d. Peston said: \u201cWhat I want to do is make politics and current affairs palpably relevant to people\u2019s lives and also try to do something about the sort of widespread cynicism about people who go into public life. They are exposing themselves to a lot of criticism but for not very much in the way of \u2013 compared to going into the city or business \u2013 financial reward, and I think we deserve to give those people a bit of a better hearing. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go soft on those people if we think they are making terrible mistakes but I think we have to give them a space where they can tell us more about who they are, why they are doing what they are doing, because if we are going to criticise them I think we have to understand them first.\u201d"
"1||Government U-turn on unaccompanied refugee children welcomed by MPsConservative MP Stephen Phillips and Labour MP Yvette Cooper welcomed the government\u2019s U-turn on offering sanctuary to unaccompanied refugee children, after meeting young refugee children in camps in Athens. As the government folded, in the face of mounting pressure, to accept more of the estimated 90,000 refugee children who are travelling through Europe alone, Cooper and Phillips spent the day meeting some of the most vulnerable migrants in Europe. They were at a UNHCR shelter for women and children in an abandoned Olympic hockey stadium, behind the runway of the disused Ellinikon airport, when David Cameron told MPs at prime minister\u2019s questions that he was going to accept a crucial amendment to the immigration bill. The U-turn will mean the UK can give homes to more unaccompanied refugee children, many of whom are currently living in poor conditions in camps such as the one in Athens. Phillips, who was one of a group of Conservative MPs preparing to rebel against the government\u2019s opposition to the Dubs amendment calling for more children to be given refuge in the UK, said he was delighted at the change in position. \u201cThe announcement from No 10 today will give these children hope after all they have suffered,\u201d he said, after touring the makeshift accommodation of donated tents set up inside the abandoned sports stadium, with blankets hung from the ceiling for privacy. More than 1,300 people are living in very basic conditions in the stadium; there are no schools for the children, and only very poor washing facilities and basic food supplies. \u201cI am thrilled that they are going to accept the amendment and that this will make a difference to some children in France and Italy and Greece. I think that it is in the best British tradition and what Britain has done in crises like this in the past. It demonstrates again that we are leading the way. The government has listened to us.\u201d Phillips had described this as the \u201cgreatest migration challenge since the second world war\u201d, and had been vocal in his opposition to the government\u2019s reluctance to accept more children. Cooper was also pleased that the decision made in London could have a positive impact on the lives of the children in the UNHCR camp. \u201cThere are 35 unaccompanied children here who have no proper shelter and are at risk. The ones who are most at risk aren\u2019t even in the camps or the shelters. There are so many children who are not in proper school, or in proper accommodation,\u201d she said. But she said campaigners needed to maintain pressure on the government to ensure that sanctuary was offered on a large scale. \u201cIt is a really big change in principle. We have been calling for Britain to take child refugees from within Europe in order to do our fair share for months. \u201cThis means for the first time they have accepted that Britain should be taking child refugees from camps like this and we should be doing our best to help children who are at risk of trafficking and abuse. We need to make sure that the government delivers on this. We need to keep up the pressure to make sure we help on the scale that we need to,\u201d she said. Giovanni Lepri, UNHCR\u2019s assistant representative in Athens, said as many as 300 unaccompanied migrant children were currently being held in detention centres in Greece because children\u2019s homes were overflowing. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough places for them. The government recognises this issue and is doing what it can. The last thing the government wants is to have these minors in a situation absolutely not suitable for them,\u201d he said. He welcomed the announcement from London, and was hopeful that it would begin to relieve the pressure on Greece. \u201cThe UNHCR is hoping that all European countries will make their policies as open as possible, particularly when it comes to children. In first place in our list of priorities is for the children to have a legal way to reach European countries, where they have longer-term prospects. Greece is making a remarkable effort, but it is evidently not capable of meeting the needs of everyone,\u201d he said. Earlier in the day, the MPs visited a former hotel in the suburbs of Athens that has been converted into a children\u2019s home. It currently houses around 65 children aged between seven and 17 who are fleeing conflict in Syria and Afghanistan, most of them travelling alone without their family. Staff told the MPs that some of the children had seen their parents die en route, some had been separated from them during the journey, while many did not know where their parents were. One of the youngest residents was a seven-year-old girl from Afghanistan, travelling with an older brother, hoping to join an uncle in Germany. \u201cThey all want affection. They always need a hug, particularly the seven- and eight-year-olds who are travelling alone. Staff try to avoid playing the role of a father or a mother; they are going to leave us so they shouldn\u2019t become too bonded to us; it is hard,\u201d said the centre\u2019s manager, Tomazina Tsaliki. \u201cThey are cheerful, but they worry about what they are going to do next, about their families.\u201d The former foyer of the hotel is thronging with children \u2013 running down the concrete steps, their flip-flops slapping on the floor, sitting next to each other on the sofas, waiting for something to happen. Some are in school in Athens, but many are taking basic language and maths classes. Children who are housed here get weekly counselling sessions to help them come to terms with what they have experienced over the past few months. Staff worry more about the children they cannot take in. The hotel is full and has to turn away requests to house more child refugees every day. \u201cAll the shelters for unaccompanied minors are full,\u201d Tsaliki said, adding that she did not know what happened to the children they were unable to accommodate."
"0||Why Trump v Clinton will be an unpopularity contestAfter Tuesday\u2019s Indiana primary, it seems inevitable that in the presidential election in November, Americans will choose between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. It wasn\u2019t always this way. Last summer, Trump was dismissed by some experts as \u201cnot a real candidate\u201d, with a 2% chance of winning his party\u2019s nomination. And although Clinton has been the Democratic frontrunner since announcing her bid in April 2015, that a former first lady is running at all is still no small surprise. The question now looming is which candidate can make it all the way to the White House. Making predictions about November in May may be asking for trouble, but by some metrics it looks like Trump\u2019s luck may have run out. When polls have asked voters to imagine a scenario in which they must choose between Trump and Clinton, most have said they would choose Clinton. Since May last year, 67 polls have pitted the two candidates against one another. In 58 such polls, respondents chose Clinton over Trump. Three polls found the two candidates tied and six gave Trump the win \u2013 on average by less than four percentage points. However, polling averages show the gap changing considerably. In July 2015 it was vast (Clinton by 20 percentage points); in January 2016 it was small (Clinton by three). Currently, there are 6.5 percentage points between the two. That gap will no doubt continue to change. Imagining who will lose the 8 November election is sometimes harder than imagining who will win. The primary season can warp perceptions. Candidates have a string of wins under their belts by the time they secure the nominations \u2013 in this case, Trump has won 28 states and Clinton 25. But those wins may not seem quite so glorious when you attempt to distinguish the popularity of winning candidates from the unpopularity of their rivals. Since June 2015, for example, more Americans have said they have an unfavourable opinion of Trump (on average 60%) than a favourable opinion (35%). Trump\u2019s unpopularity has been pretty consistent. Often, when he appears to catch Clinton in national polling, it\u2019s not so much about a Trump surge as a Clinton dip. And since November, similar polling for the former secretary of state has found that respondents are less inclined to say they have a favourable opinion of her. Clinton\u2019s falling popularity has been so steady that last month she was considered more unfavourable than favourable \u2013 just like Trump. That conclusion \u2013 that neither of the two candidates Americans will probably have to choose between are viewed favourably by the majority of those Americans \u2013 is important. It could affect turnout, especially if there is a particular lack of enthusiasm in one party. Turnout at primaries has been high \u2013 almost double that of 2012, according to Pew Research Center. Among Republicans, primary turnout has risen from 9.8% in 2012 to approximately 17.3%. Democratic turnout has increased from 6.3% to 11.7%, although four years ago the incumbent Barack Obama did not face a serious challenger. If Trump can convince more people to show up, he could close the gap. There is another thing Trump will have to do: win over voters who do not identify as Republican. There are a lot of them. The percentage of Americans who describe themselves as independent is at a record high: according to Gallup, which has conducted polls on voter identification since 1988, 42% of respondents say they are independent while 29% say they are Democratic and 26% Republican. Understanding the demographics of Trump\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s supporters can offer important clues about who they need to attract. A recent poll from CNN/ORC found that individuals who said Trump was their first choice for president were more likely to be male, white or older. Of those who described themselves as \u201cindependent\u201d, 42% said Trump was their first choice. When asked if they were \u201centhusiastic\u201d about the prospect of Trump being nominee, 32% of independents said they were and 33% said they were \u201csatisfied but not enthusiastic\u201d. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. When CNN/ORC conducted the poll, between 28 April and 1 May, they also asked those 1,001 adults (890 of whom were registered voters) about Clinton. Her supporters were more likely to be female, urban or have an income of more than $50,000 a year. Many such findings about Trump and Clinton supporters have been borne out by exit polling during the primary season. At this early stage of gazing into the crystal ball, a couple of things seem possible. Clinton will need to continue to appeal to women and older voters \u2013 not least because those groups are more likely to cast a ballot on election day. But the non-white vote will also become a more focused issue. When 31% of the US electorate is not white and there is only a 6% gap between candidates, it\u2019s clear how important such voters could be. Ultimately, though, there is only one thing Clinton needs to do to win the White House in November: make herself less unpopular than Trump."
"4||Fracking: environmental groups sue EPA in call for strict rules on wasteFrack waste has triggered earthquakes from Ohio to Oklahoma, and fouled rivers in Pennsylvania to North Dakota \u2013 and now the Obama administration is being sued by environmental groups to crack down on the industry. A coalition of environmental groups sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday to demand a strong uniform standard for the transportation, storage and disposal of frack waste. Since 1998, when the modern era of fracking began in Texas, the industry has generated hundreds of billions of gallons of frack waste \u2013 packed with toxic chemicals such as benzene and naturally occurring substances underground such as radium and arsenic \u2013 and there are almost no rules governing the process, environmental groups said. \u201cUpdated rules for oil and gas wastes are almost 30 years overdue,\u201d said Adam Kron, senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project. With the lawsuit, environmental groups hope to push the EPA to adopt strict national standards for frack water storage and disposal \u2013 starting with firm limits on wastewater injection wells. US Geological Survey scientists and independent researchers have found a sharp rise in seismic activity in states such as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and connected those tremors to high volumes of frack waste in disposal wells. A single well near Youngstown, Ohio, was linked to 77 earthquakes. Arkansas, Colorado and New Mexico have also experienced a spike in earthquakes, because of high-volume wastewater injection wells. \u201cIf the injection of vast gallons of this waste is leading to increased danger of earthquakes, that is certainly reasonable for the EPA to step in and try and do something about it,\u201d Kron said. The suit also hopes to push the EPA to require the industry to install liners on wastewater ponds to prevent spills such as the 2012 breach of a 6m-gallon holding pond in Pennsylvania, which fouled a trout stream, and improve pipeline maintenance. Last year, 3m gallons of drilling waste spilled into a tributary of the Missouri river from a leaky pipe near the town of Williston, North Dakota. The groups were also seeking a ban on the practice of slopping frack waste across roads, as a de-icing agent, or on to fields and stricter controls on dumping waste on landfills. The groups filing the suit include the Environmental Integrity Project, Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthworks, Responsible Drilling Alliance, San Juan Citizens Alliance, West Virginia Surface Owners\u2019 Rights Organization and the Center for Health, Environment and Justice. At the heart of the problem are the vast amounts of wastewater generated by fracking. It can take up to 6m gallons of water, sand and chemicals pumped into the ground at high pressure to flush out oil and gas from the rock formations for a single well. Almost all of that water comes back up again in the form of waste \u2013 and there are an estimated 1.7m active oil and gas wells in the US, according to the voluntary disclosure site FracTracker. In 2012, Environment America, which is not involved with the lawsuit, estimated the waste generated by the oil and gas industry in a single year was enough to flood all of Washington DC beneath a 22ft-deep toxic lagoon."

"23||Keeping up with the Kommunists: the Kardashians head for CubaMore than 500 years after Khristopher Kolumbus and his entourage arrived on Cuba to film the little-watched reality show Keeping Up with the Konquistadors, the island is about to experience another seismic twist in its turbulent history. According to reports, Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian are heading to Cuba, which may leave the Cuban people wondering if the recent rapprochement with the US is really all that. Cuba isn\u2019t an obvious choice for the Kardashians. It\u2019s not great for shopping, what with the trade embargo, and the family may find it tricky to update their Instagram accounts with Cuba\u2019s restricted internet access (one expects they\u2019ll find a way). So, what can we expect from the Kardashians\u2019 trip, as seen through their various media channels? The three of them perched on a mint-green 1950s Chevy, obviously. A selfie in front of a Che Guevara mural (\u201c#Our every action is a battle cry against imperialism [heart emoji] [smiley face]\u201d)? On previous international missions, the Kardashians have raised awareness of a historic massacre (\u201cToday marks the 100 year anniversary of Armenian Genocide!\u201d) and paid a charitable visit to an orphanage in Thailand (\u201cI told Kanye I was like, honestly, this girl is so sweet and so cute, like, I would totally adopt her,\u201d said Kim on the Kardashians\u2019 reality show). Kim, in particular, is comfortable with talks with world leaders; she met the Armenian prime minister during her trip there last year. Here\u2019s hoping she gets to meet Fidel Castro, so the world can have a lasting record of his feelings about the world\u2019s foremost reality star and one of the most influential women in the world. We haven\u2019t heard much about his opinions on celebs since Naomi Campbell reported that the former leader had complimented her on becoming the first black model to appear on the cover of Vogue and said he was impressed that Kate Moss had \u201cstarted the revolution of little models\u201d. I know, it\u2019s like when Guevara took Havana. \u201cI suppose we were both revolutionaries in his eyes,\u201d Campbell added. Pray that Kastro delivers."
"2||BHP Billiton faces \u00a330bn compensation claim over Brazil dam disasterThe mining group BHP Billiton and its partner Vale are facing a 155bn reais (\u00a330bn) claim from Brazilian prosecutors over an iron ore mine dam collapse last year that released a torrent of toxic mud, killing 19 people and leaving 700 homeless. Shares in the London-listed BHP plunged almost 10% after the charges were revealed into what is being called Brazil\u2019s worst ever environmental disaster. They closed down nearly 6%. The damages claim has been based on the clean-up costs of BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon accident in the US, say federal prosecutors in Minas Gerais, south-east Brazil, where the two companies\u2019 joint mining venture, Samarco, is based. \u201cPreliminary studies show the human, economic and socio-environmental impacts of the collapse of the dam are, at least, equivalent to those verified in the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d they said. \u201cIt does not seem credible, neither technically nor morally, that the value of the human, cultural and physical environment in Brazil should be worth less than other countries,\u201d they added in a statement. BHP said it had not yet received any formal notice of the legal claim but \u201cremains committed to helping Samarco to rebuild the community and restore the environment affected by the failure of the dam\u201d. The Melbourne-based company said a separate lawsuit, which Samarco, Vale and BHP settled with the Brazilian government in March, in which the companies would pay an estimated 20bn reais, was the best way to repair damage caused by the spill. \u201cWe believe that the agreement (once approved by the court) provides the long-term remedial and compensation framework for responding to the impact of the Samarco tragedy and the appropriate platform for the parties to work together,\u201d BHP said. That unusually quick deal was praised by President Dilma Rousseff but Brazil\u2019s political climate is turbulent, with Rousseff fighting off a potential impeachment over a completely unrelated bribery scandal. Paul Gait, a senior analyst at Bernstein Investment Research in London, told Reuters the case was politically motivated, with prosecutors wanting to raise the pressure on Rousseff. \u201cThey\u2019re implying she had radically undersold the Brazilian people and was in the pockets of business,\u201d he said. Financial analysts see no reason to use BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon accident as a benchmark for claims as the cases are quite different but it puts the pressure on BHP given BP has so far handed over US$50bn (\u00a335bn). Mining operations have been suspended since the dam burst triggered a tide of mud which buried the village of Bento Rodrigues and swept down the Doce river. The dam was holding \u201ctailings\u201d, a mining waste product of metal filings, dirty water and possibly chemicals. The yellow brown waste travelled 300 miles downstream before cascading into the Atlantic Ocean and threatening beaches. Izabella Teixeira, the environment minister, told the newspaper O Globo that it could take decades for the natural environment to be fully repaired. \u201cIt\u2019s clear what happened in the Doce river is the biggest environmental catastrophe in this country\u2019s history. We can\u2019t let it happen again. Our current environmental laws are insufficient to deal with an accident of this kind.\u201d Brazilian prosecutors have a reputation for demanding very high compensation payments, although settlements are sometimes agreed at a much lower cost later on \u2013 as was the case with US group Chevron in 2011. That involved an oil spill off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and led to a \u00a312bn claim being lodged but the case was settled three years later for less than \u00a330m. Prosecutors have demanded that BHP, Vale and Samarco put 7.7bn reais into an independently managed fund within 30 days. They have promised to bring in an independent team to assess what the full financial claim should be. Samarco is trying to bring the mine back into operation as quickly as possible but a state environment officer has demanded it should not happen until the company can show pollution has ended. BHP is already struggling with a collapse in its profits as it struggles to cope with rock bottom iron ore, coal and oil prices. In February the group reported a half-year net loss of $5.67bn (\u00a34bn), its first deficit in 16 years."

"1||Noshir Wadia obituaryOur former teacher Noshir Wadia, known to us as \u201cProf\u201d, who has died aged 91, was a pioneering figure in Indian neurology. He was born in Surat, Gujarat, one of five children of Hormusji, a timber merchant, and his wife, Dinamai. He attended St Xavier\u2019s school and obtained his medical qualification from the Grant Medical College in Mumbai (then Bombay). In 1951, after completing an MD, he travelled to the UK to train in neurology, spending four formative years as registrar to the pioneering neurologist Lord (Russell) Brain at the London hospital. At the age of 32, he became honorary neurologist to the JJ hospital and Grant College, Mumbai, with a mandate to establish the first neurology department in India. What started with six beds had grown into a 45-bed neurology department with a formidable reputation by the time he retired in 1982. In 1973, while still at the JJ, he also set up a neurology department at the Jaslok, a private hospital recognised for its postgraduate training. He was a keen observer and a careful researcher. When he returned to India he noticed that the prevalence of neurological diseases was different from those in the standard textbooks. He felt that Indian neurologists should identify and document the prevalence of local diseases. His studies ranged from the neurological complications of manganese poisoning in Indian miners, to the high Indian prevalence of craniovertebral anomalies, Wilson\u2019s disease, tuberculosis presenting primarily as spinal meningitis, and nutritional disorders of the nervous system. He identified two unique Indian diseases later recognised elsewhere - a new variant of hereditary ataxia with slow eye movements, and adult poliomyelitis due to a new virus (Enterovirus 70) associated with conjunctivitis. Prof was also responsible for training a generation of neurologists. His \u201cboys and girls\u201d are now scattered around the world. His skill in clinical neurology was matched by his flair for teaching and bringing the subject alive. He was a charming, humble man with a quick smile and always had a kind word. He forged lifelong friendships with many British neurologists. Some of them regularly visited his unit in Mumbai. He also served the World Federation of Neurology through several of its committees and research groups, finally being elected vice-president. He received many national and international awards, including the Padma Bhushan, India\u2019s third highest civilian award, in 2012. He is survived by his wife, Piroja, a pioneer of clinical neurophysiology in India, by two stepsons, and by two brothers."
"15||Why must the Trump alternative be self-satisfied, complacent Democrats?The year of our discontent rolls on, and now it is Indiana that hands victory to the insurgent senator Bernie Sanders and the protectionist demagogue Donald Trump. Seven years have passed now since the last recession officially ended, and yet the country\u2019s fury has scarcely cooled. To this day we remain angry at Wall Street; we rage against career politicians; and we are incandescent that the economic system seems to have been permanently \u201crigged\u201d against working people. Median household income has still not recovered the levels of 2007. Wages are going nowhere. Elite bankers are probably never going to be held accountable for what they did. America is burning. Listening to the leading figures of the Democratic party establishment, however, you\u2019d never know it. Cool contentment is the governing emotion in these circles. What they have in mind for 2016 is what we might call a campaign of militant complacency. They are dissociated from the mood of the nation, and they do not care. I mean this in ways both great and small. The party\u2019s leadership is largely drawn from a satisfied cohort that has done quite well in the aftermath of the Great Recession. They\u2019ve got a good thing going. Convinced that the country\u2019s ongoing demographic shifts will bring Democratic victory for years to come, they seem to believe the party\u2019s candidates need do nothing differently to harvest future electoral bumper crops. The seeds are already planted. All that is required is patience. Hillary Clinton is more or less openly offering herself as the complacency candidate. The least inspiring frontrunner in many years, she is a dynastic heir who stands to receive the Democratic nomination largely because it\u2019s her turn \u2013 the logic that made Bob Dole the GOP leader in 1996. Clinton has scolded her rival for wanting to break up Wall Street banks since such a policy, by itself, would not also end racism and sexism. (In point of fact, the black middle class was disproportionately damaged by the detonation of the housing bubble.) Clinton\u2019s unofficial slogan, \u201cAmerica never stopped being great\u201d \u2014 supposedly a searing riposte to Trump\u2019s \u201cmake America great again\u201d \u2013 sounds like the kind of thing you\u2019d see inscribed in a country club logo. In her words, we can hear the call of contentment, a would-be catchphrase for a generation of satisfied people. Barack Obama offered his own variation on the complacency theme during a meeting in March, in which he announced: \u201cAmerica\u2019s pretty darn great right now.\u201d Unemployment was down from the awful heights of a few years prior, the president reported, and businesses were hiring. Any residual economic complaints, he suggested, arose from \u201can alternative reality . . . that America\u2019s down in the dumps\u201d. Obama has said similar things often in these waning months of his presidency. In a recent interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times, he went even farther, brushing off criticism of his administration as cranky griping by people who had been left behind by history. He had helped institute \u201chard changes\u201d, he recollected, that made the economy more \u201cnimble\u201d and \u201cdynamic\u201d. Unfortunately, he continued: [T]hat then feeds, both on the left and the right, a temptation to say, \u2018If we could just go back to an era in which our borders were closed,\u2019 or, \u2018If we could just go back to a time when everybody had a defined-benefit plan,\u2019 or ,\u2018We could just go back to a time when there wasn\u2019t any immigrant that was taking my job, things would be OK.\u2019 Perhaps you noticed something peculiar about that statement, reader: that Obama has here lumped together two complaints that sound absurd and vaguely racist with a third impulse \u2013 a longing for defined-benefit pension plans \u2013 that is legitimate and quite real. As it happens, we know who wants to get everybody into a defined-benefit pension plan: organized labor, a big Democratic constituency for whom such plans, in which benefits do not fluctuate like stocks, are a common demand. Social security is another example of such a plan. Defined-benefit plans really exist. Millions of people count on them as a bulwark of middle-class security. Yes, Republicans have attacked defined-benefit plans for years, and such plans have become increasingly rare for younger workers, but instead of fighting back, here\u2019s our liberal president brushing it all off as pie-in-the-sky whining by soreheads. This is the flip side to the complacency chorus: resentment of people who can\u2019t see that all the skies are blue in our nimble and dynamic world. In Monday\u2019s New York Times, for example, columnist Charles Blow scolded those who believe that \u201clife in America has gotten worse . . . compared with 50 years ago\u201d, suggesting that such a view was associated with an \u201cimplicit, or even explicit, critique\u201d of the achievements of the Obama administration. He continued: \u201cThis view of the Obama presidency as, at best, a disappointment, or at worst, a failure, is a pernicious and unsupportable lie that did quite a bit to sour minorities on Sanders and to rally opposition to Trump.\u201d In reality, Donald Trump is a bigot of such pungent vileness that the victory of the Democratic candidate this fall is virtually assured. Absent some terrorist attack ... or some FBI action on the Clinton email scandal ... or some outrageous act of reasonableness by Trump himself, the blowhard is going to lose. This, in turn, frees the Democratic leadership to do whatever they want, to cast themselves in any role they choose. They do not need to move to \u201cthe center\u201d this time. They do not need to come up with some ingenious way to get Wall Street off the hook. They do not need to beat up on working people\u2019s organizations. That they seem to want to do all these things anyway tells us everything we need to know about who they really are: a party of the high-achieving professional class that is always looking for a way to dismiss the economic concerns of ordinary people.

"2||MPs examining BHS offer to cooperate with investigatorsMPs looking into the demise of BHS have written to the insolvency regulator and the Serious Fraud Office offering to cooperate with their investigations. Frank Field, chairman of the work and pensions committee, told the SFO boss, David Green, that MPs wanted to \u201cshed light on what has happened to BHS and identify any regulatory, supervisory or legislative deficiencies\u201d with regard to pensions. He asked the SFO to advise if there were any concerns about MPs\u2019 activity and if they might hinder \u201cany future criminal prosecutions\u201d. The SFO is understood to be conducting preliminary inquiries into the activities of the group of entrepreneurs led by the former racing driver Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS for \u00a31 a year ago. Less than a fortnight after it appointed administrators, BHS is already the subject of at least three inquiries, including an Insolvency Service investigation launched by the business secretary, Sajid Javid, on Tuesday and two by committees of MPs. The SFO has not confirmed or denied that it has begun an inquiry. Field also wrote to the Insolvency Service asking to be advised if its chief executive, Sarah Albon, had any concerns about the work and pensions committee\u2019s investigation. Javid asked the Insolvency Service to bring forward its investigation into BHS, urging the watchdog to consider the extent to which the conduct of the BHS directors led to its collapse into insolvency last week, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. The investigation will not only look at the role of the directors at the time when administrators were called in, led by Chappell of Retail Acquisitions, but their predecessors, led by Sir Philip Green. The Insolvency Service normally waits for the conclusion of a final report by administrators before commencing any investigation into a company \u2013 a process likely to take three months. But the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d surrounding the BHS case meant Javid wanted to commence the investigation as soon as possible. The work and pensions committee inquiry will begin on Monday with evidence from the pensions regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, the industry-backed body that is likely to have to make up BHS\u2019s pension deficit of \u00a3571m. On Tuesday, Green agreed to appear before an unusual joint session of the business, innovation and skills select committee and the work and pensions select committee. He is expected to go to parliament in mid-June after the committees have taken evidence from other parties, including Chappell and the BHS pension trustees. However, the committees said they had no plans to call Green\u2019s wife, Tina, who was the ultimate owner of BHS, to appear. Retail Acquisitions extracted more than \u00a325m of payments, including professional fees and loan interest, from BHS in the year before it entered administration with debts of \u00a31.3bn. The Guardian has revealed that Chappell could be forced to return millions of pounds paid to his consortium during its controversial 13-month ownership of BHS. The legal director of BHS has written to Chappell asking him for \u00a350,000 that was not repaid after he moved \u00a31.5m from the retailer to an obscure corporate vehicle in the days before its collapse. Meanwhile, administrators are examining whether loans paid to Retail Acquisitions can be called in. Under Green\u2019s stewardship, more than \u00a3586m was extracted in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans by the Green family and other shareholders, including The Ivy restaurant owner, Richard Caring. Green has faced calls to give up his knighthood following BHS\u2019s demise."
"4||US ceases efforts to end global trade of polar bear partsThe US government has quietly dropped its campaign for an international ban in the trade of polar bear parts, which would have given the practice the same outlaw status as the elephant ivory market. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has spent several years attempting to ban the overseas trade of polar bear skins, teeth, paws and other parts from Canada, which permits the hunting of the Arctic predators. However, the federal agency has said it won\u2019t pursue the matter further at an international summit of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites), in September. Instead, the US will focus on the threat posed to polar bears from climate change. \u201cThough we remain concerned about the commercial use of polar bear hides as an additional threat to the species, we are not pursuing increased Cites protections at this time,\u201d the USFWS said in a statement. \u201cWe are putting our resources into working in collaboration with other polar bear range states to address climate change and mitigate its impacts on the polar bear as the overwhelming threat to the long-term future of the species.\u201d The US\u2019s bid to ban the polar bear trade has garnered support from the UK, Germany and Russia but has been opposed by Canada, which insists that hunting is sustainable and an important cultural practice of the native Inuit people. Hunting can also generate income for communities, with tourists paying up to $50,000 for the chance to shoot a polar bear. The parts from more than 400 polar bears were traded in 2013. Polar bears are the world\u2019s largest species of bear, with males weighing around 500kg (1,100lb). About 16,000 of the world\u2019s 25,000 polar bears live in Canada. Inuit would have been banned from selling paws and teeth of polar bears internationally, even after the rest of the animal had been butchered and eaten, under any Cites ban. The Canadian government has previously lobbied the US to drop its opposition to the trade. Natan Obed, head of the national Inuit group Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, said: \u201cThis is a very good thing for Inuit. It\u2019s great to see that other countries are taking a step back and respecting science on the issue rather than other interests that have more to do with people\u2019s perception.\u201d However, environmental groups have strongly supported a ban, warning that hunting polar bears is putting further pressure on a species that is already on the frontline of climate change. The National Resources Defense Council said climate change, hunting and oil drilling is \u201cdriving the world\u2019s polar bears to the brink of extinction\u201d. The US government has protected the polar bear as an endangered species and recently saw off a court challenge that would have opened up prime polar bear habitat for fossil fuel exploitation in Alaska. Scientists have warned that there is \u201chigh probability\u201d that polar bears will suffer a 30% slump in numbers by 2050 due to climate change. The species is suffering from the melting of Arctic ice, which makes it difficult for the animals to hunt for prey such as seals. A recent study showed that the world\u2019s southernmost polar bears have experienced significant weight loss since the 1980s due melting ice, with males dropping, on average by 45kg (99lb) and females by 31kg."
"0||John Kasich quits Republican race, leaving Trump last man standingJohn Kasich formally suspended his presidential campaign on Wednesday, paving the way for Donald Trump to clinch the Republican nomination with a personal concession speech that barely touched on the political maelstrom his decision unleashes. The Ohio governor was the last of 16 candidates to see their ambitions blown away by Trump\u2019s unconventional entry into the presidential race, but he went quietly and with little of the drama that has marked earlier exits by other rivals. \u201cI have always said that the Lord has a purpose for me as he has for everyone, and as I suspend my campaign today I have renewed faith, deeper faith, that the Lord will show me the way forward and fulfill the purpose of my life,\u201d Kasich told supporters at a hastily arranged event in Columbus. \u201cThank you and God bless.\u201d The former House budget chairman and Lehman Brothers executive hinted at his belief in a softer, gentler style of politics, but pointedly did not mention Trump, nor whether he would support him as the party nominee. \u201cThe people of our country changed me,\u201d he said, recalling campaign highlights in New Hampshire and Ohio, and thanking his family. \u201cWe never had all the money wanted \u2013 we were probably outspent by 50:1 \u2013 but we did the best we could,\u201d he added, in the closest the 15-minute address got to a postmortem. His decision to suspend his campaign marks the formal end of the most extraordinary race for the Republican presidential nomination in modern political history, and leaves Trump with only the Democratic nominee \u2013 likely to be Hillary Clinton \u2013 standing between him and the White House in November\u2019s general election. In his first sitdown interview as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump immediately waded back into controversy, refusing to back down from his longstanding \u2013 and long-since debunked \u2013 claims that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, and also refusing to denounce antisemitic attacks on a journalist who wrote a profile about his wife. CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer asked Trump specifically to address his supporters who had sent \u201cvicious\u201d messages to journalist Julia Ioffe this week. After her profile of Donald Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, appeared in this month\u2019s issue of GQ, the Russian-American journalist received a torrent of antisemitic and threatening messages from supporters of the Republican frontrunner. \u201cI don\u2019t have a message to the fans \u2013 I\u2019m not gonna talk about that,\u201d Trump said, calling Ioffe\u2019s story \u201cnasty\u201d and defending his wife against unspecified falsehoods in the piece. When Blitzer asked Trump about his past support of \u201cbirtherism\u201d \u2013 the fervent and unsubstantiated belief that Obama was secretly born outside the United States and is therefore constitutionally ineligible for the presidency, Trump pinned his past statements on his likely opponent in the general election: Hillary Clinton. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who started it,\u201d Trump said. The billionaire has long argued that the former secretary of state was the instigator in the birther movement, although evidence for this assertion has not surfaced. Trump, whose senior campaign staff have intimated to Republican party leadership that the candidate would moderate his tone in the general election, also refused to walk back statements on other hot-button issues, including his signature proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigration into the United States. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I mean, look, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump said, when Blitzer asked if such a proposal would alienate America\u2019s allies in the Middle East. \u201cThe migration is a disaster \u2013 we\u2019re letting in thousands of people. They don\u2019t have documentation, they don\u2019t have paperwork, we don\u2019t know who they are or where they come from.\u201d In an interview with the New York Times Trump said he would implement the ban within his first 100 days, the paper reported. Arduous path John Kasich spent 18 years in Congress, including six years as chairman of the powerful House budget committee, before leaving government temporarily to work as a regional director for failed investment bank Lehman Brothers. He was elected governor of Ohio in 2010 in a close race with an incumbent Democrat and enjoyed home-state popularity measured at record levels in 2015, with 62% of Ohio voters approving of his job performance. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Ohio Democratic party said: \u201cSince last March, Governor John Kasich has spent more than 200 days out of state, pursuing his presidential ambitions and ignoring the needs of the people of Ohio \u2026 It\u2019s time that Ohio had a governor who was actually doing something about all of that, rather than gallivanting across the country.\u201d From the outset, Kasich faced an arduous path to the presidency. He came in near the bottom of the pack in Iowa\u2019s first in the nation caucus, polling at less than 2%. He staked his hopes to New Hampshire, where he spent weeks barnstorming the tiny New England state. In its endorsement of the governor, the New York Times editorial board called him the \u201conly plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race\u201d. Kasich celebrated his second-place finish in New Hampshire as if it were a win, and Trump had not clinched an overwhelming victory. Then he pivoted to Super Tuesday, where he eked out second-place finishes in Massachusetts and Vermont. Then, like Florida senator Marco Rubio, he tied his presidential ambitions to winning his home state. By the time Kasich declared victory at a party in Cleveland, his campaign had already conceded that it could not amass enough delegates to clinch the nomination outright. His campaign strategy was to complicate the delegate math and deny Trump the nomination, giving him the opportunity to emerge at a contested convention in Cleveland this summer. He struck an uneasy alliance with Ted Cruz, but that foundered after the Texas senator failed to win Indiana, which Kasich had agreed not to contest. Kasich was expected to perform well in the next several contests. In the end he leaves the race having won only one state and having amassed fewer delegates than Rubio, who exited in March after losing Florida. On the stump Kasich portrayed himself as a \u201chappy warrior\u201d, in contrast to Trump and his visceral appeal. He appeared alongside a ticking debt clock, reminding voters that he balanced the national budget in 1997 and was ready to do it again. He was prone to share anecdotes from his childhood, and admitted to being overcome by emotion when he decided to run for president, the son of a mailman seeking the highest office in the nation. In an effort to appeal to New Yorkers, the midwesterner embarked on a culinary tour, scarfing down pizza, pickles, pasta and pastrami \u2013 and on one occasion all in the same meal, attracting scorn from Trump, who said: \u201cI have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.\u201d Though he could be awkward in his delivery, and upset some over a comment that women in the 1970s had \u201cleft their kitchens\u201d to campaign for him, he also came across as gentle and compassionate. He appeared to try to genuinely connect with voters and often said that he enjoyed the intimacy of town hall events. In South Carolina, Kasich walked over and embraced a tearful young man who shared a personal story about overcoming hardship. But the governor was derided by Democrats for his staunch opposition to abortion and Planned Parenthood. In Ohio, he supported measures to defund the women\u2019s health organization. Some senior Republican officials saw something they liked: the contrast that Kasich, a methodical centrist with a long track record, drew with Trump and with Cruz, who dropped out of the race after his loss in Indiana on Tuesday night. But he failed to gain traction in a year dominated by Trump\u2019s unorthodox candidacy."
"0||Who will be Donald Trump's running mate? Here are five optionsWith Donald Trump as the Republican party\u2019s presumptive nominee, it\u2019s time for him to start contemplating a running mate. Here are five options for the veep stakes for the outsider who has often said he would look for a number two with political experience: Chris Christie Christie\u2019s endorsement of Trump was a pivotal moment for the campaign. But while the New Jersey governor has been a helpful and loyal surrogate, he doesn\u2019t add any geographic balance or conservative credentials. Plus, the footage of Christie standing behind Trump looking like a hostage on Super Tuesday doesn\u2019t help. Newt Gingrich The former House speaker and 2012 presidential hopeful has long been a rare pro-Trump voice in Washington DC. Gingrich would bring considerable political experience and significant public profile as a running mate. It\u2019s just a question of whether Trump wants to double down on a ticket of thrice-married elderly men who love publicity. Mike Huckabee The former Arkansas governor and two-time presidential candidate has long been perceived as supportive of Trump. His daughter is a top political aide on the Trump campaign. While many fiscal conservatives view Huckabee warily, he has a solid social conservative thread and a folksy charm that would pair well with Trump\u2019s big city bluster. It would just mean Huckabee would have to yet again give up a lucrative contract with Fox News for uncertain prospects on the campaign trail. Mary Fallin The Oklahoma governor has reportedly expressed a willingness to be considered as Trump\u2019s running mate and the presumptive nominee praised her as possibility. A two-term governor of the Sooner State who previously served in Congress, her selection would allow Trump to have a woman with significant government experience on the ticket. However, she is best known in Oklahoma for her push to carry out death sentences despite court orders to the contrary. Joni Ernst The gun-totin\u2019, Harley-ridin\u2019, pig castratin\u2019 Iowa farm girl burst on to the scene when she won the Iowa Senate race in 2014. Ernst has shown no willingness to embrace Trump, but the 45-year-old first-term female senator would be an ideal running mate for any Republican. Ernst is an Iraq veteran who won in a swing state. And as her notorious campaign ad proved, she already has the Trumpian flair."
"25||Patrick George obituaryPatrick George, who has died aged 92, was a landscape and figure painter of distilled emotion and intelligence who enjoyed a greater reputation among fellow artists than with the general public. A modest man of considered opinions and dry humour, he preferred to paint at his Suffolk home rather than court the art establishment, and his visits to London were mostly made in order either to teach or to see exhibitions of other artists\u2019 work. He eschewed self-promotion, yet his paintings are much cherished by a growing band of admirers who appreciate the formal toughness, unusual structures and sensitive colours of his subtle approach. Chief among his artist supporters is Frank Auerbach, who has described George\u2019s painting as having \u201cthe tension of a tightrope walker. I find it engrossing and admirable.\u201d Although, in recent years, George exhibited his work regularly at the Cork Street dealers Browse &amp; Darby, and enjoyed a major retrospective in 1980 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, he was already over 50 before he was given his first one-man show, in 1975, at Gainsborough\u2019s House, in Sudbury, Suffolk. In many respects, he was one of the art world\u2019s best-kept secrets, and it was only with the publication of a monograph on his work in 2014 that he became somewhat better known. George was born in Wilmslow, near Manchester, the only boy and middle child of three. His parents, Nora (nee Richards) and Alfred, moved with the family to a dairy farm in Gloucestershire when Patrick was 10, after Alfred had sold his successful dye-stuffs business to industrial competitors. Alfred applied his scientific approach to farming, ploughing up and replanting the fields to increase yield. Both Patrick\u2019s sisters inherited the scientific mentality: Wilma, the older one, becoming a geneticist, and Betsy, the younger, a botanist. His parents hoped that Patrick would take over the farm, but he had other ideas, nurtured by a liberal education. Aged seven, he was sent to the Downs at Colwall in Herefordshire (the Quaker prep school for Malvern college), where he came under the influence of an inspirational art master, Maurice Feild. With Feild\u2019s encouragement, George flourished, first exhibiting his paintings publicly at the age of 14. He also encountered William Coldstream, who had arrived at the Downs to paint the portrait of the school\u2019s English teacher, WH Auden. At this point, George was more interested in painting tugboats and locomotives, but when he discovered that Coldstream also painted trains, he was converted to the idea of being an artist. This ambition survived the uninspiring art teaching at his next school, Bryanston, where he and a fellow pupil, Lucian Freud, founded the oil painting club. In the ensuing competition for best painting, Freud came first and George second, a result that helped to propel him into applying to study art seriously. He was at Edinburgh School of Art for only a year before volunteering for the Royal Naval Reserve in 1942. George served with distinction and bravery for four years, first on a destroyer patrolling the Channel, then in landing craft at the D-day landings, and finally on a gun ship in the re-conquest of Burma. He continued to draw whenever he could, mostly on deck in sun or heavy seas. Demobbed, he made use of an ex-serviceman\u2019s grant to renew his painting studies, this time at Camberwell School of Art in 1946, where Coldstream was teaching. By now rather too experienced for art school, George and a group of like-minded friends set up house near Waterloo Station, where they painted each other and views of the city. In 1949, he joined the staff of the Slade School of Art, where Coldstream had just been appointed professor. The following year George settled in a house in Pimlico which would be his London base for the next half-century. In 1958, growing restless at the Slade, he applied for a job in Africa \u2013 teaching at the Nigerian College of Art, Science and Technology in Zaria. Although it resulted in some memorable landscape paintings and portraits, this was not a happy interlude, and George came back to the UK at the end of 1959. In 1961 he returned to teach at the Slade and remained there until his retirement in 1988, by which time he was Slade professor and director of the school. He is remembered with great affection as a teacher, for his generosity of response, his interest in work quite unlike his own, and his encouragement of risk-taking in pursuit of the truth. He is most frequently associated with the Euston Road school of realist painting founded by Coldstream, but he was also a member of the more international School of London, exhibiting with Michael Andrews, Francis Bacon, Leon Kossoff and Euan Uglow. Uglow, his erstwhile pupil, was perhaps his closest friend and colleague, whose own form of heightened realism began to attract more attention than did George\u2019s. Although they were never rivals, it could be said that Uglow stole some of George\u2019s thunder. But for those prepared to seek out George\u2019s paintings, there was much to reward them. A master of portraits and figure paintings, he was also adept at still-life painting, which he practised at home in Suffolk when the weather was too inclement to paint in the open air, or when he was at his London studio. George became famous for his polar explorer\u2019s gear, which enabled him to paint outside in most weathers, but above all he was celebrated for his devotion to the particularity of things, especially trees, and English light and atmosphere, and his ability to render all this most beautifully and memorably into the language of paint. In later years he read Montaigne to help prepare himself for death, but lost none of his relish for life, continuing to paint until a few weeks ago, and regularly enjoying roast lamb, good wine and whisky. His later work was looser in application but none the less effective for this. He was twice divorced. His final years were shared by the painter Susan Engledow, a friend for more than half a century. She survives him, along with the four daughters, Kate, Alice, Victoria and Nancy, of his first marriage, to June Griffith. \u2022 Patrick Herbert George, artist, born 28 July 1923; died 23 April 2016"
"24||Call to make recruiters responsible for housing migrant workers safelyGovernment anti-slavery bodies have pointed to a \u201cgap\u201d in the law that lets employment agencies who take on migrant workers avoid responsibility for helping them find safe housing. The call comes after it emerged that workers crammed into a dangerous disused showroom in north Wales had been suggested the accommodation by one of the UK\u2019s biggest employment agencies. More than 100 people who picked leeks and daffodils for Tesco and Waitrose were found living in the property in Flintshire, Hyperion House, when it was raided by the local council last year. Enforcement officers found 107 people living in 32 rooms, sharing three kitchens, six toilets and six showers in a property with broken smoke alarms and an overflowing septic tank. The landlord, John Russell Brown, was charging workers \u00a355 a week, earning him an estimated \u00a370,620 in rent during the peak picking season from January to March. In January, he was fined \u00a321,100 after Wrexham magistrates\u2019 court heard that the building, which lacked planning permission, was \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d and at \u201cimminent risk of fire\u201d, posing a real risk to life. An investigation by Environmental Health News has found that the property was featured on a list of accommodation provided by Staffline Group to newly arrived migrant workers. Currently agencies supplying workers to sectors such as food processing and agriculture must obtain licences from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA). These licences require companies to meet tough standards covering health and safety, pay, accommodation and working conditions, but they only need to ensure workers\u2019 housing is safe if the housing is linked to their jobs. This means Staffline was not under any legal obligation to check Hyperion House met minimum standards before suggesting it. Jim Coy, the Welsh government\u2019s anti-slavery co-ordinator for north Wales, said Staffline did not check the landlords on the list it was giving to migrants. \u201cOn their website, Hyperion House was one of their preferred accommodation venues of a list of 10,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other nine the addresses did exist but when I went to check them physically myself, they had never heard of that company. There had never been any contact with that company and certainly no arrangement to house migrant workers.\u201d Coy said: \u201cThere is a gap in the current legislation which allows people to offer employment and do nothing about accommodation. Surely if people are coming across the world to work here, we must pay due diligence to where they are going to live and the standards of living they are going to receive.\u201d Paul Broadbent, the head of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, which was established after 21 Chinese cockle pickers drowned off Morecombe Bay in 2004, agreed that this was an area where workers could be exploited. \u201cThe GLA is limited as to what it can do under current UK law and regulations unless the workers\u2019 accommodation is being provided directly by one of the agencies we license,\u201d he said. Discussions are ongoing on a number of levels and we will continue to do whatever we can, legally and ethically, to prevent worker exploitation and protect vulnerable people. \u201cAs a government regulator we are bound by statute and not opinion, and the fact remains that there is no requirement in current legislation for companies to check out any accommodation that it \u2018recommends\u2019.\u201d Staffline Group, which supplies up to 45,000 temporary workers each day to thousands of farms, food processors, warehouses, and care homes across the UK, said it did not either directly or indirectly place workers in accommodation. \u201cWe do not place workers in accommodation either directly or effectively in line with the governing regulations. However, we do try to help the workers as much as we can within these constraints and, having consulted the guidance offered by Gangmasters Licensing Authority\u2019s Brief 38, we therefore collate a list of potential accommodation for workers to refer to when they are finding and selecting their own accommodation,\u201d it said in a statement. The group\u2019s full year financial results reveal its revenues are up 40 per cent to \u00a3702.2m and its underlying profits are up 52 per cent to \u00a328.3m. Jane Bladon, Staffline\u2019s head of compliance, said Hyperion House was on the list because workers recommended it to Staffline. \u201cBack in that time there were no such checks done on any of the people that go on our disclaimers. So it was by word of mouth or reputation. Somebody would tell us that was OK to live at, that the standards were what we looking for, and it was affordable,\u2019 she said. This year Staffline had introduced a new system for helping migrants find accommodation to ensure they were not dealing with \u201cdisreputable companies\u201d. \u201cWe are going to meet the accommodation provider, which is something we have never done before and make sure we going to be happy with what they are supplying to workers. We are going to audit a sample of their accommodation. If they aren\u2019t up to scratch then we aren\u2019t going to put them on the disclaimer,\u201d said Bladon. \u201cSo we going a little bit further than we ever did before.\u201d Waitrose said it was not responsible for where migrant workers rented but said it had been in touch with Staffline and the supplier who employed the workers. \u201cWe take workers\u2019 welfare very seriously and although we could never be held responsible for accommodation that workers privately rent we are in contact with our supplier and the recruitment agency they use to ensure they are doing all they can to support workers,\u201d it said. Tesco said it was the relationship between the workers and the landlord was a private one. \u201cWe are looking into this incident, but we understand that the accommodation in this case was a private arrangement between the workers and landlord, not organised by our supplier or the labour agency. As a founder member of the Ethical Trading Initiative, we take these issues very seriously and work closely with the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and other organisations to ensure good practice in our own supply chain.\u201d The Home Office said councils already had powers to tackle rogue landlords and insisted that there were no gaps in the gangmaster licensing regime. \u201cThis is not a loophole: existing legislation and housing standards offer strong protection to those who rent from private landlords,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cWe are determined to crack down on rogue landlords and the Housing Bill will introduce banning orders, fines and a database for the worst offenders.\u201d This article was corrected on 9 May 2016. The image of Paul Broadbent is from his time at South Yorkshire police as a chief superintendent, not as an assistant chief constable."
"20||Florence Foster Jenkins: we may laugh, but to be this bad took talentIt was one of David Bowie\u2019s favourite records. That may be as much of a recommendation as anyone needs, but Bowie\u2019s fulsome appreciation of The Glory of the Human Voice, the deliciously ironic title for RCA\u2019s release of Florence Foster Jenkins\u2019s recordings, is itself a wonderful distillation of the Florence phenomenon: \u201cShe had and was blissfully unaware of, the worst set of pipes in the world of music \u2026 Be afraid, be very afraid\u201d. You\u2019d have to be very brave or very stupid to go against Bowie\u2019s opinions. Thankfully, I\u2019m both, and on the eve of Stephen Frears\u2019s new film that celebrates her life, and her climactic 1944 performance at Carnegie Hall, it\u2019s time for a little perspective on the Florence story. For a start, to make your public debut anywhere as a singer at the age of 76 is a terrifying prospect; to do it at Carnegie Hall, New York\u2019s prestigious concert venue, requires astonishing reserves of self-confidence, and quite possibly, self-deception. She might have been a truly terrible singer, but Florence Foster Jenkins was musically talented. There, I said it. As a child, she was touted as a piano prodigy, played her first public recital at the age of eight, and as \u201cLittle Miss Foster\u201d performed at the White House for President Rutherford B Hayes. Her devotion to music led to her break from her family: her wealthy father refused to sanction further musical study, so she eloped with a much older man, who she married aged 17 or 18. The union was a disaster, not least because she contracted syphilis from her husband (treatment for the disease would make her completely bald in later life). As a newly single woman she supported herself by teaching piano but that career collapsed, however, after an arm injury meant she couldn\u2019t play. It was only through her mother, and then her father\u2019s inheritance after his death in 1909, that Florence started her transformation into the grandiose grande dame of Manhattan society. As St Clair Bayfield wrote (Bayfield became her common-law husband and manager), the essence of the Florence Foster Jenkins story was that she never knew what her singing voice was really like. Not because she couldn\u2019t hear it, but because she lived as a legend in her own lifetime. Her annual vocal recitals resounded in a gilded echo chamber of praise, approbation, and acclaim for the brilliance of the Verdi Club\u2019s president. It would have been social suicide in the echelons of Manhattan\u2019s high society for any mere member to risk criticism of their patroness \u2013 and only a handful ever did. After her recordings (which have never been out of print) appeared in the early 1940s, she would play her own performances of the Queen of the Night\u2019s Act 2 aria from Mozart\u2019s The Magic Flute to her friends alongside versions by genuinely glorious divas Luisa Tetrazzini and Frieda Hempel. Without saying which was which (and my goodness, you really can tell the difference \u2026), she would ask her audience to write down which they preferred. As Donald Collup\u2019s documentary on Florence, A World of Her Own reveals, only one person is known to have demurred from the opinion that hers was the best, and this bravely honest person was promptly castigated by Florence for her lack of taste. That Queen of the Night recording is the unimpeachable, incomparable classic of the \u2013 alas \u2013 very small Foster Jenkins discography, with her accompanist, the joyously monikered Cosm\u00e9 McMoon. But the notion that she couldn\u2019t sing a single note in tune or in time is wide of the mark. True, most of her recordings are the right notes in the wrong place, but if you dare to listen to her other recordings, you will discover that Florence did have a very occasional relationship with musical accuracy, which of course only makes the effect of the whole more miraculously hilarious. But make no mistake: being this bad is hard. One of the reviews of the Carnegie Hall concert got it right. Robert Bagar in the New York World Telegram wrote: \u201cOf all the singers appearing before the public today, only Mme. Jenkins has perfected the art of giving added zest to a written phrase by improvising it in quarter tones, either above or below the original notes. Think of the difficulties involved in making this possible\u201d. Bagar was right. You try it: those exquisite shadings of pitch and frissons of out-of-tune vibrato are perfectly designed to induce the greatest possible injury to the piece, and to your eardrums. And they are almost impossible to replicate, because what makes them so magical in Florence\u2019s performances is that you can hear that she is really trying for the right note, the right word, the right rhythm. The truth of is, most of us are more like Florence than we are Tetrazzini, so perhaps we hear some echo of our common humanity in her vocal trials and tribulations. But Florence had something else too: a sheer joy in her performances. Here\u2019s Bagar again: \u201cShe was exceedingly happy in her work. It is a pity that so few artists are, and the happiness was communicated, as if by magic to her hearers\u201d. Florence had a heart attack days after the Carnegie Hall recital \u2013 perhaps induced by reading her reviews \u2013 and she died a month later. But that heroically misplaced happiness in her abilities still communicates today; indelibly, appallingly, magnificently. The \u201cworst set of pipes in the world\u201d? Perhaps not, after all \u2026 Florence Foster Jenkins is on general UK release from Friday 6 May."
"1||Italy seeks to reassure Asian tourists with imported Chinese policeOn Rome\u2019s glamorous Via Condotti, deep-pocketed Chinese tourists have long been seen as the lifeblood of one of Europe\u2019s most vaunted shopping destinations, outspending Russians, Britons and Italians on luxury goods. Now, following the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels and amid signs that Chinese visitors are feeling slightly less at ease in Europe, Italy has become the first European capital to take an extra step to try to accommodate these wealthy patrons. For the next two weeks a small group of Chinese police officers, wearing the same uniforms they wear at home, will be patrolling the streets of Rome and Milan alongside Italian counterparts, ostensibly so that they can present a familiar face to visiting tourists from China who, for example, have had a run-in with a pickpocket at Termini railway station or got lost on their way to the Colosseum. After all, said Italy\u2019s chief of police, Alessandro Pansa, all it took was one lost document to make a tourist feel vulnerable. Italy\u2019s interior minister, Angelino Alfano, was gushing with praise for the new arrangement at a press conference this week, even as he pointed out that crime and murder rates in Italy were at an all-time low. In a statement that could be deemed controversial coming from the most senior official in charge of Italy\u2019s internal security, Alfano said the move was noteworthy for \u201cbreaking the old paradigm\u201d in which policing was seen as an issue of national sovereignty. He said Chinese tourists \u201cwould have been protected anyway, but now they will feel even more protected\u201d. The bigger question is whether this temporary arrangement \u2013 which will also involve Italian officers going to China \u201cin the future\u201d \u2013 will pave the way for closer collaboration on other law enforcement issues, including tackling organised crime within Italy\u2019s Chinese community. Before the policing initiative was formally unveiled, one of Italy\u2019s leading daily newspapers, Corriere della Sera, reported that the goal of the collaboration was to help Italian officers break through a culture of silence in the Chinese community\u2019s dealings with the police. Federico Varese, an expert on international organised crime at Oxford University, said that in Italy there were immigrant communities that were known to be reluctant to report crimes and develop relationships with the police. \u201cInstead, if there is a crime or something goes wrong, members of that community go to local people who have authority,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important for authorities to bring people back into the fold and not allow these other people to emerge as community leaders, but it is difficult.\u201d One area of concern is the ties between Chinese organised crime and the \u2018Ndrangheta mafia, which is based in Calabria. While the \u2018Ndrangheta are known for trafficking cocaine in Europe, Varese said cheap and illegal Chinese goods were also known to be imported into Italy through hubs controlled by the notoriously brutal mafia. Bringing in Chinese police could be a good idea, Varese said, even though it also raised possible questions about civil liberties given China\u2019s record on human rights. He suggested the move could be seen as an affront to Chinese dissidents living in Italy, though no specific criticism has been aired publicly. The Italian government has dropped hints that the relationship with Chinese authorities could develop further. Pansa, the chief of police, said the policing initiative could open the door to other collaboration, including pooling resources to confront criminal elements and terrorist threats that require international cooperation. \u201cFor the future, we don\u2019t know how it will develop, because this will be a political choice that has to be taken,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the interior ministry. The simple goal for now was to help tourists, though they were not actually in danger, she added. Jan Gaspers, head of research at the European China policy unit at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Germany, said it was unlikely that the police swap was aimed at organised crime. Instead, he said, it was probably an attempt to address domestic politics in China, where the government is under pressure to show it is doing everything it can to protect Chinese citizens abroad, especially after the death of 24-year-old Frank Deng, a Chinese citizen killed in the Brussels attacks. \u201cLooking at Italy and France, these are top destinations for Chinese tourists, so there is also pressure on them to do something and I can see why Italians would find it attractive,\u201d he said. A similar scheme was proposed and developed in France in 2014 but was never executed. Gaspers said a potential downside, which he believed had prompted France to pull out of the similar scheme, was that it might not send the right message to have foreign police patrolling one\u2019s own streets, even if, as in this case, they did not wield any real authority. For Italy, apparently, the \u20ac229bn that Chinese tourists spend abroad each year was a stronger pull."

"15||The Flint water crisis is a shadow on Obama's legacyIn the final months of the Obama administration, the president\u2019s legacy is the subject of much speculation. The president admitted last week that the lack of planning for post-Libya intervention was the administration\u2019s biggest mistake. While historians will debate this question, I beg to disagree. I believe history will judge that the \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d of the Obama presidency was the lack of leadership in the poisoning of Flint, Michigan. No question, the poisoning rises to the level of criminal negligence involving gross mismanagement and cover-ups. Hundreds of young people will, as a result, never achieve their intellectual promise. How different the reaction of the Obama administration would have been if Isis had claimed responsibility for poisoning Flint. Flint\u2019s water has been dangerously contaminated with lead since April 2014, when Michigan governor Rick Snyder\u2019s administration oversaw the city\u2019s switch to the Flint river as its water source in order to save money. State regulators warned the city not to treat the water with anti-corrosion chemicals that would cause lead to leach out of pipes made from heavy metal. It would be unimaginably refreshing to hear an American president exercise intellectual and moral honesty, admit that senior-level members of his administration had violated the public trust, and proceed to take responsibility for the disaster that occurred under his watch. No one is expecting this to happen, but we can all dream. The Obama administration\u2019s failure in Flint has become the nightmare of thousands of unsuspecting citizens. The trip will be Obama\u2019s first visit to Flint since the city\u2019s water crisis became a national story. He visited Detroit, only 90 miles from Flint, in January to attend the Detroit auto show and pledged to \u201chave the backs of Flint\u2019s people\u201d during a speech there: \u201cI know that if I was a parent up there (in Flint), I would be beside myself that my kids\u2019 health could be at risk.\u201d Many children in Flint have probably experienced irreversible brain damage and adults could potentially suffer liver and kidney diseases. It\u2019s safer for the president to talk about lead pipes and water filters than to talk about the failure of his leadership. It has taken this president almost two years to travel to Flint for what has been promoted as a \u201cbriefing\u201d. According to the EPA administrator\u2019s testimony before Congress, she knew that the citizens of Flint were exposed to poisoned water nearly a year before the incident became a matter of public information. Members of Congress have called for the resignations of both the Michigan governor and the EPA administrator. While Obama does not have the authority to unseat Snyder, the head of EPA, Gina McCarthy, serves at the pleasure of the president. The citizens of Flint deserve to know why McCarthy didn\u2019t use her congressionally mandated emergency powers under the Safe Drinking Water Act to seize control of Flint water system. SDWA Section 1431 says: \u2026 Upon receipt of information that a contaminant that is present in or likely to enter a public water system or an underground source of drinking water \u2026 that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, the EPA administrator may take any action she deems necessary to protect human health. McCarthy, with or without the governor\u2019s consent, should have provided precautionary warnings to the citizens of Flint that they were drinking, bathing and cooking in poisoned water. The nation waits to see if the president will seize this opportunity to candidly engage in an intellectually honest disclosure of what really happened in Flint and how he intends to fix it. Will Obama demonstrate remorse for the suffering of this community and hundreds of communities across America facing lead poisoning by demanding the resignation of the EPA administrator? We can all dream."
"29||Hulu renews both The Path and The Mindy Project for new seasonsHulu has confirmed plans to bring back The Mindy Project for a fifth season, and to renew drama series The Path starring Aaron Paul, for a second run following its well-received debut season. The announcement was made at a company presentation on Wednesday in New York, reports Variety. Created by and starring The Office\u2019s Mindy Kaling, The Mindy Project aired on Fox until it was canceled last year, prompting Hulu to step in to save it. The sitcom follows OB-GYN Dr Mindy Lahiri (Kaling), who\u2019s struggling to balance a love life with her bustling work one. Chris Messina, who plays her on-and-off love interest, is expected to return. Kaling was on hand to address the news, praising her show\u2019s new home for allowing her \u201cfreedom to try new things that would not fly on broadcast\u201d. The Path, which concludes its 10-episode first season on 25 May, stars Paul and Michelle Monaghan as a married couple wrapped up in a cult-like religious movement. The series, from Parenthood creator Jessica Goldberg, has received generally favorable reviews since premiering in March, with Indiewire proclaiming it to be \u201cthe first great drama series of 2016\u201d. Hulu has also obtained exclusive rights to stream Ron Howard\u2019s documentary about the Beatles, shortly after its theatrical release in the fall. His film, tentatively titled The Beatles: Eight Days a Week, marks the first documentary feature to receive a premiere exclusively on Hulu, after opening in cinemas. The film will launch under the company\u2019s new documentary films arm, which will produce original and exclusive documentary titles. Produced with the cooperation of Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono Lennon and Olivia Harrison, Howard\u2019s film recounts the band\u2019s breakthrough success from 1962 to 1966. It\u2019s said to feature rare and exclusive footage. The Beatles: Eight Days a Week is Howard\u2019s second documentary following 2013\u2019s Made in America, which saw the film-maker and actor go behind the scenes of Jay Z\u2019s music festival of the same name."
"1||David Cameron announces concessions on child refugeesCouncils will be contacted next week and told they should be prepared to accept unaccompanied refugee children from Greece, Italy and France, after David Cameron climbed down on the issue in parliament. MPs were told that local authorities could be asked to provide homes to 3,000 children, but Downing Street denied that a figure had been agreed, and councils revealed that each child would cost \u00a350,000 to resettle. The prime minister\u2019s U-turn quashed a growing rebellion among Conservative MPs who were prepared to vote against their government in favour of an amendment by a Labour peer, Alf Dubs. Tory politicians who have been vocal about the issue, including Heidi Allen, David Burrowes and Stephen Phillips, all welcomed the climbdown and were told by ministers that the work would start straight away. Lord Dubs, who came to Britain as a refugee through the Kindertransport, had been leading the campaign for the UK to accept 3,000 children from European camps. His first attempt was voted down by Conservative MPs but the peer resubmitted the amendment without a specific figure attached, which Cameron said he was now willing to accept. The prime minister said the government would speed up the process of accepting children with direct family links in the UK and would provide homes for others who arrived in Europe before the deal between the EU and Turkey over handling the refugee crisis. \u201cNo country has done more than Britain to help when it comes to Syrian refugees. But I do want us to proceed with as much support across the house as I can,\u201d Cameron told MPs. But he added: \u201cI think it is right to stick to the principle that we shouldn\u2019t be encouraging people to make this dangerous journey. I think it is right to stick to the idea that we invest in the refugee camps in the neighbouring countries.\u201d The Tory leader was careful not to mention numbers but his immigration minister, James Brokenshire, told potential Tory rebels that councils had given homes to around 3,000 unaccompanied children last year. The Guardian understands that he hinted that they might be asked to resettle thousands more children but Home Office sources said no number had been agreed. The Local Government Association (LGA) said councils had a strong record of supporting refugees but said they wanted clarification on the long-term funding arrangements and how children would be dispersed across the country. Cllr David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA\u2019s refugees task group, said: \u201cIt is vital that the scheme announced today is fully aligned, and funded, alongside this and other existing programmes for resettling refugees, ensuring that councils are able to properly support these vulnerable children while continuing to provide vital services for their local community.\u201d Allen described the climbdown as \u201cbrilliant news\u201d. She said the decision to only take children who arrived before the Turkey deal was a \u201cslightly artificial line in the sand\u201d but she understood that ministers wanted to send a clear message to traffickers. \u201cWe are not letting anyone wiggle out of any commitments and I have every confidence that the government will honour its commitments,\u201d she added. Phillips, who spent the day meeting refugee children at camps in Athens with the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, said: \u201cThe announcement from number 10 today will give these children hope after all they have suffered.\u201d He had described this as the \u201cgreatest migration challenge since the second world war\u201d and had been vocal in his opposition to the government\u2019s reluctance to accept more children. Burrowes added that the details would have to be carefully examined and scrutinised but said it would mean Britain was leading the way. The move means the government will not face any rebellion over the issue but it is still being pressed over another Lords amendment calling for a ban on pregnant women being held in immigration detention. Conservative MPs want to see their ministers at least concede that detention will only be used as a last resort. Cooper was also pleased that the decision made in London could have a positive impact on the lives of the children in the Greek UN camp. \u201cThere are 35 unaccompanied children here who have no proper shelter and are at risk. The ones who are most at risk aren\u2019t even in the camps or the shelters. There are so many children who are not in proper school or in proper accommodation,\u201d she said. Save the Children\u2019s chief executive, Tanya Steele, said the charity welcomed \u201ctoday\u2019s significant announcement that the UK will offer them sanctuary and the chance to build a new life here\u201d. \u201cRefugee children, many of whom have fled war and persecution, and have made dangerous journeys to Europe alone are now living on the streets, in overcrowded camps or locked in police detention,\u201d she said."
"30||Thousands of court cases adjourned due to failures in interpreting servicesMore than 2,600 court cases have been adjourned over the past five years because of failures in the interpreting service, according to figures released by the Ministry of Justice. The extent of the problem was confirmed as doubts emerged about the viability of the troubled contract for interpreting services after the outsourcing firm Capita declined to bid for its renewal in October. A war crimes trial at the Old Bailey collapsed last year and has had to be rescheduled because of problems over the quality of interpreting offered to the defendant, a Nepalese army officer. The figures for the number of cases rescheduled since 2011, when the new contract paying lower rates came into effect, have been provided by the justice minister Lord Faulks. In the magistrates courts, 2,524 trials have had to be adjourned because of the lack of an interpreter over the past five years. In the crown court, where costs are far greater, 137 trials have had to be adjourned because of interpreter difficulties. The cumulative expense of the adjournments was not recorded. Commenting on the failures, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 justice spokesman, Lord Marks QC, said: \u201cIt goes without saying that every time an interpreter fails to turn up, either injustice is done, because the case goes on without one, or the case has to be adjourned, leading to delays and a waste of everyone\u2019s time and costs. \u201cEven with improvement against targets, the number of court cases adjourned owing to the lack of interpreters has remained stubbornly high. As one judge put it, the only just target is 100% attendance. With the next contract the government must ensure effective and efficient attendance of high-quality interpreters at court to enable justice to be delivered.\u201d Capita, which has held the contract to provide interpreters in England and Wales for the past four years, has been heavily criticised in the past. Last year it was ordered to pay \u00a316,000 by the most senior judge in the family courts for its \u201clamentable\u201d failure to provide interpreters seven times in the course of a single adoption case. In 2013, the justice select committee described the manner in which the court interpreting service was privatised as shambolic. Asked why it had decided not to bid for the main contract after being shortlisted, a Capita spokesperson said: \u201cWe took the decision to bid solely for Lot 2 [the more predictable \u2018written translation and transcription\u2019 service]. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.\u201d Geoffrey Buckingham, an executive member of the European Legal Interpreters and Translators Association, said: \u201cThe available pool of interpreters is already limited, and the word is that many now have enough experience to move on to better-paid work. If borne out, then quality will continue to fall. \u201cThe MoJ has not learned any lessons. The team names have changed, but the process is so flawed that one of those shortlisted in December has walked away. Capita Translation and Interpreting recently wrote to their interpreters saying they had taken the \u2018strategic decision\u2019 to withdraw from the procurement [process].\u201d Following Capita\u2019s withdrawal, the two remaining bidders for the main contract are the Leeds-based translation company thebigword and the US firm TransPerfect. Earlier this week, thebigword won a \u00a315m contract to provide telephone and face-to-face interpreting and translation services to UK central government organisations. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cWe are absolutely committed to improving performance and ensuring the highest standard of language services for those who need them. \u201cOur latest figures show a 98% success rate in 2015 \u2013 the highest since the interpreting contract began \u2013 with complaints about the service at a record low, down 30% on last year. Since this contract was introduced, we have also spent \u00a338m less on language service fees.\u201d Interpreters are self-employed and under no obligation to accept job requests. A boycott by interpreters three years ago, in protest at low pay rates, failed to persuade the government to abandon the contract."
"7||Cuthbertson believes toiling Leeds Rhinos can find form in Challenge CupAdam Cuthbertson believes Leeds\u2019 defence of the Challenge Cup offers the faltering Super League champions a chance to refresh and refocus in a competition in which he knows nothing but success. The Australian played a pivotal role in Leeds\u2019 run to Wembley glory against Hull KR in last year\u2019s final and, after four weeks on the sidelines out with an elbow injury, he returns on Friday as they attempt to avoid a first defeat in the competition in almost three years when they travel to Huddersfield. Victory against their West Yorkshire rivals, who were the last side to beat Leeds in the competition back in May 2013, would put the Rhinos within two wins of a third consecutive Wembley appearance, and with last year\u2019s treble winners languishing at the bottom of the table, Cuthbertson believes the cup offers Leeds vital relief from their troubled Super League defence. \u201cThe cup is absolutely great,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know too much about it last year coming into Super League for the first time. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air for our season because it\u2019s a different focus for us, it\u2019s a knockout game and it really tests your character, to see if we can put the last few months behind us. \u201cIt can be a springboard for your season. Games like these can boost morale for the group and it creates hope and possibility that something special can happen.\u201d Cuthbertson confesses he has found it hard not to count down the days to the return of the Challenge Cup. \u201cI\u2019d never really played in anything like it back home since I was at school,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great concept and I love it; I got to be involved in the final last year and the journey to that game was something very special. \u201cIt was one of the standout moments of my career so far. You don\u2019t get it back home and the gaps between games builds the excitement and builds the tension for them. It\u2019s a very exciting competition and one I love.\u201d Cuthbertson is one of two changes to the Leeds squad for Friday\u2019s game alongside the returning Zak Hardaker, and although it has been a poor season for the Rhinos, the 31-year-old believes both he and the team are in far better shape than when he suffered his injury. \u201cThere\u2019s been some testing times but it\u2019s about how we get through it and come through the other side,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough up until now but I genuinely believe we\u2019re starting to see the light. It\u2019s been hard being on the sidelines but I\u2019ve used the last four weeks to get fitter and a lot healthier \u2013 and I feel the best I\u2019ve felt since early last year.\u201d"
"15||David Attenborough, you askin\u2019? I\u2019m starstruckThe Queen is used to all the people she meets looking slightly stunned, and the same must go for David Attenborough, who this Sunday reaches his 90th birthday. There is no shame in being starstruck in this great man\u2019s presence, and on the two occasions I have met him I have been reduced to a gibbering jelly. The second was after he presented an excellent film on wildlife in the South Atlantic at London\u2019s Science Museum, and he very charmingly agreed to be photographed with my 10-year-old son \u2013 with me taking it on my phone. I was wobbling and quivering so much the picture came out blurry, and my son has never quite forgiven me. Some time before that I was introduced to him at BBC Broadcasting House, and he said he was about to bring out a new programme called The Life of Birds and in a supernova of nervousness, I grotesquely attempted the following joke: \u201cOh! You\u2019re doing a remake! That sitcom with Polly James and Nerys Hughes! \u2018You askin\u2019? \u2013 I\u2019m askin\u2019 \u2013 I\u2019m dancin\u2019! Hahahaha.\u201d (For younger readers, that was the opening dialogue to The Liver Birds.) I subsided into silence and, with enormous delicacy and tact, Attenborough gave a tiny, charitable laugh and said: \u201cNo, The \u2013 Life \u2013 of \u2013 Birds.\u201d As the former BBC2 controller who commissioned Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus, Attenborough incidentally knows about comedy. They say don\u2019t meet your heroes \u2026 because you will make a fool of yourself in their presence. First-class ticket to rage According to legend, one of the great pleasures in being rich is turning left on entering an aeroplane \u2013 because you are heading for first class. (A journalist friend said that on interviewing a hot young actor, you should let them talk about important issues and then find some puppyish, faux-naif way of asking them how they felt when they first went on a private jet.) But nowadays people enter aeroplanes from the front, and the resulting class envy is causing a spike in air-rage incidents. The lower orders troop sullenly through the luxurious part, heading for their cramped and hideous seats at the rear, incidentally making resentful eye contact with the pampered elite who have, of course, been allowed on to the aircraft first. It is a unique experience of inequality \u2013 like letting council tenants walk through a plutocrat\u2019s luxurious townhouse before being led out to their humbler dwellings nearby. But the class rage is not just coming from below. The first-class passengers are acting up, misbehaviour triggered by defensive anxiety at getting up close and personal with the hoi polloi. Jerry Seinfeld used to say that the flight attendant does a little look at the economy class passengers before she closes the curtain, as if to say: \u201cMaybe if you worked a little harder \u2026\u201d Now, wealthy people on planes feel the little look of reproach is directed at them. Online rhymes It\u2019s always great to discover a new poet, and the American writer and journalist Jason O Gilbert has found one \u2013 it\u2019s the question-and-answer website Quora, where requests for information are met by its users. Gilbert has playfully taken the most wistful questions posted, and strung them together. Here are some sample stanzas: \u201cAre the real estate prices in Palo Alto crazy? / Do welfare programmes make poor people lazy? / What are some of the biggest lies ever told? / How do I explain bitcoin to a six-year-old? / Why is powdered alcohol not successful so far? / How does UberX handle vomiting in the car? / Is being worth $10bn considered \u201crich\u201d? / What can be causing my upper lip to twitch?\u201d It is a literary artefact worthy of Douglas Coupland. This could revive the whole concept of found poetry."
"1||Child refugees: Cameron retreat avoids Tory revolt and numbers gameDavid Cameron has for the first time conceded the principle that lone child refugees who have travelled to Europe but who do not have any direct family connection to the UK should be given sanctuary in Britain. The prime minister has been willing to pay that price to avoid the risk of rebellious Conservative MPs \u2013 who may have included former cabinet ministers such as Sir Eric Pickles \u2013 rejecting the government\u2019s refusal to let child refugees already in Europe into Britain. By accepting a second amendment to the immigration bill from the Labour peer Lord Dubs \u2013 who has proposed a resettlement plan for the refugees \u2013 the government has also avoided having to make a specific commitment on the numbers of extra child refugees brought to Britain due to the concession. Instead, that number, whether it is in the hundreds or thousands, will be determined by talks between the government and local authorities. But the track record so far is not promising. Repeated appeals by Kent and Croydon, whose social services are already under strain, to other local councils to share responsibility, have largely fallen on deaf ears, while Home Office attempts to get a voluntary dispersal scheme under way have faltered. One alternative might be for the government finally to take up the offer from thousands of members of the public to house refugees themselves. Ministers have so far rejected this option on the grounds that those brought directly from the Middle East camps would be the most vulnerable and would need experienced foster families to handle their complex needs. But now Cameron has conceded that lone child refugees in Europe should get sanctuary in Britain, it should be the time to revisit those offers. Save the Children says that 10,000 people have offered places under the Homes for Refugees scheme and they can be given foster training to look after the child victims of war and persecution. If the limit to numbers Britain can take is to be determined by the generosity of the public then there is no reason why those given sanctuary could not far exceed in number the original 3,000 figure proposed. Lord Dubs, a Kindertransport child, was forced to drop the 3,000 figure in his original amendment under the threat of it being declared a money measure so unable to be insisted upon again by the Lords once rejected by the Commons. The fine print means that no one who arrived in Europeafter 23 March, when the EU-Turkey deal on asylum was struck, will be eligible for the new scheme. So traffickers will not be able to use it to \u201cadvertise\u201d the UK as a new destination to people in north Africa. It is also likely that most child refugees will come from Italy and Greece rather than the Calais camps. Cameron may think he has minimised the potential numbers involved by accepting an unspecified commitment, but there is no reason why its open-ended nature should not mean more refugees get sanctuary rather than fewer. However, within 20 minutes of Cameron announcing his concession on child refugees, his immigration minister, James Brokenshire, was telling MPs that Britain intended an \u201copt-out\u201d and refusal to take part in the EU\u2019s reformed asylum rules. At heart these reforms would mean other EU member states being committed to taking an allocation of asylum seekers, under a \u201cfairness mechanism\u201d, from countries like Italy and Greece which have had asylum flows 150% above normal levels. What all this means is that while Cameron has agreed to take a further unspecified number of lone child refugees, he has also firmly set his face against Britain doing its bit to tackle the European refugee crisis."

"20||Like Radiohead's Burn the Witch? Try Jonny Greenwood\u2019s orchestral workLet\u2019s assume that, like a few million others, you\u2019ve viewed the video for Burn the Witch \u2013 Radiohead\u2019s first new song in five years (and the lead single from their rumored/forthcoming full-length album). Perhaps the first thing you noticed in the song was its use of strings. That feature does a lot of the work in the piece: sometimes it sounds finger-plucked (AKA pizzicato) and nervy, while at other points there\u2019s a more clattering, aggressive vibe (courtesy of the string players striking the strings with the back of the bow, known as \u201ccol legno\u201d). Occasionally, there\u2019s some traditionally lyrical string music as well (check out the gorgeous bit that introduces singer Thom Yorke\u2019s second verse). And at the climax, there are more frantic articulations coming from the string orchestra at work behind our familiar Radiohead players. The final half-minute of Burn the Witch doesn\u2019t merely find the strings playing louder; this bit also introduces some bracing, keening sonorities from the bowed string instruments. None of these techniques are new to modernist writing for string orchestra. Col legno and other \u201cextended techniques\u201d are a familiar part of contemporary classical music. Nor is any of this new to the work of Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood \u2013who has maintained an impressive sideline career of writing symphonic music and scores for the cinema. While we don\u2019t have full session details for Burn the Witch just yet, it\u2019s safe to assume that Greenwood had a hand in the arrangement. (The American composer Steve Reich, who has worked with the guitarist, once told me that Greenwood is the only member of Radiohead who reads notated music.) Greenwood has been denied best-score Oscar nominations for There Will Be Blood and The Master, due to the fact that his scores for those PT Anderson films included pre-existing material from Greenwood\u2019s bigger orchestral works. The menacing orchestral glissandos from the former date from Greenwood\u2019s piece Popcorn Superhet Receiver, while the most memorable symphonic music from The Master can be found in the composer\u2019s work 48 Responses to Polymorphia. Both pieces are available on a comparatively unknown 2012 album from the Nonesuch label. (They\u2019re paired with classic compositions by the Polish modernist composer Krzysztof Penderecki, whose work exerts a clear influence on Greenwood.) As its title suggests, 48 Responses to Polymorphia is a reply to a Penderecki\u2019s Polymorphia \u2013 which, after all its density and noise, ends with a startlingly pure C major chord. Greenwood\u2019s piece takes that chord and builds a hymn-like melody around it, in the first movement. The aggressive \u201cextended techniques\u201d familiar from other Penderecki works crop up again soon enough (as on the movement Baton Sparks, which was included in The Master). But the piece ends with some more percussive string-slaps that will be familiar to fans of Burn the Witch. In addition to the occasional col legno playing, the string musicians are also instructed to play \u201cpacay bean shakers\u201d, which adds to the overall thrum of beats: If you\u2019re looking for some more Burn the Witch-style music to tide you over until Radiohead\u2019s ninth full-length album comes out, turn to these performances of Greenwood\u2019s orchestral music. Even if you already treasure the soundtracks to There Will Be Blood and The Master, there\u2019s lots more Greenwoodian experimentation with texture to be found in the full works."
"9||Leicester\u2019s success has definite echoes of what we achieved at Nottingham ForestI can understand why people see similarities between this Leicester City side and the one I played in at Nottingham Forest, and it\u2019s because of what happened to us all those years ago that I was always wary of writing off Claudio Ranieri\u2019s team. I\u2019m probably the same as most people \u2013 earlier this season I didn\u2019t think they would hold on, but I remember how people used to say our \u201cbubble would burst\u201d. It never did and that stopped me from saying the same about Leicester. Bob Wilson used that line about the bubble bursting but it wasn\u2019t just him in fairness. Lots of people thought we would tail away. People seemed to have this impression of us as being a \u201cragtag and bobtail\u201d team. We were good players and sometimes when you hear that kind of stuff it\u2019s almost as if the manager has had his team talk written for him. We ended up winning the league, two European Cups and the Super Cup, as well as a couple of League Cups and a 42-match unbeaten run. The other thing is that Leicester haven\u2019t won the league at the first attempt, whereas Forest did it the year after promotion. So maybe the only time we can really compare the two sides properly will be a few years down the road if Leicester win a couple of European Cups. Only time will tell about that. But in today\u2019s game it\u2019s still an absolutely fantastic achievement for Leicester to win the Premier League. I doubt there was anyone in the country \u2013 apart from the one or two people who stuck a bet on \u2013 who would have backed them at the start of the season, but it isn\u2019t just this season they have been outstanding. It\u2019s the last year. They were bottom of the league in April last year so if you look at their record since then it\u2019s been phenomenal for a long time. With Forest, you could probably understand the doubts because we had just gone up from the old Second Division. We scraped up really, in third place. Someone told me recently we had the fifth lowest points in history for a promoted side and it was only the year before that we were playing York City at Bootham Crescent. If you look at the team that day, there was Colin Barrett, Frank Clark, John McGovern, Ian Bowyer, Martin O\u2019Neill, John O\u2019Hare and myself in the starting line-up. That\u2019s seven players who were winning European Cup winners\u2019 medals a few years later. We lost 3-2 to York that day. In Brian Clough we had a genius as our manager, of course, and we played some terrific attacking football. I\u2019ll never forget our first match, though, at Everton. It was like the Alamo in the first 20 minutes, we just couldn\u2019t get our breath. But then we got a goal from a corner and suddenly everything clicked. We won 3-1 and, after that, we really enjoyed ourselves. I was on the left and we started the season with a 4-3-3 system where I wasn\u2019t expected to get back too much while Martin O\u2019Neill did a lot of the donkey work on the other side. Then we changed to 4-4-2 in the second half of the season. That wasn\u2019t quite so attacking but we always managed to win. I can\u2019t really remember any occasion when we got nervous during the run-in. Maybe that\u2019s because we won it with four games still to play. Maybe, doing it so early, the nervousness hadn\u2019t come in yet. Down the spine of the side we had two no-nonsense centre-halves in Larry Lloyd and Kenny Burns. The two at Leicester, Wes Morgan and Robert Huth, are no-nonsense too and we\u2019ve seen how good they are, like we were, at keeping clean sheets. Our defence was really strong and, behind them, we had the world\u2019s greatest goalkeeper in Peter Shilton. Everyone has been talking about what a great player Riyad Mahrez is, and Jamie Vardy has obviously scored a lot of goals, but it\u2019s not just two or three players who have won them the league. Danny Drinkwater\u2019s a player. We\u2019ve spoken about how good their defence is and my old team-mate Frank Clark is always talking about N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. I was at Leicester for four years, working with Martin O\u2019Neill when he was manager, and we had some fantastic times. We had a really good side who finished regularly in the top 10 and we won the League Cup twice. I imagine a lot of people thought that was possibly as far as a club of Leicester\u2019s size could reach. It\u2019s fantastic they have shown they can go even further and you can\u2019t really praise them enough."

"7||County cricket \u2013 as it happenedThe game is petering out. Yorkshire were set 320 to win, and Jake Ball, as in the first innings, made an immediate impact by removing Adam Lyth in his first over. And as with the first innings there was an element of good fortune in that the batsman got a touch down the leg side and Chris Read completed a sprawling catch. Since then though Alex Lees and Gary Ballance have managed to survive and in the final session Yorkshire require a further 256 in 35 overs, albeit with nine wickets in hand. Hands will be shaken at the earliest opportunity. Earlier, Read\u2019s 25th hundred was the glue that held the Nottinghamshire innings together, dragging them first of all from a situation where they were only 122 ahead with four wickets left, (he had only 13 at the time) to 348, the point at which he was last out for 101, caught on the fence. It was a brilliant innings although the Yorkshire bowling was poor at times. But he attacked at the right time, found allies in Stuart Broad, and later Ball, and Jackson Bird, and in all, over 179 balls he hit 14 fours and three sixes. Two ancient left-handers are holding up Lancashire. Between them Marcus Trescothick and Chris Rogers have mustered more than 48,000 runs between them and they carefully gleaned a few more under the cloudless skies of Taunton. Somerset are not yet safe. Bear in mind that they contrived to lose three wickets in one over just after lunch yesterday. So there is work to be done by both sides. Somerset with eight wickets remaining are still 83 runs behind. Trescothick has done the bulk of the scoring, more often with cut shots against the seamers and a few sweeps against Simon Kerrigan. There have not been many quick singles. Trescothick already has one century to his name this summer \u2013 against Surrey at the Oval. He has not been at his most fluent here but is battling away expertly. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve encountered anyone who likes playing cricket more. Early on he lost Tim Groenewald, makeshift opener, bowled by Kyle Jarvis; then Tom Abell was caught and bowled off the leading edge by Kerrigan. The left arm-spinner has bowled impeccably, occasionally turning the ball but the surface remains infuriatingly slow. Before lunch there were two impressive overs of wrist-spin from Liam Livingstone, who is enjoying life with a red ball. Clearly he is an exciting cricketer. Before long he will be taking more responsibility than batting seven and bowling a few wrist-spinners. Now leaving stage left in pursuit of a pasty. An excellent morning\u2019s cricket has seen Nottinghamshire turn the game on its head. The lead of 122 was slender at the start of play but by the interval, thanks to Chris Read and Stuart Broad, it had been extended to 270, with 66 overs of the match remaining. Read is still there on 78, a typically determined backs to the wall innings from him, while Broad was eventually well taken by Adam Lyth at second slip having a swish Jack Brooks and the second new ball. But he had made 55 of a seventh wicket stand of 104 in 20 overs. There was some neat hitting from Jake Ball too, who looks to be another of those down the order batsmen who actually has some proper ability. There are fewer bonuses to be picked up by the bowlers these days. The Yorkshire bowling has been very ordinary though, particularly that of Liam Plunkett who may not be as quick as he seems to think he is. Broad in particular gave him some harsh treatment. It will be interesting to see how Ball bowls later this afternoon, but anything like a showing and any hope Plunkett may have of making the squad for the first Test will have gone. It probably already has. Good morning from sunny Taunton, where we wait to see whether we have a taut last night day struggle as Lancashire tenaciously pursue victory or whether Somerset can bat out sedately, shake hands early and escape with another losing draw. Marcus Trescothick is out there with Tim Groenewald, a new opening partner for him. Groenewald, quite logically, was sent out last night since there was just one over to bowl when Somerset, 180 behind, followed on. He was, no doubt, \u201cvolunteered\u201d. In fact he is at his most dangerous when playing his shots. So we will wait and see. Anderson has the new ball and has looked in pretty good rhythm throughout. But he will be hoping for a bit more life in the wicket when he turns up for the Test at Headingley in two weeks\u2019 time. The likeliest venues to produce a victory are currently Canterbury and Trent Bridge \u2026 though Lancashire may have other ideas. It is a glorious warm Trent Bridge morning. Sitting in the press box, early in order to secure a parking spot, I can see contrails criss crossing the sky and the players of both teams warming up in the two nets that stand alongside one another. It is hard to imagine that in any other sport. But cricket, in my experience, has always seemed to transcend the idea that you cannot have interaction. Indeed it has always been an important part of the learning process. I recall vividly a Middlesex match against Kent at Dover. I was struggling a bit for rhythm. It just wasn\u2019t right. Then, at the end of an over, as I was pulling on my sweater, the Kent non-striker, John Shepherd, suggested I shorten my delivery stride a fraction to stand taller. He was spot on. I took five in the second innings, including, of course, Shep. The other week, I went and had a beer in the Tavern with the Middlesex lads. I like to hear how they do things, what they think of players, and they like the tales of how it was. I saw Alan Richardson with them too, the Warwickshire bowling coach, but there were no Warwickshire players in the group. Times have changed, but there is a lot to be learned from talking. We have the makings of a good game here. Notts managed to get themselves back into it with Samit Patel\u2019s batting and Chris Read\u2019s resistance although they will need to crack on way beyond their 122 run lead. If Yorkshire can rattle through the last five wickets then the game is their\u2019s if the weather stays clear."
"10||Julia Roberts's $750,000 day rate is high. But Ving Rhames gets five times that \u2026Garry Marshall\u2019s ensemble comedy Mother\u2019s Day may have been wretchedly received, but its performance at the US box office over the weekend grossed a mere $8.5m. It\u2019s unlikely the film\u2019s starriest key player, Julia Roberts, is much fussed. The Oscar-winner, who only put in four days of work on the picture the Guardian\u2019s Jordan Hoffman called \u201calmost transcendentally terrible\u201d earned a whopping $3m for her reunion with the Pretty Woman director (which works out at $750,000 per day), Variety reported on Sunday. Trades were swift to label her payday \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cobscene.\u201d Her salary, however, simply mirrors the $3m she made for appearing in just six minutes of her previous film with Marshall, 2010\u2019s hit romantic comedy, Valentine\u2019s Day. It\u2019s commonplace for Hollywood to reward A-list actors handsomely for small roles. Charlie Sheen for Scary Movie 5 The actor bookends the fifth instalment in the spoof horror series via two short scenes that took him a single day to shoot. His requested fee: a paltry $250,000. Sheen is no stranger to commanding a hefty sum: during his eighth and final season on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, the actor earned close to $2m an episode. He later claimed he was underpaid. Day rate: $250,000 Sean Connery for Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves Connery reportedly made the same amount for two days spent on set of Kevin Reynolds\u2019 1991 hit, which ended up as the second highest grossing film of that year, trailing Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Despite being 61, Connery was still tasked with playing King Richard, who was 37 at the time of the film\u2019s setting. It\u2019s rumoured that Connery was in fact first offered the juicier role of Lord Locksley (portrayed by Brian Blessed in the film), but turned it down. Day rate: $125,000 Marlon Brando for Superman Long before Roberts\u2019 payday on Mother\u2019s Day raised eyebrows, Marlon Brando courted headlines for receiving what was believed to be the highest amount (per day) ever paid to a performer, for his two weeks of work on Richard Donner\u2019s 1978 blockbuster. For playing the superhero\u2019s father Jor-El, later portrayed by Russell Crowe in Zac Snyder\u2019s 2013 reboot, the late famed actor pocketed $3.7m, a high salary for the period, for around 12 days work. Not bad, considering Brando only appears in a handful of scenes set in Krypton. Day rate: around $300,000 Ving Rhames for Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol As one of only two actors (the other being Tom Cruise) to have appeared in every Mission Impossible film, Ving Rhames is rewarded handsomely for his dedication to the blockbuster franchise. He made only a fleeting appearance in 2011\u2019s fourth instalment, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, but still managed to reportedly snag $7.7m for simply showing up for a couple of days. The amount was significantly higher than the $3.5m he was said to have made for 2006\u2019s Mission: Impossible III. Day rate: around $3.85m Benicio del Toro for American Gangster The Oscar-winner for Traffic trumps all on this list by allegedly netting an enviable sum without putting in a single day\u2019s work on Ridley Scott\u2019s 2007 gangster epic. The actor was attached to the project in its earliest stages, when the story of New York heroine kingpin Frank Lucas was to be told by Training Day director Antoine Fuqua. When Universal cut Fuqua from the project citing \u201ccreative differences,\u201d del Toro walked away with $5m thanks to a pay-or-play contract. He was replaced by Russell Crowe. Day rate: $5m"
"9||Interminable quip-heavy interviews with Noel GallagherA TALE OF TWO CITIES (THREE IF YOU COUNT THE REFERENCE TO COV) Don\u2019t get us wrong. The Fiver is as happy as the next person that Leicester City have won the league. Providing that next person isn\u2019t a supporter of Derby County. Or Coventry City. Or Nottingham Forest, who can\u2019t bang on about 1977-78 being the greatest underdog story of all time any more \u2026 for goodness sake do you need everything, aren\u2019t the two subsequent Big Cups enough? Or they\u2019re getting fed up reading articles about betting odds. Or had assumed they\u2019d seen the back of Kasabian in 2007. Or has been exposed to so many clips of Claudio Ranieri being sweet that they\u2019re risking the onset of type-two diabetes. Or are employed by either Tottenham Hotspur or Chelsea and had gone to the trouble of staging a couple of marvellous 1970s-style bench-emptying brawls only for everyone to forget about them almost immediately. None of those folk are very happy about it at all. Oh the humanity! These poor people can at least take succour from the fact that, in this country, success stories only have so much currency, and at some point everyone will begin to show signs of severe Foxes Fatigue now that the underdogs have entered the mainstream. A feelgood fairytale? No thanks! No thanks! This is Britain! Take Manchester City as an example, for so long everyone\u2019s beloved second team as they bobbed up and down the divisions, flailing around in a hapless but endearing fashion. But these days they\u2019re a source of supreme irritation, winning more than their fair share of trophies, signing all the hottest talent, and giving the editors of Football Focus excuses to run interminable quip-heavy interviews with Noel Gallagher, who we\u2019d otherwise have seen the back of in 2007. However in Europe, City are still considered something of a novelty and, as such, retain a little of their old-school charm. On Wednesday evening they reprise their former role as popular underdogs when they visit Real Madrid for the second leg of their Big Cup semi. Real welcome back Him, who during the first leg in Manchester became trapped in the stand under a ludicrously oversized pair of headphones and was unable to wriggle free. A team of crack civil engineers from RadioShack subsequently released the star, whose side are hot favourites as a result, though Manuel Pellegrini prefers to big up his own talent: \u201cWe have Sergio Ag\u00fcero and I am sure we will see him in a good performance.\u201d The Fiver loves an underdog, so wishes Pellegrini and his men all the best. Though when City subsequently join the European elite after becoming the latest club to deny Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in absurdly cruel fashion in the final, we\u2019ll almost certainly lose interest. A success story? A feelgood fairytale? No thanks! No thanks!

FIVER LETTERS \u201cFollowing Bayern\u2019s defeat to Atl\u00e9tico, I was pondering the similarities between Pep Guardiola and the soon-to-be-ex-Queen\u2019s Celtic\u2019s Ronny Deila.

He fumed: \u201cI have since heard about it and obviously wasn\u2019t happy about it.

"23||Survival of the fattest: how greedy labradors convinced us they were cleverName: Labrador. Age: Exactly 100, if we go by when the breed club was formed in the UK, although they are at least a century older than that. Appearance: Barrel chest, floppy ears, pleading eyes. Typically black, yellow or chocolate-coloured. Like to hunt, swim and play with toilet rolls. Misnomer: Labradors don\u2019t come from the Canadian province of Labrador. They come from the Canadian island of Newfoundland \u2013 part of the same province \u2013 and are derived from the St John\u2019s water dog. Most popular dogs in the world, aren\u2019t they? They are indeed. More than twice as popular as any other breed in the UK and the US. And the cleverest? Depends how you look at it. Stanley Coren\u2019s 1994 book The Intelligence of Dogs ranked them seventh \u2013 border collies were top \u2013 and new research suggests their intelligence and trainability as assistance dogs are mainly the result of their love of food. Don\u2019t all dogs love food? Maybe, but a team of scientists at the University of Cambridge has shown that many labradors are genetically incapable of stopping themselves eating. Those most disposed to eat are also the ones that learn to perform tasks fastest, because food is used as an incentive. Your grasp of the science seems a bit vague. It\u2019s something to do with a bit of the POMC gene having been deleted. Why did the POMC gene get deleted? Possibly because among St John\u2019s water dogs \u2013 which were used to retrieve nets, ropes and fish from the sea \u2013 eating enormous amounts conferred a genetic advantage. Survival of the fattest. So, obesity is good for you? Only if you spend your life retrieving nets in freezing seas. Three famous labradors: Injured serviceman Allen Parton\u2019s assistance dog Endal, whose party trick was to operate a cash machine. David Blunkett\u2019s guide dog Lucy, whose political astuteness was so great she once threw up in the House of Commons during a speech by David Willetts. Omar Riviera\u2019s guide dog Dorado, who was with his owner on the 71st floor of the north tower at the World Trade Center on 9/11. He stayed calm among the chaos and led Riviera to safety. Most likely to say: \u201cWoof, woof.\u201d Least likely to say: \u201cI think I\u2019ll pass on the second helpings.\u201d"
"7||Golf tour pros love Donald Trump but loathe Hillary Clinton, poll revealsIt\u2019s probably no shock to learn that most US golfers tend to vote Republican \u2013 but the strength of ill feeling towards Hillary Clinton is perhaps more surprising, particularly among the women of the LPGA. Oh, and the game\u2019s greats also like Donald Trump \u2013 and think Tiger Woods will win again. The revelations come from Sports Illustrated\u2019s annual anonymous pro tour survey, published on Tuesday, where golfers can sound off on multiple topics without being unmasked. SI polled more than 150 players across three American tours, and, unsurprisingly, a strongly Republican bent emerged from the survey. Forty-four percent of LPGA Tour players said they will not be voting for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, against 33% who will be, and 23% who gave no response. \u201cAbsolutely fucking not,\u201d opined one anonymous responder. Players on the men\u2019s tours were asked: \u201cIf Clinton could guarantee to cut your taxes in half and the Republican candidate would keep them the same, would you vote for her?\u201d Fifty-six percent of PGA players said no, while a massive 74% of players on the Champions Tour \u2013 the tour for players aged 50 and over \u2013 said the same. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t vote for [Clinton] if she were the last person on Earth,\u201d said one older gentleman. But there was no such problem for Donald Trump, whose various misdeeds didn\u2019t seem to bother the golfers profiled in the survey. Sixty-seven percent of players on the women\u2019s tour said that the LPGA should hold tournaments on courses owned by Donald Trump, while 45% of players on the PGA Tour, and 88% of players on the Champions Tour, didn\u2019t think the WGC-Cadillac should be moved from the Trump National Doral resort in Miami because of the Republican frontrunner\u2019s controversial \u2013 nay, offensive \u2013 positions on women, immigration and race. \u201cNo,\u201d said one player. \u201cI love that golf course.\u201d Thirty-four percent of Champions Tour players are supporting Trump in the Republican primaries, 22% are undecided, 12% are going for Kasich, and 10% will be disappointed now Ted Cruz has suspended his campaign. Only 22% of Champions Tour players answered \u201cnone\u201d, while one player said he\u2019d be voting for \u201canyone who can beat a Democrat.\u201d Among the other themes that emerged: Adam Scott has the PGA Tour\u2019s prettiest swing. Players\u2019 caddies on balance deserve 10% of the winner\u2019s check. Phil Mickelson would make a better Ryder Cup captain than Woods. Jordan Spieth is held in slightly higher regard than Rory McIlroy. Also, the players remained positive about the fortunes of the game\u2019s biggest names. Sixty-four percent of LPGA players believe Michelle Wie will win another major, while 42% of PGA players feel Woods will win another PGA event, compared to 27% who don\u2019t. Having said that, one player did say: \u201cI\u2019m optimistic, but running out of reasons.\u201d"
"15||How the other half fly: what air rage tells us about inequalityThis lunchtime, at prime minister\u2019s questions, Jeremy Corbyn did his best to escape the grinding tit-for-tat on racism by challenging David Cameron on inequality. If only he\u2019d had the research of Katherine DeCelles to hand. Decelles, a scientist at Princeton, has just published some very telling research that illustrates the broader social costs of unequal treatment by focusing on a very specific instance. She looked at what happens when those travelling in economy class on a plane pass through the first-class section on the way to their seat, and found that this encouraged bad behaviour. Who can suppress a twinge of sympathy? But that wasn\u2019t the really interesting finding. Much less predictable was the discovery that when economy-class travellers have shuffled past the luxurious first-class seats on their way to the back of the plane, first-class travellers become more badly behaved too. In fact, since the research did not weight the incidents of air rage by the proportion of rude travellers to well-behaved ones in any given part of the plane, it\u2019s possible the first-class traveller is just as prone to raging at the cabin crew as the one in economy, when \u2013 and this is the bit that matters \u2013 they both are made unavoidably aware of the difference in their status. Where a group is made to feel underprivileged, they resent it. Who wouldn\u2019t? But when a group is encouraged to feel entitled, what the study calls \u201chigher-class people\u201d become as likely to behave inconsiderately as anyone else. If it was just about the market, the response to this research would be to introduce even more, and more stringent, segregation. Oddly, that\u2019s just what has been happening. The world has grown familiar with economy airlines, but it turns out there are also whole planes full only of first-class travellers too, flights where the size of your hand luggage is much less of an issue than the size of your expense account. Once you start looking, segregation is happening everywhere. Inequality in Britain, on the face of it, has been narrower for most of the past five years than it was in the boom years of the early noughties. But privileged access is creeping insidiously across what were once shared experiences, and into what used to be considered public goods. In London, squares and parks that were once open spaces are, more and more often, privately owned and managed. Even the royal parks in central London have to generate income by fencing off acres for concerts and fairs where you must pay to go in. The garden bridge vanity project across the Thames, which now seems to be unstoppable, will be a private space, even though it has been backed by \u00a360m of public money. The gated community is becoming an expression of entitlement. So-called affordable housing, incorporated into new high-rise flats as a quid pro quo for planning permission, has separate entrances for the poor and the rich. At least that should avoid lobby rage. The researchers at Princeton analysed air rage incidents because they were interested in whether it\u2019s possible to shape the physical environment so that bad behaviour is designed out of it. They were less concerned with the wider costs of inequality. But that doesn\u2019t stop their findings brilliantly revealing how perceptions of inequality undermine social wellbeing. They have come up with a kind of micro truth about unequal societies that is as revealing about the 21st century as Jane Austen\u2019s universal truth about rich men and marriage was about women\u2019s status in the early 19th century. The relationship between inequality, poverty and happiness has faded from the political limelight in the years of austerity. But when David Cameron was still trying to sweeten the Conservative image, he promised to introduce a happiness index. He has started talking about it again recently. It\u2019s probably time he travelled in the back of the plane, to consider the view from there."
"2||Man jailed over Libor seeks 'miscarriage of justice' reviewTom Hayes, serving 11 years for rigging Libor rates, has hired a high-profile lawyer to take his appeal to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice. The 36-year-old\u2019s attempt to have his conviction overturned failed although three senior court of appeal judges reduced the sentence from 14 years. He has now hired Karen Todner \u2013 who led Gary McKinnon\u2019s case against extradiction to the US on charges of computer hacking \u2013 to present a case to the CCRC. Todner, head of crime, regulatory and extradition at Kaim Todner, said: \u201cBecause Tom has already appealed his conviction and sentence, the Criminal Cases Review Commission is now Tom\u2019s only hope of achieving justice. \u201cTom\u2019s family are now in possession of fresh evidence. We believe Tom has a strong case, which our submission to the CCRC will demonstrate,\u201d said Todner. In August, Hayes was found guilty of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. He was diagnosed with mild Asperger\u2019s syndrome shortly before his 10-week trial last May. Hayes\u2019s family said: \u201cKaren has longstanding expertise in the areas where Tom\u2019s case needs urgent review in order to right this wrong. Tom knew from the moment he met Karen that she understands him and the way he thinks, and that is the single most important thing to him.\u201d It was not immediately clear what fresh evidence had been found but Hayes and his supporters are seeking to raise up to \u00a3150,000 via crowdfunding. So far \u00a32,135 has been raised on FundRazr. Hayes, who is in Belmarsh prison, has been ordered to pay \u00a3878,806 after a ruling in the Old Bailey that the money was the proceeds of crime. The Serious Fraud Office was seeking up to \u00a32.45m from Hayes."
"11||Bitcoin: Craig Wright promises new evidence to prove identityCraig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who claims to have created the cryptocurrency bitcoin in 2008 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, has promised to provide fresh evidence to back up his claim. In a blogpost on his website, Wright says \u201cover the coming days, I will be hosting a series of pieces that will lay the foundations for this extraordinary claim\u201d, including transferring bitcoin from \u201can early block\u201d and posting \u201cindependently verifiable documents\u201d. \u201cYou should be sceptical. You should question. I would,\u201d Wright adds, concluding: \u201cI will present what I believe to be \u2018extraordinary proof\u2019 and ask only that it be independently validated. Ultimately, I can do no more than that.\u201d When he first publicly claimed to be Nakamoto, in interviews with the BBC, Economist and GQ Magazine, Wright promised to post proof on his website. But the material he posted was far from convincing for many experts: most damningly, the cryptographic evidence appeared to have been directly copied from a 2009 bitcoin transaction. Wright\u2019s promise of further proof doesn\u2019t address the oddities in his original blogpost, except for obliquely claiming that he would post evidence \u201caddressing some of the false allegations that have been levelled\u201d. But for some of his original supporters, those discrepancies are already enough to prompt disavowals of Wright\u2019s claims. Gavin Andresen, formerly the chief scientist at the currency\u2019s guiding body, the Bitcoin Foundation, had been the most important backer of the man who would be Satoshi. All the initial reports cited Andresen\u2019s belief of Wright, which was based on a private demonstration in April, as an important point in his favour. But following Wright\u2019s bizarre initial blogpost, Andresen expressed doubt, telling security researcher Dan Kaminsky: \u201cI was as surprised by the \u2018proof\u2019 as anyone, and don\u2019t yet know exactly what is going on.\u201d \u201cIt was a mistake to agree to publish my post before I saw his \u2013 I assumed his post would simply be a signed message anybody could easily verify,\u201d he added. \u201cOF COURSE he should just publish a signed message or (equivalently) move some [bitcoin] through the key associated with an early block.\u201d For some, such as academic Zeynep Tefekci, even the evidence Wright is now promising may not be enough to overcome the doubts instilled by his initially underwhelming evidence. Moving bitcoin from an \u201cearly block\u201d, for instance, would only conclusively prove that Wright held the private keys of Nakamoto if the block was the very first one made: the so-called \u201cgenesis block\u201d, containing the first 50 bitcoins ever mined. In his latest post, Wright wrote at least one thing that everyone can agree with. \u201cFor some there is no burden of proof high enough, no evidence that cannot be dismissed as fabrication or manipulation.\u201d"
"15||The TTIP and TPP trade deals: enough of the secrecyIt\u2019s amazing how just a little transparency forced onto the free trade deals the Obama administration been negotiating in secret totally turns the public against them. After the contents of the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the US and the European Union was leaked and published by Greenpeace a few days ago, the negotiations \u2013 already in turmoil \u2013 have been thrown into further doubt now that the public has actually gotten to see what is being proposed by both sides. As usual with US-negotiated trade deals, the contents were kept completely secret from both ordinary Europeans and Americans, yet was easily accessible if you\u2019re a giant corporation. So naturally, the terms are heavily tilted toward big business at the expense of the environment, health and safety standards. The Guardian reported on a lot of controversial provisions in detail on Sunday, but the Independent summed it up nicely: \u201cThe documents show that US corporations will be granted unprecedented powers over any new public health or safety regulations to be introduced in future. If any European government does dare to bring in laws to raise social or environmental standards, TTIP will grant US investors the right to sue for loss of profits.\u201d Despite the Obama administration\u2019s concerted push to finish both TTIP and its Asian counterpart, the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), before the presidential election in November, support for trade deals are plummeting in the US: a recent poll showed that only 18% of the public support TTIP, compared to 53% in 2014. One can only assume that the presidential race has drastically increased the number of people with a negative opinion of free trade deals. Both parties\u2019 potential nominees actively campaigning against them, after all. Republican nominee Donald Trump has been vocal in his opposition to TPP since the start of his candidacy, and Democratic contender Bernie Sanders hit frontrunner Hillary Clinton so hard on supporting past trade deals for costing the US manufacturing jobs and weakening environment standards that she came out against TPP as well \u2013 despite supporting it while at the state department. But what has mattered more is merely the ability for the public to see what\u2019s in these agreements. While there were many civil society groups protesting the deals from the start, it wasn\u2019t until WikiLeaks published draft versions of TPP that public sentiment turned against it. The US trade representative even admitted at the time that the administration knew if the public found out what is in these trade deals, public opposition would be significant. What progressive champion Senator Elizabeth Warren said then is even more true now: \u201cIf transparency would lead to widespread public opposition to a trade agreement, then that trade agreement should not be the policy of the United States.\u201d Yet that doesn\u2019t seem to be the position of the \u201cmost transparent administration ever\u201d. While lobbyists are given a free hand to help write the deals, even members of legislative bodies have to jump through absurd hoops just to lay eyes on the document. Draconian restrictions were put on US members of Congress if they wanted to view TPP while it was in negotiation, so much so that they were even threatened with prosecution if they talked about it. And Time magazine just reported on what Katja Kipping, a member of German parliament, had to do to see the latest version of TTIP. This included agreeing to a restricted reading time of just two hours, having a guard breathing down her neck the entire time and not sharing the contents of the agreement with anyone. If the Obama administration wants to publicly push for free trade deals despite the growing public opposition to them, that\u2019s their prerogative. But Congress and the public should have full access to their contents when they\u2019re being negotiated and the Obama administration should stop treating decisions that affect the jobs of millions of Americans as if they are some sort of national security secret. But since they refused to be transparent, the deals should be rejected entirely."

"31||What is local government and how can you get involved?What exactly is local government? It\u2019s a difficult one to sum up: there are several tiers, and the structure of those tiers is not the same in every part of England. Each level is formed by a democratically elected body generally funded through a combination of business rates, central government grants and council tax. You can find out which levels of local government exist in your area. Here\u2019s a quick guide to how it all works across the country. If you live in, or close to, a city If you live in London, you will have a London borough council such as Lambeth or Camden. If you live in a large city that isn\u2019t London, such as Liverpool, your local government body might take the form of a metropolitan borough council. These cover places like Birmingham and Leeds. If you live in the countryside In some rural or semi-rural parts of England, local government is split between a county council and a district council. County councils cover large areas, such as Gloucestershire or Cornwall, and provide most but not all services for that area \u2013 think libraries, council housing and some roads. District councils cover smaller areas and provide more localised services. These councils can shift and form a single level of government, known as a unitary council. For an example look at \u201cCoxit\u201d \u2013 the plan for Cotswold district council to join forces with West Oxfordshire and form a unitary authority, not under Gloucestershire county council control. The new arrangements have consequences: if local government borders are redrawn it\u2019s unclear where Gloucestershire constabulary and Thames Valley Police patches would be. Would Gloucestershire residents be safe in their beds with Thames Valley Police on the case? Probably. But it would make a mess of the 5 May police and crime commissioner elections. If you\u2019re somewhere in between You might live under a unitary authority. So instead of the two tier system (county, and then district) there\u2019s just the one authority. Reading is an example: the authority might do refuse collections, run your library and provide council housing. If you\u2019re really awkward and you live in an area that\u2019s had extra devolved powers Greater Manchester (a city region) now has a combined authority (the Greater Manchester combined authority, or GMCA). This adds an extra layer below central government, which holds some of the powers traditionally retained in Westminster. The GMCA covers the area of 10 local councils, including Wigan and Bolton. You could, for example, be represented by both the GMCA and Wigan council. The tier below: parish councils Community, town and parish councils are often collectively referred to as parish councils. The UK has around 10,000 of these, which form the most local level of local government in England, but only around a third of people in England have a parish or town council in their area. Parish councils \u2013 not to be confused with church parishes, which have been separate for over a century \u2013 are often responsible for items such as allotments, community centres, cemeteries and parks. And, of course, public clocks. Depending on the size of the population, parish council elections can take place in several wards (small subsections of the area) with residents in each ward electing a representative. The principle is the same as for electing a constituency MP. These parish councils meet with their fair share of controversy. Stoke Gifford parish council recently hit the news when it suggested parkrun participants be charged for using the local park. How do you get involved with your parish council? Just as with county or district councils, if there\u2019s a parish council in your area you can vote, or stand for election as a councillor. Elections for parish or town councils take place every four years but vacancies sometimes come up more regularly (these by-elections are called casual vacancies \u2013 like in JK Rowling\u2019s book), so it\u2019s worth checking local papers as they often report them when they arise. Can you set up your own? Yes. You need to define the boundaries of where you plan to have a new council and get the support, via a petition, of people able to vote in elections (known as electors) in your area. The exact percentage depends on the number of people in your area. There\u2019s more detail on the precise numbers needed here. If your petition gets enough signatures you can submit it to the principal authority (probably the county or borough council) in your area, which will will carry out what\u2019s called a community governance review. The next step is for the authority to consult residents, decide yes or no, and if your plan gets the green light it will announce a date for elections. St Austell town council in Cornwall is an example of how this process can work [pdf].

"20||Danny Goffey's playlist: Little Simz, Elliott Smith and moreElliott Smith \u2013 Angeles I love Elliott Smith. His voice is so real and fragile. There is a great live clip of this song, in which he forgets the lyrics, stops and swears. Everyone in the crowd laughs and whoops and he smiles. But then it goes quiet and he just looks so lonely, like he wants to cry. I wish I\u2019d met him. The Beat \u2013 Mirror in the Bathroom Gaz [Coombes] and I covered this song as the Hot Rats on our album Turn Ons. I love the deadpan delivery and the punky dance riffs and hooks. Midlake \u2013 Roscoe There is something about the production of this song that is fantastic. The closeness of the recording sounds good on any sound system. Although it is full of dreamy harmonies, it still retains a menacing hardness in its sound. Little Simz \u2013 Wings I saw her on Jools Holland last year performing this song and I instantly thought she was great. She has a real presence and individuality. A Curious Tale of Trials and Persons is a beast of a debut. Jimi Hendrix \u2013 All Along the Watchtower Whenever I need a musical shot in the arm, this never fails to deliver. The instrumentation on it is almost otherworldly and totally crosses all rock\u2019n\u2019roll, punk and dance boundaries. Jimi played the bass on this and it\u2019s totally bonkers! Mitch Mitchell is my favourite drummer and this is him at his best."
"6||15 Million Degrees: A Journey to the Centre of the Sun by Lucie Green \u2013 review\r\nWe rarely look directly at it but we miss it when we can\u2019t see it. If it wasn\u2019t there at all, we\u2019d be gone too. It delivers the food we eat, the air we breathe, the clothes we wear. We read by its light \u2013 on a screen, on paper, indoors or out \u2013 because it is the ultimate energy source: indeed, the only energy source. It powered the primeval forests of carboniferous ferns and conifers that became our fossil fuel just as it drives the winds for the electrical turbines that must one day replace coal and oil. Even the radioactive elements whose decay and fission keep the planet alive and self-renewing are stellar confections: fragments first forged in, and then recycled by supernovae, exploding giant suns. That lucky old sun, the great Louis Armstrong sang, \u201chas nothing to do but roll around heaven all day\u201d. In fact, it is the only thing in the solar system that really works hard: every second it converts 600m tonnes of hydrogen to 596m tonnes of helium and those missing 4m tonnes become the energy released by the thermonuclear reaction: a bonus of electromagnetic radiation distributed across the entire solar system. A trifling 2 billionth of this highlights one side of the spinning Earth, delivering energy at the rate of 1,361 joules per square metre. This is the caloric power a hungry human might derive from a mere crumb, a tenth of a gram of a commercially marketed corn chip, says Lucie Green helpfully. But this planetary nourishment arrives every second to every square metre and from this shining moment all else follows: everything that has ever lived, every evolutionary advance, every human conceit, every sensory pleasure, and every book, including this one. And you can read this only because printer\u2019s ink absorbs visible light and bleached paper reflects it \u2013 both of these of the sun\u2019s making. But the light that hits the page \u2013 in this story of research in progress \u2013 seems a strangely haphazard agency. It begins in the heart of the sun, in a ball of matter 133,000 times the mass of the Earth, so crushed by its own gravitational force that it has 10 times the density of lead, 2.5bn times the pressure of air, and is hot enough to shred atoms: they become plasma, the fourth state of matter, a swirl of electrons and protons. (In 1993 the band They Might Be Giants recorded a cover of \u201cWhy Does the Sun Shine?\u201d, which contains the line: \u201cThe sun is a mass of incandescent gas.\u201d Sixteen years later, they wrote a companion song that updated it to \u201cThe sun is a miasma of incandescent plasma\u201d.) In this vast furnace, 15m C at its core, the highly improbable can happen: just give it time. Protons collide and, once every 100bn collisions, overcome their resistance to each other, perform a complex three-step dance of union, and become a helium-3 nucleus, releasing two neutrinos and two gamma ray photons in the process. The neutrinos instantly make the journey from the sun\u2019s core to the cosmos at the speed of light, and every second 100bn of these pass through matter the size of a human fingertip as if it wasn\u2019t there. But the gamma ray photons can barely travel a millimetre before smashing into electrons, to be scattered and bounced back, losing a tiny bit of energy in the process. This bashing and scattering happens an estimated 10 million billion billion times as the photons find their way to the surface of the sun: a distance of 500m km. What begins as a laborious struggle through ultra-dense plasma becomes a mere obstacle race through the cooler zones where atoms can survive, and the light by which you read this is finally released by yet another freak of solar physics. A high energy photon is absorbed by a negative hydrogen ion which bubbles nearer to the surface at about a kilometre a second to release \u2013 at last \u2013 a photon of light in the visible spectrum that can make a dash to Earth\u2019s surface in around eight minutes. Negative hydrogen ions midwife 95% of the sun\u2019s visible light, and for every 100m hydrogen atoms in the sun\u2019s photosphere, there is only one negative hydrogen ion. \u201cThe sun seems to be driven by some extremely unlikely processes,\u201d Green writes. \u201cBut, of course, the sheer scale of the sun makes these things possible.\u201d None of these happenings can be empirically tested, and very little can be observed directly: the whole story has had to be assembled by inference and conjecture, cautious observation and some serious mathematical physics, from the first sight of sunspots to the launch of space-based solar observatories. It is a story with its heroes and heroines: one of the latter is Annie Jump Cannon, recruited by Harvard in the 19th century as a computer (the word originally described a person who computed) to classify stars from their spectra: she categorised 250,000 in a lifetime. Another was Cecilia Payne, first at Cambridge and then Harvard, the first astronomer to make an accurate estimation of the sun\u2019s chemical composition, although the men around her wouldn\u2019t accept her results. Green is herself a solar physicist and TV presenter and this book tells a luminous story with (what other phrase could one use?) a light touch. The account embraces both the making of the solar system from a cloud of swirling gas and dust, and the sun\u2019s probable end first as a red giant, and then as a white dwarf, fading to oblivion in a slow, billion-year extinction. But the real thrill is in the incomplete unfolding story: of the puzzles set by coronal mass ejections, those great million-mile-an-hour blasts of stellar fabric that light up the aurorae, pound spacecraft and once, in 1859, set telegraph equipment ablaze. The narrative encompasses the piecemeal answers delivered periodically by eclipses, the measurements of the sun\u2019s extraordinary magnetic field, the strange resonances within the sun that triggered a new science called helioseismology, and the continuing discoveries of the marvellous Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977, and now at or perhaps beyond the furthest outposts of the empire of the sun. And, in the next two years, the European Space Agency and Nasa will each launch a space mission to observe the making of the solar wind, while Voyager 1 and 2 are still feebly relaying signals from the furthest edge. \u201cFor the first time the beginning and the end of the heliosphere will be studied simultaneously,\u201d Green says. \u201cI cannot imagine that this will ever happen again.\u201d \u2022 To order 15 Million Degrees for \u00a315.19 (RRP \u00a318.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

"29||David Attenborough at 90: a TV legend\u2019s top 10 momentsTo celebrate Sir David Attenborough\u2019s 90th birthday on 8 May, wildlife television producer Stephen Moss has chosen his top 10 TV moments featuring the great man. Enjoy. 1. Lyrebird mimicking a camera and chainsaw (The Life of Birds, 1998) Even Sir David is astonished when this Australian forest-dweller perfectly imitates not only a camera shutter but also its motor drive. However, hilarity soon turns to concern when the bird then mimics the sound of a chainsaw cutting down the threatened forest habitat where it lives. This was the winner of a national viewer poll, held in 2008, to choose the best Attenborough clips of all time. 2. Blue whale surfacing by his boat (The Life of Mammals, 2002) Often assumed to feature in the ocean-going epic The Blue Planet, this actually appeared a year later in the landmark series The Life of Mammals. Once again, Attenborough can hardly contain his glee as this mighty marine mammal surfaces next to his tiny craft and then dives, its huge tail eventually disappearing beneath the waves. 3. Chimps wading (The Life of Mammals, 2002) Attenborough dons chest waders to enter an African swamp, where a troop of chimpanzees are also walking, holding their arms aloft to avoid getting them wet. 4. Calling a woodpecker to camera (The Life of Birds, 1998) Exploiting the innate curiosity of a male bird that thinks a rival has invaded his territory, Attenborough bangs loudly on the trunk of a tree on Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of South America. Sure enough, the Magellanic woodpecker responds immediately, perching right above the presenter\u2019s head and banging the tree even harder. 5. Being knocked over by a Capercaillie (The Life of Birds, 1998) The world\u2019s largest species of grouse \u2013 roughly the size and shape of a turkey \u2013 is more than a match for any TV presenter. As Attenborough enters its territory in the Caledonian pine forest of the Scottish Highlands, this normally shy bird goes straight for his knees, knocking him right over. 6. Falling down a snowy slope (Life on Earth, 1979) While demonstrating the colour of the snow, Attenborough slips, sliding several yards down a mountainside. Fortunately, he\u2019s unhurt. This clip was later shown as part of a montage of outtakes in the autobiographical programme Life on Air. 7. Saying \u2018boo\u2019 to a sloth (The Life of Mammals, 2002) Attenborough ditches his trademark soft whisper and climbs a tree in the South American rainforest to say boo to a sloth, a creature he refers to as \u201ca mobile compost heap\u201d. After the initial laugh, he tells the audience fascinating facts about the animal\u2019s behaviour \u2013 revealing, for example, that this slow, vulnerable mammal chooses to defecate on the forest floor. 8. Meeting a tribe of cannibals (Zoo Quest, 1950s) A slim, youthful Attenborough ventures into the jungles of Papua New Guinea, where he comes across a group of cannibals. He later recounted the story on Michael Parkinson\u2019s chatshow \u2013 including the moment when he noticed the glint of a knife, followed by a large group of men rushing towards him: \u201cTo say I was alarmed is putting it mildly.\u201d Putting aside any anxiety, he walks towards them and says, with typically British self-confidence: \u201cGood afternoon!\u201d To his great relief, they greet him with friendly enthusiasm. 9. Warning the world (State of the Planet, 2000) Standing in front of the great statues of Easter Island, Attenborough delivers his most powerful warning yet: if we continue to follow the example of the doomed Rapa Nui civilisation, which exploited the natural resources of this Pacific island until its society collapsed, we will all face the same fate. 10. Sharing a moment with mountain gorillas (Life on Earth, 1979) This is surely the most famous of all Attenborough clips, yet it almost never saw the light of day. Rumour has it that Attenborough\u2019s producer was so annoyed that he had gone off the prepared script that he threatened to drop the sequence from the finished programme. Fortunately, when he saw the footage, he had a change of heart. The extraordinary meeting of minds was summed up best by Attenborough\u2019s ad-lib: \u201cThere is more meaning and mutual understanding in exchanging a glance with a gorilla than any other animal I know.\u201d Stephen Moss\u2019s latest book, Wild Kingdom: Bringing Back Britain\u2019s Wildlife, is published on 7 April (Square Peg, \u00a316.99)"
"19||Patrick Harvie: Scottish Greens will push the SNP beyond their comfort zoneIt\u2019s a party that triumphed in the aftermath of the Scottish independence referendum, despite losing the vote, enjoying a five-fold surge in membership and a flood of eager activists. It\u2019s now on the brink of its best-ever Holyrood election result, with the word from the doorstep that it is picking off progressive voters from Scottish Labour. But this isn\u2019t the SNP. Patrick Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, is first to admit that the past months have presented an entirely new campaigning experience. Most of the young activists knocking on doors for him in Glasgow Kelvin, where the Guardian joined them last week, signed up immediately after the no vote in September 2014. Harvie is one of two Green candidates standing for a constituency seat in this election: another sign of the party\u2019s confidence. The Scottish Greens are hoping to win at least one MSP in every region, with the potential for a couple more along to way, particularly if the support around Glasgow holds up. The local organiser proudly shows off his new app for recording canvas results: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve not had spread sheets!\u201d Here the pitch is to yes voters who may consider the SNP to be on a shoogly peg, say, on taxing the wealthy, who are still too defined by the constitutional question to return to Labour, but see the Greens as a way of maintaining pressure on the nationalists to match their progressive words with progressive deeds. \u201cBold\u201d is the word the Harvie uses when he talks about \u201cpushing the SNP beyond their comfort zone\u201d. At the same time, he is clear that the Greens favour \u201cconstructive opposition\u201d. Harvey has a delicate balance to strike, reflecting the dismay felt by more radical voters for example when Nicola Sturgeon rejected a new 50p top tax rate, but without resorting to corrosive SNP-bashing. Harvie offers a very specific example of the greening of the SNP: \u201cI would like to think that the pressure we brought for a good two years to get Alex Salmond to kick Donald Trump out of the Global Scot network had an effect. Eventually after Nicola had taken over she did. I like to think we can get the same result in saying that tax exiles shouldn\u2019t be appointed to the Council of Economic Advisers.\u201d (Harvie has been a long-time critic of the Monacco-based billionaire Jim McColl, and renewed his calls for him to be dropped in light of the Panama Papers data leak.) \u201cI\u2019d like to think Nicola would take a more principled stance,\u201d he concludes. His language when referring to the SNP is emollient - he gently tells me off for suggesting that he \u201cskewered\u201d Sturgeon over council tax in one of the TV debates - and he is doubtless mindful that many SNP voters are in the process of considering whether to give the Greens their second regional vote. At the Scottish Greens\u2019 manifesto launch, Harvie promised that taxing the rich to prevent spending cuts would be \u201cagenda item one\u201d if the SNP invited his party into talks after the election. In contrast with the SNP, the SGP has proposed a 60p upper tax band for earnings over \u00a3150,000, as well as a new residential property tax incorporating land value for the first time, to replace the council tax. The SNP has said it will end the nine-year freeze on council tax but not undertake more fundamental reform called for by local councils. It is here that Harvie\u2019s exasperation with the SNP\u2019s apparent timidity is plain. \u201cI do find it frustrating that three elections in a row there\u2019s been a debate about whether to scrap council tax and have something fundamentally better. Now they\u2019ve got the political capital and the political cover that come with having most other parties wanting to replace the council tax as well, and suddenly they\u2019ve got cold feet.\u201d And he offers his own explanation: \u201cIt\u2019s possible that it\u2019s a feature of having grown too big. If you\u2019ve managed to achieve a single party majority under a PR system, yes that\u2019s hugely impressive but it then makes you much more anxious to keep on doing the same thing again, which means being all things to all people. Any replacement to the council tax would have losers as well as winner.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon has cited fears that top earners would vacate the country if the top rate of tax was raised, but Harvie is blunt: \u201cIf a small number of them are motivated solely by money, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an immense loss.\u201d He continues: \u201cTax policy isn\u2019t just about raising revenue; it\u2019s about the distribution of wealth and income in our society and there is good evidence from around the world that having a high top rate of tax suppresses excessive pay demands by the super-rich.\u201d On emissions, he is equally sharp \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ve got four missed targets in a row and now the SNP\u2019s approach is to raise the targets again. Yet there is no clear programme of action.\u201d He says that he has no concerns about shouting from the sidelines even if the SNP, as predicted, win another majority: \u201cI think that could have been a concern at the beginning of the last session. I was disappointed only to get two seats again. But what we did was get results - on energy efficiency, land reform, the fracking moratorium. It\u2019s not enough and we\u2019ll be able to do more if people have that sense of boldness and elect a parliament with a good strong group of Green MSPs.\u201d \u201cCan you think of anything more likely to make a land reform minister raise their game than seeing [land reform expert, second on the Lothian list] Andy Wightman on the other side of the committee table?\u201d he asks with evident anticipation."
"20||Beyonc\u00e9 Bodies: Lemonade video inspires sold-out dance classesLess than two weeks after the release of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, the new visual album has already inspired its own sold-out Manhattan dance class \u2013 complete with fans in themed costumes from the film. Inspired by Serena Williams\u2019 twerking next to Beyonc\u00e9 in the Sorry video, Ranese Southerland, 28, dressed like a ballerina warrior in an all-black tutu, bodysuit and combat boots to the Monday night Beyonc\u00e9 class at Broadway Bodies, a dance studio in Chelsea. Southerland said it took an email chain with 23 replies to work out what she and her other \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 Bodies\u201d class friends were going to wear. \u201cI don\u2019t put that much effort into what I wear to work,\u201d said Southerland, a sales associate for a New York venue. But Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 and the Beyonc\u00e9 classes, which have been running at Broadway Bodies for four years \u2013 inspires this kind of devotion. One attendee wore a black top with \u201cI ain\u2019t sorry\u201d marked in white around the neckline, while another painted her face with white dots, like the dancers in the video. Kate Goldwater, 32, wore a mustard yellow tiered ruffle dress, inspired by Hold Up, the video where Beyonce saunters around smashing cars with a baseball bat while wearing a similar gown. \u201cThis is my favorite look from the video so I recreated it out of a tablecloth and old T-shirts,\u201d said Goldwater, a fashion designer who owns a vintage clothing store in Manhattan\u2019s East Village. Goldwater says as soon as the album dropped, social media started buzzing with class regulars like herself discussing the album, declaring: \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s an emergency, we have to call an emergency class. So we all registered right away.\u201d Sorry, the fourth track on the album, was voted on by class regulars as the first song from Lemonade to be used. Sorry is flicking-the-bird-furious Beyonc\u00e9. It\u2019s a song about getting drunk with your girlfriends (on your cheating husband\u2019s Cognac brand, natch) and declaring \u201cI ain\u2019t thinking \u2019bout you\u201d and \u201cboy, bye\u201d. Dance teacher Alistair Williams, 30, the executive director of Broadway Bodies, declares the room a \u201cshame-free\u201d zone. The crowd was mostly in their twenties and thirties and the majority were women, but a few Beyonc\u00e9-loving fellas also participated. Enrollment has spiked since the release of Lemonade, said Williams, with this first Sorry class selling out in three days. Next week is sold out, with only a few tickets available for the following week\u2019s new Hold Up class. The new album is a boon for business. Choreography is modeled on the video and adapted by Williams and his team. For this Beyonc\u00e9 song in particular he\u2019s allowing \u201ccommunity choreography\u201d, asking students to help come up with the best moves to rejig the dance each week. \u201cOf course I cheated, I looked at the Formation tour videos that are on Facebook and stole some of those moves,\u201d said Williams. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation tour launched in Miami last week. The Sorry dance itself involves enough body rolls to get you sweaty but is bearable for a beginner to learn in 45 minutes. There\u2019s a lot of laughing and clapping, a high-energy class that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. When Beyonc\u00e9 screams \u201cSuck on my balls, pause, I\u2019ve had enough\u201d, we cross one arm in front of the other and thrust our hips forward. \u201cI want everyone to unleash their inner \u2018fuck you\u2019,\u201d declared Williams. When Beyonc\u00e9 declares \u201cmiddle fingers up\u201d, we do it. It\u2019s fun playing the character of Beyonc\u00e9, luxuriating in the spurned woman turned girl power moves."
"27||Rising star 2015 -2016 competition entry: Jenny FaulknerGregory Mandry, managing director of The Big Yellow Feet Production Company, explains why Jenny Faulkner, production manager, should win the Rising Star category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition: Jenny started out as an actor and voiceover artist in a number of our productions but soon made the transition to the \u2018other side\u2019 of the camera when a position in our company became available. Since joining our company, less than two years ago, Jenny has firmly made her mark on our business. As production manager Jenny has taken on and overseen a number of our projects, showing natural leadership in her day-to-day account management and production management work and has even managed to secure us valuable new contracts. She has taken it upon herself to enter our business into a number of local awards and has managed to get us to the finals on three occasions and we were recently awarded the runner up prize. She has also, in her spare time, spearheaded our push into social networking which has boosted our online presence, demonstrating her initiative and willingness to go beyond what her role requires. She continually generates fresh new ideas, one such example being that instead of our regular Christmas card that we design and send to our clients each year, we would instead make a video card (we are a video production company after all!) which went down a treat with our clients, and has become an annual office project. Jenny\u2019s determination is infectious. She is continuously demonstrating her potential and is always looking to learn new skills and take on new roles within the company to help grow our business. All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016."
"9||From Algeria to Thailand: how the world has fallen in love with Leicester CityIt is not only in England that Leicester\u2019s remarkable journey has been followed closely. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s team includes players from around the world and the team have acquired many new supporters in those countries, whether it is in Austria, Denmark or Jamaica. Algeria: President told Mahrez: thank you for making us proud On the 25 April, Riyad Mahrez was named PFA Player of the Year, becoming the first African to win the coveted award. Two days later, the president of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, issued a statement on state television congratulating the winger on his exploits and subsequently thanking him for inspiring Algeria\u2019s children and making the country proud. Algerians have followed Leicester\u2019s historic run closely. Mahrez\u2019s mesmeric play has dominated the front pages of every daily paper. Scores of pedestrians have congregated in front of news stands after weekends for updates as the Foxes inched closer and closer to this most improbable feat. In the heart of Algiers, throbbing crowds buzz around the main souk adjacent to the Place of Martyrs. Between rolls of precious tissue and fruit stands, football kits hang from wire coat hangers. This year, royal navy Leicester kits are outselling staple counterfeit Real Madrid and Barcelona shirts. Nazim, whose shop is at the foot of the old synagogue, imports his Leicester shirts from Thailand and sells them at 3,200 dinars a pop. He says that Mahrez shirts are in demand and he sells up to a dozen per day. Maher Mezahi, Algiers Argentina: Can Ulloa emerge from the shadows of Dybala and Messi? The exploits of Diego Simeone driving Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to the latter stages of the Champions League or the role of Paulo Dybala in Juventus\u2019 fifth consecutive Scudetto are much more interesting to Argentinian media and the football fanatics in this country than Leonardo Ulloa\u2019s story as one of the heroes of Leicester. Maybe that is because he was never considered a star player in the few years he played in the Argentinian first division (31 matches for San Lorenzo, 12 for Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed and 14 for Olimpo de Bah\u00eda Blanca with a total of nine goals in 57 matches). The fact that he has never played for the national team is perhaps also part of the reason he is not being given huge media coverage, or the fact that he was born in a small town, General Roca, 1,000 kilometres from Buenos Aires. He is still an unknown quantity in his homeland. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave Argentina in the best way, pretty much by the back door, to pick up the fight [to succeed] in Spain\u2019s second division\u201d he told La Naci\u00f3n, last month. In the country of Lionel Messi, a lot of Barcelona shirts are being sold on the streets but no Leicester ones, and it is doubtful whether the country\u2019s president Mauricio Macri \u2013 who was chairman of Boca Juniors in the 1990s \u2013 is even aware that an Argentinian striker has played a part in Leicester winning the Premier League. Of course, websites are reporting his goals and Leicester\u2019s wins but no one is suggesting that he should join Lionel Messi and Sergio Ag\u00fcero in La Albiceleste; although the recent, touching letter of Claudio Ranieri to his players caught the media spotlight over here more than Ulloa\u2019s achievements when coming off the bench. Pablo Vignone, La Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires Austria: Pride at title charge that started in town of Bad Radkersburg Austrians are a humble people when it comes to football. Not because we are humble by nature, but because football is not a sport we generally excel in. Here we still talk about of the 3-2 \u2018Miracle-of-Cordoba\u2019 victory over Germany. That was in 1978. Our most talented players do not stay in the domestic league for too long so we learn to appreciate the small things, such as David Alaba doing well for Bayern Munich. But now we have a new person to cheer and follow in Christian Fuchs, the Austria captain and Leicester City full-back. In fact, we can claim some credit for his team\u2019s success this season, as Sportnet.at pointed out: \u201cLeicester City is the big sensation of the football world. The foundation for its success was laid in Austria \u2026 as the season started for them in the South Styrian town of Bad Radkersburg. The team visited the small settlement, population 3,115 from 12-17 June as a part of their pre-season preparations. It was the third time running they had gone there and no wonder that Hotel Park manager Harald Eberhaut is happy for the team. \u201cThis is a sensation,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the beginning I thought, that was a good start, but that it would be over soon. However, they\u2019ve just carried on.\u201d Few would have thought, at the start of the season, that the 30-year old Fuchs from the small town of Neunkirchen near Vienna would win the Premier League title in his first year playing for the club. Naturally, Austrians started supporting Fuchs and his team as they headed for a historic title. It is a miracle almost as big as Austria winning Euro 2016, and we all know that is not going to happen. Austrians may be humble but they are most certainly proud of Christian Fuchs and the \u201cMiracle of Leicester\u201d. David M\u00fcller, Vienna Denmark: Christmas party in Copenhagen made team even more popular It took a mix of a fairytale Premier League title and a Danish goalkeeper as an integral part of it finally to knock Christian Eriksen off the throne as Denmark\u2019s best player. Well, at least in one of the two main awards. For three years Eriksen has been sitting comfortably on the Danish football throne but in 2015 Kasper Schmeichel won one of the two awards ahead of his international team-mate at Spurs. It showed that Schmeichel\u2019s popularity is growing \u2013 and at a fast rate. There are other signs too. Leicester were recently featured on the most popular news show, 21 Sondag, on Danmarks Radio, the country\u2019s public service broadcaster. 21 Sondag normally focuses on investigative journalism and the big political stories but felt that Leicester\u2019s and Schmeichel\u2019s extraordinary adventure was a topic worth covering. Furthermore the newspaper B.T. has had a reporter in Leicester for two weeks now just writing about the city\u2019s club and pretty much every Dane \u2013 apart from Tottenham Hotspur fans \u2013 have been cheering Claudio Ranieri\u2019s team on. The team\u2019s popularity was also helped by their decision to fly to Copenhagen for their Christmas party in December, with some of the players wearing Ninja Turtles costumes. Troels Henriksen, Jyllands-Posten, Copenhagen France: \u2018It is shocking that no one had noticed Kant\u00e9 before\u2019 Ligue 1 does not enjoy the same profile in France as the top clubs in the Premier League have in England, so there was something of an unknown quality to N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 to many casual football supporters in the country when he moved to Leicester from Caen at the beginning of the season. It was not until the Foxes had been well established in first place and the Paris-born midfielder had been called for the national squad that people really started to take notice of him. With greater coverage has followed greater notoriety, although his explosion on the field still seems to be regarded with curiosity as opposed to incredible fanfare. Apart from his former sporting director at Caen, Xavier Gravelaine, who told Ouest France last month: \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of Leicester matches and N\u2019Golo is the same there as he was with Caen. The difference is that he\u2019s playing in the Premier League. It\u2019s shocking that no one\u2019s noticed it before. His explosion doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d On the other hand, Riyad Mahrez\u2019s influence in Leicester\u2019s title success has been widely celebrated by France\u2019s large Algerian community, with his name and number apparently ubiquitous in certain areas. Of course, the coverage of Leicester has been far in excess of what they would have enjoyed previously. Although the report of their win over Swansea last weekend was squirrelled away at page 20 of L\u2019Equipe, they enjoyed more column inches than Juventus winning the Serie A title. Robin Bairner, Paris Germany: Hometown celebrates success of loveable oddity Huth In Germany, Berlin-born defender Robert Huth has long been seen as a loveable oddity: a born Berliner who never played in the domestic league; a player who looked like he belonged to another era even though he took part in modern German football\u2019s sea-change moment; a cult hero, but an imported one. While Huth is fondly remembered by German fans for his role in the \u201csummer fairy tale\u201d of the 2006 World Cup, he was soon discarded in favour of more mobile players like Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng, playing his last game for his country in an insignificant 7-2 friendly against the United Arab Emirates in 2009. A recent in-depth interview in 11 Freunde magazine noted that Huth, who has spent almost half of his life in the UK, appeared to have become \u201cestranged\u201d from his homeland. Leicester\u2019s rise has undoubtedly brought Huth back to the forefront of the national memory, though not quite into the national squad. After Boateng got injured earlier in the year, 80% of users of Sport1 website called for the 31-year-old to be brought back for the Euros. But coach J\u00f6gi L\u00f6w moved swiftly to quash speculation, explaining that he prefers his teams to play further up the pitch than Leicester. Philip Oltermann, Berlin Ghana: Schlupp and Amartey spark curiosity The Premier League\u2019s fans in Ghana are decidedly of the Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and the two Manchester clubs variety; a smattering of Spurs fans and then ... nothing. When a Ghanaian signs for an English club, the team may get support based on the player\u2019s status \u2013 think Asamoah Gyan getting Sunderland a few, while Michael Essien copped Chelsea a large following. If the player is not that huge, say Jordan Ayew, then no can do. It is just pride that Daniel Amartey, Jeffrey Schlupp and 20-year old Joe Dodoo are from these parts, as former Ghana captain Stephen Appiah told Citi FM: \u201cI believe Schlupp is one of the key players for the team. I\u2019m saying that because he got injured, went out for some months and came back with three games to the end of the season and the coach started him. So that shows you how important he is to the team. For Amartey, I am so happy for him because you join a team like Leicester a couple of months ago and you are going to win a trophy.\u201d Still, Leicester shirts are very, very rare in Ghana. Premier League is so big here that people will watch a lot of it and even take a sneak at Everton v WBA. But sure, there is curiosity about Leicester, especially among fans of Arsenal, and Man City because of their title aspirations. Man Utd and Liverpool fans would watch Foxes games just to cheer them on at the expense of the aforementioned two. Gary Al-Smith, Super Sport TV, Accra Italy: Love for gentleman Ranieri comes to the fore Thank you, Leicester. This story has been the stuff of dreams for Italy, the country of Claudio Ranieri. The English city has been the place where we were able to see a new side to Ranieri: he has always been a gentleman, but he has never been so happy and enthusiastic about his job. Ranieri was way too bothered because the world of football in Italy has always been hard to please. Everyone was touched by seeing him so human at Leicester. Here in Italy, Leicester has attracted the same interest as the Italian teams, both in newsrooms and among fans. The team has been always on the front page of the major newspapers, always on every fan\u2019s social media feeds. If you want to know some curious examples, in a high school in Bergamo all of the male students showed up in class with the football shirts of the players of Leicester, from Vardy to Mahrez. They had to buy them at crazy prices on eBay months before, since finding Leicester jerseys here in Italy at the moment is really impossible. As the capital is his birth-place, Roma\u2019s fan club dusted off some old scarves dedicated to Claudio Ranieri, who once coached the side, to support him. Everyone is cheering him in Rome, especially in Testaccio, the district where Ranieri was born and raised. He has left amazing memories in his home town. Walter Veltroni, a former mayor of Rome, interviewed Ranieri as a journalist for Corriere dello Sport and said: \u201cClaudio is fantastic!\u201d There are a lot of bars in which fans gather to cheer on Leicester. A very special fan club for the Foxes was born in Lamezia Terme; meetings were organised on Facebook and took place in city squares from Milan to Florence to cheer their title win. A popular Italian Facebook group (Calciatori Brutti, which means \u201cUgly football players\u201d) decided to organise a road trip from Italy to Leicester by car to celebrate. At the last count, 500 participants were ready to go. All this is for love of the fable called Leicester and for a great coach like Claudio Ranieri. Thank you, Leicester. Fabrizio Romano, Sky Sports, Milan Jamaica: Morgan shirts still not in demand \u2013 but that could yet change Wes Morgan may be born in Nottingham but he has 25 caps for Jamaica after qualifying through his grandparents. The reaction to Leicester\u2019s success in Jamaica is what we assume it has been anywhere in the world: bemused amusement. While the Premier League dominates the local version for attention, any Leicester \u201cwagonists\u201d are waiting carefully for the title; or perhaps the second title when it comes. For now Leicester are everyone\u2019s second team. Speaking to 35-year-old Richard Currie from Kingston, who sells replica football shirts, his business is still to see an increasing demand for a player who has already captained the Reggae Boyz thanks to his defensive leadership for the Foxes. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen an order to date or anyone wearing one,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then Morgan isn\u2019t someone who grew up in Jamaica so perhaps people can\u2019t identify with him like local players; but how he defends and his fighting spirit is what people here identify with him and rate him for. Now he has won the title you\u2019ll see them come out. We Jamaicans are a proud people and we like to show it!\u201d The Guardian did find one newly minted Leicester fan, 20-year-old Hakeem Bryan from Spanish Town, who says he has already ordered his replica shirt: \u201cOf course I\u2019m proud of a fellow Jamaican doing wonderful things in [an] area of sport. It\u2019s special because of the journey and the struggle.\u201d But the name on the back of that shirt? Riyad Mahrez, rather than the uncompromising Jamaican centre-back. In fact, it is rare to see any Raheem Sterling shirts, despite the fact that he was born in Kingston. But that is partly down to there not being many Manchester City supporters around, though that could change with Pep Guardiola arriving. Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal are still the big teams here with Chelsea making some inroads in recent years. Leicester still have a long way to go. Ross Sheil, Kingston Japan: The Foxes brought into the wider public conscience Takarazuka, a short drive from Kobe in western Japan, is famous nationwide for its all-female theatre. Now, one of the city\u2019s celebrated sons has played a vital supporting role in perhaps the most astounding tale ever played out on the English football stage. The arrival of Shinji Okazaki this season promoted Leicester City to top billing when J Sports selected which five of the 10 Premier League matches it would broadcast each matchday. At first, this was merely provisional; interest would surely soon wane as it had for Maya Yoshida at Southampton and fans of the five biggest clubs could be guaranteed their customary live coverage again. But ultimately, Japanese viewers have stayed with the Foxes\u2019 story right from opening day through to its glorious conclusion. Leicester\u2019s romantic win prompted a host of articles across the specialist sporting press. In a country that has only had professional football for 23 years, and where it is not particularly uncommon for newly promoted sides to challenge for J. League honours, Japan\u2019s finest football writers have grappled for the right words to explain just how improbable this achievement has been. The mainstream media tends to focus on the more obvious star quality of Keisuke Honda and AC Milan, but camera-friendly scenes like the win at Manchester City and Okazaki\u2019s overhead kick against Newcastle United have gradually brought the Foxes into the wider public conscience. Expect plenty more Leicester features on terrestrial television now the trophy has been claimed. Ben Mabley, J-Sports, Osaka Thailand: Vardy can be seen all over Bangkok airport Leicester City football players are known in Thailand as the \u201cSiamese Foxes\u201d and the club\u2019s Thai owner has flown Buddhist monks out to England to bless the stadium, where the Thai king\u2019s portrait has also been raised. While Foxes fervour has not completely immersed the south-east Asian country in blue, you can\u2019t make it through Bangkok airport without seeing striker Jamie Vardy\u2019s face. The club\u2019s owner runs the duty-free company King Power, which has placed video adverts in terminals showing Vardy running around an airport shop in full kit while picking up tax-free gifts. It also sells collectable gift cards with photos of Kasper Schmeichel and Riyad Mahrez. The club\u2019s Thai-language YouTube channel has videos showing the Foxes emblem with \u201cPride of Thais\u201d underneath. Despite Leicester\u2019s unstoppable rise, many in Thailand have stuck to the foreign favourites Manchester United and Liverpool. But there are converts and Leicester\u2019s colour is an increasingly common sight around the capital. Official shirts have sold out but there are a few rip-offs at the street stalls.

Not only does he perform any task, no matter how challenging, without a single complaint, he says yes to doing the task and then works out exactly how to complete it afterwards. He has what I call the \u2018yes gene\u2019. It means that whatever I need doing that I can\u2019t work out myself, I will give to Matthew knowing that he will figure it out. He works any hours that are required of him, whether that be getting up at 4am to fly to France for a meeting or working weekends to get artwork completed for a product launch. And all the time he never complains or grumbles. As we are only a small company, he has to wear a lot of hats. He handles the marketing designs, stock management (he built our entire stock system on Excel), trade and consumer shows, sales and anything else I need doing on that particular day. In the past year he secured and pitched a meeting with Target in America, has been instrumental in the new packaging designing of our bar relaunch and almost single handedly formulated and designed our revolutionary new products launching in April. With his management of the account, we grew sales by 1721% in Ocado alone in 2015. Without Matthew, Creative Nature wouldn\u2019t be where we are today.

"9||Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 charged with violent conduct  for \u2018eye-gouging\u2019 Diego CostaMousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is facing a lengthy ban after the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder was charged with violent conduct for an alleged eye gouge on Diego Costa, with both Spurs and Chelsea also hit with Football Association charges following Monday\u2019s tempestuous Premier League match. The FA said the nature of Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s action was such that the usual three-match violent-conduct suspension \u201cis clearly insufficient\u201d, meaning the midfielder may miss a stretch of games at the beginning of next season. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 could be suspended for five to six matches if found guilty of pushing a finger towards Costa\u2019s eye at the end of the first half, although the Belgian has until 6pm on Thursday to appeal against the decision. The incident was not seen by the referee, Mark Clattenburg, or his assistants, during a melee at the end of the first half, but the FA has analysed TV footage to bring the charge. Off-the-ball incidents which are not seen by match officials are referred to a panel of three former referees to review. The FA also contends that the two London clubs failed to control their players on three occasions during the 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. Both may receive six-figure fines following a series of ugly incidents. Nine Tottenham players were booked by Clattenburg on the night, a record for a single team in a Premier League match \u2013 with Spurs riled up against their London rivals when their title hopes were on the line. There were numerous confrontations throughout the game but two brawls \u2013 at the end of the first half and after the final whistle \u2013 stood out. The FA says Chelsea and Tottenham failed to control their players \u201cin the 45th and 87th minutes and also at the end of the game\u201d. The clubs have until 6pm on Monday to respond to the charge and are expected to receive significant fines. There will be no action taken against \u00c9rik Lamela, who appeared to step on Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s hand while the Spaniard was on the ground, as the officials did see that particular incident. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is the only individual charged by the governing body despite several players being heavily involved in the controversy, notably Michel Vorm, F\u00e0bregas and Danny Rose. Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs manager, encroached on the pitch to separate Rose and Willian at the end of the first half, a fracas that sparked the melee resulting in Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 raising his hand to Costa\u2019s face, but there was further controversy at full-time. The Tottenham reserve goalkeeper Vorm and F\u00e0bregas were in the thick of a brawl involving players, coaches and backroom staff by the tunnel. Guus Hiddink, the Chelsea coach, had to usher F\u00e0bregas down the tunnel before being knocked to the ground. Hiddink said many insults were being uttered in Spanish. Eden Hazard\u2019s late goal handed Leicester City the Premier League title despite Spurs taking a 2-0 lead in the match through Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. Hazard and F\u00e0bregas had spoken beforehand of their desire to end Tottenham\u2019s title hopes and there was a full\u2011blooded tempo to the match."

"15||Google's DeepMind shouldn't suck up our NHS records in secretWhen it was revealed that Google\u2019s London-based company DeepMind would be able to access the NHS records of 1.6 million patients who use three London hospitals run by the Royal Free NHS trust \u2013 Barnet, Chase Farm and the Royal Free \u2013 it rang alarm bells. Not just because the British fiercely guard their intimate medical histories. Not just because Google, a sprawling octopus of a company with tentacles in all our lives, wishes to \u201corganise the world\u2019s information\u201d. Not just because patients are unlikely to have consented to Google having this information. The issue for many is the intertwining of these concerns with the idea of artificial intelligence (AI). DeepMind is no ordinary company. It specialises in AI, developing technology to exhibit something like intelligent reasoning. Last year its engineers produced a research paper showing it had created a program that could replicate the work of a \u201cprofessional human video games tester\u201d. In March, Google\u2019s DeepMind made history by creating a program that mastered the 3,000-year-old Chinese board game Go, thought to be beyond current technology because of the number of possible moves. In what was considered a computing milestone, the company\u2019s AlphaGo program beat the world Go champion 4-1. Now such a company has a database containing detailed, private, albeit anonymised, records of all these people\u2019s medical history, including HIV status, past drug overdoses and abortions. DeepMind says it needs the data to produce medical alerts for hospitals attempting to prevent acute kidney injuries. The fear for some is that DeepMind\u2019s database could allow for much more than the original stated purpose. The public is no stranger to the fact that NHS patient privacy has not been safeguarded \u2013 in 2014 the government was forced to halt and then scale back its proposals to produce a single English medical database over concerns that medical confidentiality could be put at risk. DeepMind has not hidden its work with the NHS, announcing in February it was working with the health service to build an app called Streams to help doctors and nurses monitor kidney patients. What it did not reveal was the extent of its data haul, which encompasses historical patient records. Instead of the few thousand patients with kidney injuries, DeepMind got all the patient records of all three hospitals. That\u2019s millions of confidential documents. It says it needs the entire patient database to make Streams work. Backers of such databases claim that with such data powerful software packages can be created to diagnose diseases sooner. The New Scientist magazine obtained the data-sharing agreement between DeepMind and the NHS, which revealed just how much information was being made available. The Google company\u2019s skill is to discern complex patterns in huge quantities of data \u2013 and the NHS is a goldmine for such \u201cdeep learning\u201d. In this treasure trove of data are logs of day-to-day hospital activity, such as records of the location and status of patients \u2013 as well as who visits them and when. DeepMind will also obtain pathology and radiology test patient records. As well as real-time data, DeepMind has access to the historical records from critical care and accident and emergency departments. Crunching this information, so the theory goes, allows DeepMind to develop predictions based on data that is too broad in scope for any one person to assimilate and analyse. By comparing patient data, DeepMind might be able to predict that someone is in the early stages of a disease that has not yet become apparent. This is the medical holy grail: not treating a patient when they are ill, but treating them before they become ill. Utopian? Perhaps. Behind the promise of these technologies lies the crux of the dilemma in the age we live. Google, Facebook and others feed on the fact we suspend our privacy rights in return for new technology built with our data. Like Apple, Google is building a reputation in medical apps. It is also true that the use of machine learning in medicine by academics is nothing new. However this data is being passed to and controlled by one of the world\u2019s biggest and most powerful companies. It raises questions over whether it might quickly become the biggest player, a de facto monopoly, over NHS health analytics. AI also represents something new, a promise that a program could improve itself \u2013 and very quickly surpass human intellect. This is the so-called \u201cintelligence explosion\u201d \u2013 a point where humanity courts its own destruction. We are some way off this. No one has built a machine that respects social and ethical norms, even at the expense of its goals. It\u2019s difficult enough to get humans to do that. Some may say such extrapolation is ridiculous. After all Tay \u2013 the \u201cintelligent\u201d Twitter chatbot from Microsoft \u2013 lasted a few hours until she \u201clearned\u201d to become a racist, genocidal tweeter and was killed off. However as Elon Musk, the inventor who originally invested in DeepMind, said, it was worries over \u201cTerminator\u201d technology that drove him to warn about its dangers. For perhaps sound commercial reasons, DeepMind operates under the radar. But this often raises more questions than answers. Google\u2019s AI ethics board, established when Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 for \u00a3400m, remains one of the biggest mysteries in technology, with both companies refusing to reveal who sits on it. Artificial intelligence needs data to learn. Hence the sucking up of all those patient records by Google\u2019s DeepMind. So why the secrecy? If patients had been told what was going on and why, they could make informed choices. If they think the potential risks of Google dominance over a new critical technology for the NHS are outweighed by the benefits, then let\u2019s have that debate. But if the company does not explain and carries on in secret, the public will rightly not go along with such plans."
"32||Cutting edge: could crop tops for men return?There\u2019s a scene in Richard Linklater\u2019s new comedy, the 1980 set Everybody Wants Some!! that stands out. Hot headed McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin) is hitting baseballs with an axe in order to chop them in two. It\u2019s one of the most alpha scenes in an alpha movie, but what\u2019s interesting is that McReynolds is chopping dressed in a black, netted crop top. In 2016, the male crop top is creeping back into view \u2013 a sartorial metaphor for the industry\u2019s increasing blurring of gender lines. In womenswear, the cropped top is very on trend from Balmain to Ivy Park, as a form of athleisure. But in the more cautious world of menswear, only a smattering of boundary-pushing designers such as J.W.Anderson, Astrid Anderson and Nasir Mazhar have featured the piece, riffing on the intersection between male and female clothes. It is perfectly summed up by Andersen\u2019s description of her aesthetic as: \u201ca masculine attraction with feminine references\u201d. It\u2019s something that came to mind when NFL player Ezekiel Elliot wore a bow-tied suit with a crop-topped shirt at the NFL draft red carpet (a sort of Who\u2019s Who of the next American football season). There were prosaic and humorous reasons for his choice of clothes: \u201cI\u2019m known as the hero in the half shirt, so I had to go out on the red carpet in a crop top,\u201d he said. But the vision of Elliot in a crop top was significant in the way it skewered perceptions of how American football players should dress, with a Beckham-ish ripple. The subsequent reaction, in some quarters, was predictably severe. Perhaps that\u2019s because a bare belly on display creates a visual message that is jarring for some, both hyper-masculine (look at my six pack!) but feminised when wrapped up in a crop-top bow. It\u2019s very different to the 80s, when the male crop top was regularly on the pop culture landscape: Bill (Alex Winter) from Bill + Ted and Johnny Depp in Nightmare on Elm Street. As seen in Everybody Wants Some!!!, it was a look that was sports casual, referencing the aerobics craze and a general taste for the outdoors. The meaning of the crop top was altered when Prince wore it during his Under the Cherry Moon era (1986). Fresh from experimenting with lace and ruffles, he went for a sleek, European aesthetic (shorter hair, big suits). It was all significantly more masculine save for the crop tops he wore on the album cover and in the videos for Mountains and Kiss. With the bodycon fit, the curved, four-buttoned black top he wore during this time, he was riffing on its sport associations but also its place between genders. Could the crop top resurface in the collections in June \u2013 a harbinger of what\u2019s to come in menswear? I\u2019d bet my half shirt on it \u2026"
"20||Martha Argerich: Live from Lugano CD review \u2013 real sense of occasion for 'friends' compilationThe releases of recordings from the Progetto Martha Argerich, the festival over which the great lady presides each June in the Swiss resort of Lugano, have become one of the most reliable annual fixtures in the CD calendar. The latest compilation is more or less the mixture as before, bringing together musicians from several generations with whom Argerich has worked regularly or whose careers she has closely monitored, and featuring a range of mainstream chamber works as well as historical rarities and arrangements for multiple pianos. Argerich fans are always looking for additions to her personal discography, too, and they get a couple here. She joins Lilya Zilberstein in Debussy\u2019s two-piano arrangement of Schumann\u2019s Six Canonic Studies Op 56, originally written for pedal piano; and with Eduardo Hubert as the other soloist and the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana under Alexander Vedernikov, she takes on Porte\u00f1a (Latitude 34\u00b0 36\u00b0 30\u00b0), for two pianos and orchestra, a rather gruesome, sub-Piazzolla portrait of Buenos Aires by film-score composer Luis Bacalov. Otherwise, she partners Alexander Mogilevsky in Schubert\u2019s Variations in A flat, D813, the violinist G\u00e9za Hosszu-Legocky in an arrangement of Bartok\u2019s Romanian Dances, and joins Stephen Kovacevich for a rather stormy, fierce account of Debussy\u2019s En Blanc et Noir, a work they recorded together in the 1970s. Otherwise, the repertoire ranges from a piano quintet by Ferdinand Ries to suites for three pianos from Philip Glass\u2019s dance opera Les Enfants Terribles, and Alberto Ginastera\u2019s ballet Estancia, via Turina, Poulenc and quite a lot of Brahms. Best of all, perhaps, are a fabulously supple account of Brahms\u2019s late Clarinet Trio, with Paul Meyer, Gautier Capu\u00e7on and Nicholas Angelich, and the same composer\u2019s Horn Trio, Op 40, in an arrangement that replaces the horn with a viola. It sounds a very different beast without the power and eloquence of the brass instrument, but it\u2019s done with great care and awareness by Nathan Braude, Ilya Gringolts and Mogilevsky, and there is still the sense of occasion and uniqueness that you seem to get with everything that comes out of these Lugano gatherings."
"3||BBC's demise is 'tempting prospect', jokes John WhittingdaleJohn Whittingdale has said the BBC\u2019s approach to impartiality drives him \u201cinsane\u201d and joked about abolishing the corporation in a talk at Cambridge University\u2019s Conservative Association. In a marked departure from careful public statements made ahead of the publication of a white paper on the next BBC charter, the culture secretary also indicated his commitment to hand part of the licence fee to outside organisations to make programming such as children\u2019s TV, arts coverage and local news. \u201cThere is a case for having some plurality, so that the decision as to what programmes are commissioned isn\u2019t exclusively taken by the small group of commissioning editors at the BBC,\u201d he said. Director general Tony Hall last week sought reassurances from the chancellor, George Osborne, that so-called \u201ctop-slicing\u201d would not take place, having considered the prospect ruled out under the funding agreement struck with the Treasury last year. The comments, which were first reported by Cambridge University\u2019s student newspaper Varsity and verified by Broadcast, were made at an event last Friday, in which he described the BBC as \u201ca market intervention of around \u00a34bn by government\u201d. They reveal Whittingdale\u2019s dissatisfaction with the way the BBC handles complaints over impartiality. He told the association that \u201csometimes they will drive me insane\u201d and confirmed he would strip responsibility for handling complaints from the BBC Trust. The pro-Brexit minister added that the corporation \u201cfinds it difficult to take seriously people who have a different view of the world\u201d and \u201chas always regarded people who want to leave Europe as faintly mad [and] it has generally been in favour of spending public money rather than those who want to see lower taxes\u201d. He also jokingly said of the BBC\u2019s charter, which runs out at the end of 2017, \u201cif we don\u2019t renew it, it may be that the BBC will cease to exist, which is occasionally a tempting prospect\u201d."

The World Trophy, which has \u00a3150,000 in prize money on offer, runs for three days from 28-30 May. \u201cThough I have worked predominantly in boxing for nearly 40 years, I have also promoted and been involved in various other sports and entertainment ventures throughout my career,\u201d said Warren. \u201cI am delighted to have been part of setting this event up and securing the BDO one of the UK\u2019s leading broadcasters for the event.\u201d The BDO World Trophy event was set up in 2014 and the first two tournaments were broadcast by pay-TV channel Eurosport, which is owned by Discovery. The World Trophy event is separate from the BDO World Darts Championship, which has been broadcast exclusively on BT Sport since the BBC decided to axe coverage of the event after 28 years. UKTV-owned Dave, which uses the strapline \u201cthe home of witty banter\u201d, airs shows including reruns of 8 Out of 10 Cats, Top Gear, Mock the Week and QI, while it also features US programmes such as Storage Hunters and Lizard Lick Towing. In the past it has aired non-exclusive coverage of World Cup football and Six Nations rugby. Dave also has the exclusive rights to Red Bull\u2019s extreme sports programming such as Red Bull Soap Box Race, Cliff Diving and X-Fighters. \u201cWe are constantly looking for new opportunities and show ideas for Dave to keep our audiences entertained,\u201d said Steve North, general manager of Dave at UKTV. \u201cAfter the incredible experience we had with the David Haye fight at the start of the year we are delighted to be delving further into the sporting world by partnering with the BDO in what is a fantastic opportunity to offer fans extended live coverage of the BDO World Trophy.\u201d"
"22||Guinevere Boyd obituaryMy mother, Guinevere Boyd, who has died aged 87, was a dedicated teacher, and then headteacher, at a school for disabled children in Hounslow, west London. She began working at Martindale special school in 1958 when her daughter, Sally, went there for some treatment. When Sally died the following year, aged two, Guin was offered a part-time position. She eventually became a full-time teacher and stayed at the school for more than 30 years, the last 10 as head. In her time at Martindale she helped hundreds of children and their families to cope with a range of physical and emotional challenges, even inviting pupils to stay at her home to give their parents respite. Martindale was a happy place with much laughter and singing. Guin always said: \u201cSome say that disabled people shouldn\u2019t be separated from society and that is true. But at Martindale every child is normal.\u201d Guin was the daughter of Leslie Fordham, a semi-skilled worker in factories and a delivery driver, and his wife, Ivy. She was born and brought up in Feltham, Middlesex, and trained to be a teacher at Furzedown College, Twickenham (now St Mary\u2019s University). She married immediately after qualifying as a teacher, aged 21, when she met John Boyd, a communist steel worker from Newcastle in 1949, who had moved into a house opposite Guin\u2019s parents. John, a former boxer, had just ridden his motor bike across Europe to try to start a new life in the USSR. They had two sons, Tim and Nick, before Sally was born. It was Guin who first noticed that all was not well with their daughter and was frustrated that her concerns were not shared by doctors. After Sally\u2019s death, it was discovered that she had been suffering from a rare neurological condition. Guin and John later had one more child, Simon. After retiring from Martindale in 1990, Guin carried on helping people. She joined the Citizens Advice Bureau, and at nights answered phones and counselled people as a Samaritan. When John died in 2000, Guin moved to Newhaven, East Sussex, and became a prison visitor. In her 80s she became a witness support officer, helping people about to make an appearance in court. She is survived by her sons and two grandsons, Jack and Harry."
"12||Zindabad review \u2013 compelling European view of India's partitionHoward Brenton\u2019s Drawing the Line dramatised the partition of India, concluding it was \u201ca farce drenched in blood\u201d. David Conville\u2019s play focuses on the impact of partition on the Europeans in the Punjab, who in 1947 were on the Pakistani side of the border. While formally traditional, the play compellingly shows how private passion can coincide with public chaos. In part, the play is about what happened when Harry met Sally: he is an archaeologist of mixed French and Hindu heritage, she is the wife of a neighbouring English farmer, and revelation of their affair erupts at the very moment of partition. But love is no less real for occurring at the wrong time, and Conville skilfully shows the couple\u2019s awareness of their need to protect everyone caught up in the Muslim-Hindu violence: much of the tension comes from seeing Harry ensure a safe passage to India for the legendary archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler, as well as the wife of a local commissioner and beleaguered Hindu staff. This may be history seen from a European perspective but, given that Conville was born in India and his family farmed the land there, the play has the ring of truth. Richard Digby Day, as director, has assembled a first-rate cast that includes Frank Barrie as the worldly Wheeler, Justin Butcher and Rebecca Johnson as the tormented lovers, Ranjit Krishnamma as a Muslim hardliner and Linda Thorson as the wife of a Hindu politician. The play deserves more than a brief week-long run. At Yvonne Arnaud theatre, Guildford, until 7 May. Box office: 01483 440000"
"0||Indiana smashes Republican delegate math but changes little for DemocratsOn Tuesday, voters in Indiana selected Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders to lead them in November\u2019s general election. Indiana was the last major state to vote before California chooses its presidential nominees on 7 June, so its primary was predicted to be pivotal. And boy, was it. Trump is now almost certain to be the Republican presidential nominee \u2013 not least because his nearest rival, Ted Cruz, suspended his campaign after the results were announced. And despite Sanders\u2019 win, Hillary Clinton is still on course to be the Democratic nominee. With 98% of the results in for Indiana, here\u2019s a look at how the delegate math is now in favour of Trump and Clinton. Winning 53% of the Hoosier State\u2019s Republican vote, Trump scooped up all 51 available delegates and crossed the 1,000-delegate mark. The New York businessman only needs 190 more delegates to secure the nomination. There are just nine Republican primaries remaining before the party convention in July, with a total of 445 delegates available. Now that Cruz has stepped out of the race, Trump will collect almost all of those delegates. The Cruz campaign had no doubt looked at the math: to have stopped Trump from reaching the finish line, the Texas senator would have had to grab all 172 delegates in California. That feat looked unlikely, given that he was polling 26 percentage points behind Trump in the Golden State. Simply put, Trump\u2019s opponents were less popular than he is. Cruz\u2019s announcement last week that Carly Fiorina would be his running mate appears to have had little effect. In a survey of 3,940 registered voters by Morning Consult, only 18% of Republicans said they more likely to vote for Cruz now he was running with Fiorina, 22% said it made them less likely to vote for Cruz, and 60% said it had \u201cno impact\u201d. Trump\u2019s only remaining opponent, John Kasich, has the support of just one in five Republicans. Trump\u2019s success in Indiana can be attributed to a few factors. The state\u2019s population is 86% white and it has a median household income of $49,000, almost $5,000 less than the national median. Both race and income have been shown to correlate with support for the New York businessman. Now that the Republican nomination is all but a done deal, Trump will begin to use those demographics to calculate his chances of winning in November. Despite Sanders\u2019 surprise victory in Indiana, the Democratic race is fundamentally unchanged \u2013 Clinton looks near certain to be the nominee. Sanders finished the night with 52.5% of the vote and 43 delegates. However, Democratic primaries are not winner-takes-all and so Clinton\u2019s vote share in Indiana translated into 37 delegates. In terms of net differences, the only ones that matter in primary races, Sanders only won six extra delegates \u2013 and that simply isn\u2019t enough given that Clinton is ahead by 321 pledged delegates and by 481 superdelegates. For the Vermont senator, there is worse to come. To win the nomination, Sanders needs to capture around two-thirds of the remaining pledged delegates. But polling shows him trailing in Montana, New Jersey and, crucially, California. California will be decisive in the Democratic race, since it offers 546 delegates. Sanders will need to win the majority to have a chance of securing the nomination, but he has an approximately nine-point gap to close on Clinton. Despite this, it seems unlikely that Sanders will drop out of the Democratic race until he has no choice. And there seems to be party consensus that this is a good thing \u2013 a poll released this week by NBC News and Survey Monkey found that 57% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want Sanders to stay in the race until the convention. Given the size of Trump\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s leads, it\u2019s likely both candidates will begin to turn their attention away from the remaining primary elections and towards the upcoming national election. Current polling suggests that Clinton has an average lead of six percentage points over Trump."

"33||How Jane Jacobs changed the way we look at citiesI first met Jane Jacobs in the early 90s. She was sitting in the front row of a large Toronto auditorium as I delivered a one-hour lecture. I did not know who she was. When I was done, the first hand up \u2013 sharply so \u2013 belonged to this elderly person. How wonderful, I thought, a citizen who has never stopped being engaged. What came out of her mouth, though, was one of the sharpest critiques of my way of analysing the city that I\u2019d ever heard \u2013 and probably ever will. She pursued a line of questioning quite different from what I usually get. She continously returned to the issue of \u201cplace\u201d, and its importance when considering the implementation of urban policies \u2013 notably the loss of neighbourhoods and erasure of local residents\u2019 experiences. Her input made me shift my thinking to more \u201cmicro\u201d levels; I am still doing quite a bit of work today on the need to relocalise pieces of national and city economies. So perhaps now, on the 100th anniversary of her birth, we should all be asking: what is it that Jane Jacobs made us want to see in the city? Thinking about this question leads me to focus on the conditions that make a metropolis \u2013 the enormous diversity of workers, their living and work spaces, the multiple sub-economies involved. Many of these are now seen as irrelevant to the global city, or belonging to another era. But a close look, as encouraged by Jacobs, shows us this is wrong. She would ask us to look at the consequences of these sub-economies for the city \u2013 for its people, its neighbourhoods, and the visual orders involved. She would ask us to consider all the other economies and spaces impacted by the massive gentrifications of the modern city \u2013 not least, the resultant displacements of modest households and profit-making, neighbourhood firms. How do we see those aspects that are typically rendered invisible by modern narratives of development and urban competitiveness? In the early 1900s, the city was a lens for understanding larger processes \u2013 but half a century later, it had lost that role. It was Jane Jacobs who taught us again to view the city in a deeper, more complex way. She helped us re-emphasise dimensions that were usually excluded \u2013 no, expelled \u2013 from general analyses of the urban economy. Indeed, I can imagine she would have affirmed without a quiver of doubt that, no matter how electronic and global the city might one day become, it still has to be \u201cmade\u201d \u2013 and therein lies the importance of place. The city has long been a strategic site for the exploration of major subjects confronting society. In the first half of the 20th century, the study of cities was at the heart of sociology \u2013 evident in the work of Simmel, Weber, Benjamin, Lefebvre and the Chicago School. These sociologists confronted massive processes: industrialisation, urbanisation, alienation, and a new cultural formation they called \u201curbanity\u201d. Studying the city meant studying the major social processes of an era. But by the 1950s, the study of the city had gradually lost this privileged role as producer of key analytic categories. The social sciences, we might say, lost their capacity to \u201csee\u201d the city and all that it made visible. But not Jacobs. For her, the barricades \u2013 both figurative and literal \u2013 played a role not merely as part of the battle to preserve one of the oldest parts of Manhattan, but in her entire analysis of the urban economy. Jacobs\u2019 passionate fight to protect \u201cthe Village\u201d in Lower Manhattan was about much more than preserving an old urban landscape (though this in itself was enough to warrant a fight in a city like New York \u2013 where the developers ruled, and basically did not care about legacy or visual orders). Talking with Jacobs, it became clear that community battles were, for her, simply part of a wider inquiry as she sought to better understand, and develop concepts for, the role of cities in the economy. Richard Sennett, who was often on the \u201cpicket lines\u201d with Jacobs, talks of her calm ferocity; she was relentless, and stood up to anyone \u2013 no matter her smallish frame and, eventually, her elderly condition. Why is it so important to recover the sense of place, and production, in our analyses of the global economy, particularly as these are constituted in major cities? Because they allow us to see the multiplicity of economies and working cultures in which regional, national and global economies are embedded. But Jacobs went much further than this. What she showed us, crucially, is that urban space is the key building block of these economies. She understood it is the weaving of multiple strands that makes the city so much more than the sum of its residents, or its grand buildings, or its corporate economy.

"11||Windows 10 updates are now ruining pro-gaming streamsPerhaps there\u2019s nothing more annoying than going in for the kill to suddenly be \u201cpooped on\u201d by a Windows 10 automatic installation taking out your computer mid-stream to your 130,000 or so followers. After deciding to try and ruin advertise during the weather by attempting to automatically install midway through a forecast, Windows 10 is starting to wreak havoc with gamers. Ex-professional Counter Strike player turned full-time streamer Erik Flom was rudely interrupted mid-game and live on Twitch by Windows 10 automatically installing on his PC. \u201cWhat. What!? How did this happen! Fuck you Windows 10!\u201d Flom screamed at the PC. \u201cOh my God! You had one job PC. We turned off everything. Update faster you fuck!\u201d Initial outrage flowed into jubilation as it appeared Windows 10 was nearing completion, only for Flom to have his hopes dashed by a second installation countdown. The whole lot was captured live on game video-streaming service Twitch through a video capture system, which remained operational while the gaming PC installed Windows 10. This is perhaps the first recorded instance of Windows 10 installing automatically while a user is actively using their PC, rather than having just nipped off to make a cup of tea. Regardless of how good Windows 10 might be and how automatic installs boost user numbers, forcing it down the throats of unsuspecting gamers, weather people and workers isn\u2019t exactly going to breed goodwill among Windows users."
"34||Poverty driving Syrian men and boys into the arms of IsisPoverty, desperation and the desire for revenge are the key factors pushing young Syrians to join Isis and other extremist groups \u2013 and are more significant than ideological or religious motivation, according to research by a peace-building group. Adolescent boys and young men between the ages of 12 and 24 were found to be most at risk, along with children and young adults not in education, internally displaced people and refugees without supportive family structures. Interviews with more than 300 young Syrians \u2013 in Syria, Lebanon and Turkey \u2013 point to factors of both vulnerability and resilience to recruitment by Isis and Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian affiliate), which are both proscribed as terrorist organisations by the UN. \u201cRadicalisation is not an explanation for joining a violent extremist group per se,\u201d said the study by International Alert (pdf). \u201cFor many young Syrians, belief in extreme ideologies appears to be, at most, a secondary factor in the initial decision to join an extremist group. Religion is providing a moral medium for coping and justification for fighting, rather than a basis for rigid and extreme ideologies.\u201d Vulnerability is driven by a combination of extreme trauma, loss and displacement, lack of alternative ways to make a decent living, the collapse of social structures and institutions, including education, and the desire to take revenge against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, the report says. Its findings about the causes of extremism are broadly in line with a recent wider survey of Arab youth, which situated the causes of radicalisation in a lack of jobs and opportunities. In eight of the 16 countries surveyed, employment problems were a bigger pull factor for Isis than extreme religious views. Young Syrian men also said that joining armed groups provides a strong sense of purpose, honour and self-worth \u2013 \u201ca new life where they are wanted\u201d. Economic imperatives explained why individuals have switched membership and allegiance based on salaries, resources and the regularity of payment. Fighting for an extremist group is normally far more lucrative than fighting for a moderate one. Nusra fighters are paid $300\u2013400 (\u00a3205-275) per month. Fighters in the Free Syrian Army are paid only \u2013 and often late \u2013 about $100 per month. In the words of one interviewee: \u201cAn 18-year-old guy I met was fighting with the Free Syrian Army \u2026 After two days of fighting, his unit ran out of ammunition. For two further days, he remained there, waiting to be hit by Syrian regime forces. He then managed to escape his unit, went over to Jabhat al-Nusra\u2019s territory and [the group] offered him ammunition and a salary to fight for [it]. He didn\u2019t believe in [its] ideology but [it] had the bullets.\u201d Nusra had been more successful than Isis in establishing itself as a \u201cquasi-legitimate, community-based organisation providing relative security, protection, education and structure on a daily basis\u201d, the survey found. But trauma played an important role in extremist recruitment \u2013 one young man joined Isis after being raped and tortured in a regime prison. A friend described him as now being \u201ccompletely brainwashed\u201d. The report shows that the collapse of Syria\u2019s education system, with about 2 million children now out of school, has also greatly contributed to young people\u2019s vulnerability to joining violent extremist groups, which are filling the gap by providing segregated and sectarian teaching. Comprehensive, inclusive and quality education, including trauma healing and psychosocial support \u2013 such as that being implemented through International Alert\u2019s peace education project in Syria and the region \u2013 was one of the four key factors that could prevent recruitment. \u201cIn Syria, children who aren\u2019t engaged in [psychosocial support] like this are so vulnerable \u2026 they could be directly recruited by Daesh [Isis] or al-Nusra,\u201d said one peace educator in Lebanon. \u201cWe give them tools to express themselves in the community, rather than using weapons to express anger at their losses.\u201d Other preventive factors included providing alternative and respected sources of livelihood, access to supportive social networks and alternative avenues for non-violent activism. The conflict in Syria erupted at the height of the Arab spring in March 2011. It has claimed up to 400,000 lives and displaced 6.6 million people internally and prompted 4.8 million more to flee the country."
"35||Without parent governors, schools face an uphill battle to engage familiesWhen the government released the latest education white paper in March, the plan to force all schools to become academies drew the most headlines. The Department for Education probably expected less pushback to the announcement that schools will no longer need to keep two spaces for elected parent governors. The one-sentence proposal, on page 51 of the document, states: \u201cWe will expect all governing boards to focus on seeking people with the right skills for governance, and so we will no longer require academy trusts to reserve places for elected parents on governing boards.\u201d But there was pushback \u2013 a lot of it. Education secretary Nicky Morgan published a blog on Mumsnet the day after the report\u2019s publication, and it quickly received 1,000 comments \u2013 the maximum a post can get. The vast majority were less than impressed. One user wrote: \u201cEmpowering parents by removing parent governors. By denying parents choice. Classic double think.\u201d Another asked: \u201cIf you want parents to have a stronger voice, why are you doing away with parent governors? Why change from a system with democratically elected stakeholders, to a system with remote, skills-based governors instead, who represent business rather than the parents and the local community?\u201d Morgan did not respond, although David Cameron has since sought to defend the government\u2019s position, highlighting the \u201cfreedom\u201d offered by the change. So why are people so concerned? \u201cOur worry is that these boards will only bring in people they know and become very inward-looking,\u201d says Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governors\u2019 Association (NGA). \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a theoretical argument \u2013 we\u2019re seeing it start to happen in some academies already. When you look at the list of job titles, you think: \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a high-powered board.\u2019 But they don\u2019t always govern well because they don\u2019t always understand the implications of decisions.\u201d What parent governors bring, she says, is a different perspective. They provide a unique angle on the issues affecting the school community, calling on knowledge and experience that other governors simply do not have. Sarah Bamford, vice-chair of the board of governors at Redlands primary school in Reading, says parents\u2019 personal investment in the success of a school is key. \u201cWho cares more than a parent? This is why it seems bonkers not to have to have them on the governing board.\u201d Just as crucial, she continues, is the fact that parent governors have a presence in the community, which can help concerns to come to light. \u201cIf you are a parent, in primary schools especially, you are quite visible,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be seen as part of a secret cabal \u2013 nobody wants to be governed by people they never see.\u201d Knights agrees. \u201cThe government has neglected to think about the fact that schools are public services, they\u2019re not corporate,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve misunderstood the idea of collective attachment and collective ownership of a service. I think they saw it as a small, technical adjustment \u2013 I don\u2019t think they realised how this would be perceived.\u201d This is not to say that there aren\u2019t issues with parent governors, of course. The NGA released a report last month to address arguments they hear against parent governors, including that some can be disruptive and divert focus from the issues at hand. Others argue that parents are bound to steer discussion towards issues that affect their own children. But this is where good training is essential. Policing what issues are raised with the board is the job of the chair, Knights argues. Moreover, if parents have been properly briefed about their remit, Knights says, they should know that their role is to govern in the interests of the entire school, not just their own interests. Bamford has also encountered this misunderstanding: \u201cThe election process for parent governors can give the impression that you are putting someone forward to represent the people and that\u2019s not what the role is at all. I do see how they [parents] could be disruptive in that situation, but with good training, there\u2019s no reason that should be the case.\u201d Appropriate training would also address the government\u2019s concerns about the current level of skill on governing boards. \u201cYou have to induct governors \u2013 it\u2019s a really complex, difficult role,\u201d Knights says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just invite people in and give them a bunch of papers and expect them to know what their responsibility is.\u201d The white paper proposes to empower parents in a different way. In her Mumsnet blog, Morgan writes: \u201cI am well aware that the education system can appear complex to many parents. I am dedicated to changing this once and for all, and putting the control firmly back in your hands. \u201cI plan to introduce a new, online parents portal from as early as next year. This portal will enable parents\u2019 access to key information and allow you to support your child\u2019s learning.\u201d This was met with a less than rapturous response. One commenter asked: \u201cHow does giving us a portal which allows us to read information and support our children\u2019s learning give us a voice?\u201d The challenge of engaging parents in issues of governance is a long-running one. Knights highlights the fact that most schools already offer a parents\u2019 portal, and they are often underused. Others try to gather views through surveys, but response rates can vary. Even in schools where attendance at parents\u2019 evening is high, she says, it can be difficult to instigate meaningful discussion on topics such as curriculum changes and extra-curricular offerings. There can be a number of reasons for this; some parents don\u2019t feel equipped to challenge the status quo, while many are just too busy. The NGA has been trying to update its briefings on the topic with examples of good practice, but is struggling to get hold of examples. \u201cWe\u2019ve put a call-out if people are doing parent engagement well, not in terms of individual children, but holding schools to account, and let\u2019s just say we\u2019re not being flooded with responses,\u201d Knights says. \u201cThe establishment isn\u2019t set up to help schools do this in a way that\u2019s meaningful rather than tokenistic. There will be some schools doing it well, but there isn\u2019t knowledge of how to do this properly across the system.\u201d The school governors series is funded by Zurich Municipal.

"19||Antisemitism row makes no mark in Sheffield as voters focus on cutsWhile allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party\u2019s ranks have dominated the political news agenda, there is little evidence that the story has had any impact on the people of Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough. Gill Furniss, Labour\u2019s candidate in the constituency\u2019s byelection on Thursday, says the latest row to engulf the party in Westminster does not come up on the doorstep and that very few people even mention Jeremy Corbyn. The election is instead being fought on local issues, she says, such as the future of the city\u2019s steel industry \u2013 which at one time employed most people in the constituency \u2013 potholes and disability benefit cuts. Furniss was selected to be Labour\u2019s candidate in March, a month after the death of her husband, the previous MP Harry Harpham, following a short battle with cancer. Harpham, a former coal miner, won the seat in May\u2019s general election, taking over from the former Labour home secretary David Blunkett, who had represented the constituency since 1987. Furniss is the daughter of a steel worker and has lived and worked in the constituency \u2013 as a librarian and administrator at the local Northern General hospital \u2013 almost all her life. Harpham was Blunkett\u2019s agent for nearly 20 years before entering parliament. \u201cI\u2019ve been out campaigning in this area every May for 20 years,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just what we do, what I do, what me and Harry did. He wouldn\u2019t expect anything less of me.\u201d Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough is the archetypal Labour safe seat. The current boundaries were drawn up in 2010, after the Boundary Commission for England recommended that Sheffield Brightside take in part of the Sheffield Hillsborough constituency, which was then abolished. Largely white and working-class, but with substantial Asian and black communities, the area has been represented by Labour since 1935. In May, Harpham won 56.6% of the vote, with the Ukip candidate John Booker coming a distant second with 22.1%. The Conservatives came third with 11%, and the Liberal Democrats fourth with 4.5%. The candidates on this occasion all have strong local ties. Ukip\u2019s Steven Winstone is a local businessman and scrap metal dealer who was the party\u2019s candidate for Sheffield South East at the general election. The Lib Dems\u2019 Shaffaq Mohammed has been a councillor for 11 years and is popular locally, while the Conservatives\u2019 Spencer Pitfield is director of the new Conservative Trade Unionists organisation and has stood for parliament in Sheffield twice before. Furniss, who has been out campaigning every day since being nominated, describes herself as cautiously optimistic that Labour will win on Thursday. \u201cSheffield is a Labour city,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that there are no Tories on the council. They\u2019re just not trusted in this city.\u201d Jean Chadburn, 82, is pleased to see Furniss when she knocks on her door on a quiet bank holiday Monday in the Firth Park area of the constituency. She says she\u2019s lived in the area all her life but has never met a Labour politician before. \u201cNormally you never see them, you just hear about them, but I always have voted Labour,\u201d she said, though she sounds a little unsure about whether she\u2019ll make it out to cast her ballot. Shadab Ahmed, 30, who teaches computer science at a local secondary school, will also vote Labour. \u201cThe Conservatives think more about the rich than the poor and I class myself more as poor \u2026 [Labour is] more beneficial for the wider community,\u201d he says. Winstone, who describes himself as \u201cabout as left as you get for a Ukipper\u201d, says he is exasperated by the extent of Labour loyalty in the area. He says the views of constituency members match well with those of his party - the level of anti-EU feeling seems high - but that they vote Labour out of habit. He says Ukip could win support in the Page Hall area of the city, where tensions between local people, many of whom are black and Asian, and new Roma migrants from Slovakia are running high. He says, however, that his party\u2019s ability to provide a real challenge to Labour has been diminished by the fact that the byelection coincides with so many other election battles. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be tough and I\u2019m not going to set myself up for a fall,\u201d he says. \u201cI do think that if this election wasn\u2019t held on the same day as all the other elections and we could get the full Ukip party machine in Hillsborough and Brightside then we could have a good chance of winning.\u201d Although Labour is confident and Ukip less so, both candidates acknowledge that byelections can throw up surprising results. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to keep fighting for every vote,\u201d says Furniss. \u201cYou always have to, in every election.\u201d"
"19||Chilcot report will not be published until after EU referendumThe Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war will not be published until after the EU referendum, Downing Street has confirmed. Ministers had previously said the report by Sir John Chilcot would appear in the summer, amid pressure for publication as soon as it is handed over to the government. In the firmest timetable so far, David Cameron told MPs on Wednesday that it would be \u201cnot too much longer\u201d after the EU referendum on 23 June. That would be almost exactly seven years after the inquiry was ordered by Labour prime minister Gordon Brown in late July 2009. In a response to a question from Tory backbencher David Amess about whether his 100-year-old mother could expect to live to see the report as well as the EU referendum, the Cameron said: \u201cI think I can reassure Maud that this summer she\u2019ll have I think a double opportunity to deal with these things, a referendum on 23 June, and I\u2019m sure the Chilcot report will come not too much longer after that.\u201d Downing Street sources later confirmed that July was the most likely timing for the publication. The report is shortly to undergo security vetting, which should take about two weeks. There is nothing in purdah rules that mean it cannot be published before the EU referendum, but publication before 23 June would be an unhelpful distraction for the government during the campaign. David Davis, the Conservative MP, has described it as \u201cincomprehensible and unacceptable\u201d that the report cannot be released in early May and questioned why Chilcot could not just \u201cpress send\u201d. The Chilcot report is more than 2 million words in length and is likely to contain a damning critique of military commanders, Tony Blair, former ministers, intelligence officers and top officials."
"6||The Vanishing Futurist by Charlotte Hobson review \u2013 a carnival ride through revolutionary RussiaIn September 1991 Charlotte Hobson, a student of Russian at Edinburgh University, went to study in Voronezh for her year abroad. A decade later she published Black Earth City, an account of her months spent living in Russia\u2019s provincial heartland during the year in which the Soviet Union was finally dismembered, the former dependent states breaking away like the fragmentation of a giant iceberg. Hobson\u2019s award-winning memoir, as dreamily lyrical and pragmatic as any Russian novel, beautifully captured the uncertainty, chaos and infectious euphoria of the end of the cold war. Fifteen years on, and Hobson has turned to fiction to examine perhaps the most epoch-defining point in Russia\u2019s history \u2013 the revolutions of 1917, the dissolution of tsarist rule, the Bolshevik rising, subsequent civil war and its aftermath \u2013 choosing a protagonist who, like Hobson herself in Black Earth City, is an English outsider in Russia during a period of turbulence and wild optimism. The result is a rapturous, carnival-like ride into political disorder, heady romance and absurdity as one societal infrastructure is dismantled and replaced with another. Gerty Freely, a \u201cbookish, scrawny girl\u201d, leaves her stifling Edwardian background to take up a position as governess to the Kobelev family of No 7, Gagarinsky Lane, Moscow. It is May 1914; with the outbreak of the first world war a few months later, Gerty is unable to return to England, even if she wanted to. Her home is now with the liberal Kobelevs, including the four Kobelev children at varying stages of precociousness, presided over by a benevolent paterfamilias, a largely absent invalid mother, an ancient aunt and a French former governess. Of the children, the elder two \u2013 restless Sonya and laconic Pasha, whose English is inflected with a Scottish accent courtesy of Gerty\u2019s predecessor \u2013 are only slightly younger than Gerty and will play a significant role as the novel develops. The other member of the household, aside from a myriad of servants, is the Kobelevs\u2019 lodger Nikita Slavkin, a fledgling quantum physicist. Slavkin\u2019s extraordinary ambition for a utopian state based on scientific advances will turn out to be both a prefiguring and a tragic reckoning. Hobson\u2019s portrayal of middle-class Moscow life before the revolution is as delicately reimagined as Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s exquisite The Beginning of Spring, set at the same place and time. Similarly, the decline of old Russia \u2013 represented in the Kobelev household by the ageing Mamzelle and aunt Anna Vladimirovna \u2013 contrasts with the exuberant literary salons and free love movement of the time. This flourishing of the creative arts was, as Hobson explains in the novel\u2019s afterword, an alchemisation of avant-garde talents which culminated in the punkish futurists, intent on staging a vigorous battle against the established order much as the collective Pussy Riot has done in recent years under Putin. Following the events of 1917 and the rejection of the bourgeoisie, anything seemed possible. In a matter of months the Kobelevs leave Moscow for exile in Crimea and eventually Europe; throughout the intense white nights of the summer of 1918, Gerty, who has elected to remain in Gagarinsky Lane with the old ladies, is seduced by Nikita, who spends his days experimenting with building an ever more outlandish series of \u201cpsychotechnological devices\u201d to aid the reformation of society, such as a travelling Propaganda Machine to \u201cvaccinate\u201d citizens against falling back into the trappings of bourgeois existence. Upon the unexpected return of Sonya and Pasha to Moscow, a commune \u2013 the Institute of Revolutionary Transformation \u2013 is eagerly set up on Gagarinsky Lane, with Slavkin at its head. This attempt at forming a mini-republic \u2013 the collectivisation of belongings, daily exercises, minuscule food rations (becoming ever more scarce as famine bites Moscow) and a typically hypocritical ban on sex \u2013 is described with irreverence and some admiration by Hobson. For the young communards, the project swiftly turns sour with leadership battles, bullying, the unsavoury whiff of a cult and a tense m\u00e9nage a quatre at its centre. The enigmatic Slavkin, a mix of dubious crank and visionary, will in later years be virtually canonised as a hero of communism. For now, caught up in the paranoia of the civil war, with its black-market ethos and ready informants, he is seen as a dangerous counterrevolutionary. Hobson doesn\u2019t quite convince with her depiction of Slavkin and his constantly evolving time machine, an improbable precursor of the USSR\u2019s later battle in the space race. What is conveyed most affectingly, with all the reviving powers of a shot of Armenian brandy, is the exhilaration and promise of a dream, an exceptional historical moment that continues to reverberate today. \u2022 To order The Vanishing Futurist for \u00a313.59 (RRP \u00a316.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

"36||The Fault in Our Stars by John Green - reviewThe Fault In Our Stars is a novel written by John Green, a renowned author of Young Adult fiction. The story gives an account of Hazel, who can hardly remember life without cancer and has almost given up hope on her life. She then meets Augustus Waters, a cancer survivor, who reads her favourite books for her and hangs out with her and this helps her to gather strength. The two of them deal with cancer and love. The story is written in a breathtaking way which makes us become a part of the characters and feel the same emotions. Hazel and Augustus appeal to readers through their sense of humour and their courage. But behind this courage, both of them hide their pain to protect their families. John Green, through Hazel and Augustus, brings both: tears and laughter. The Fault in Our Stars is a beautiful novel and I would recommend it to anyone who believes in love and has the courage to fight for it. Through this book I realised that cancer not just touches victims, but it also touches all those who love. Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read?

"0||What is Sanders\u2019 route to the Democratic nomination?Despite Bernie Sanders\u2019 surprise victory in Indiana, the Democratic race is fundamentally unchanged \u2013 Hillary Clinton looks near-certain to be the nominee. To reverse his fortunes, Sanders has to prove the polls wrong. A lot wrong. To pick up the 973 pledged delegates he needs to cross the finish line, Sanders will need to win every remaining Democratic primary. Polling however suggests he might not win any. The Vermont senator needs to capture about two-thirds of the remaining pledged delegates. No numbers are available for the primaries that will be held in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Oregon and Kentucky, partly because pollsters know the voters there won\u2019t change the political calculus much \u2013 they\u2019re not \u201cwasting\u201d their time in places with few delegates available. But where opinion polls are available, they show Sanders trailing Clinton in New Jersey and, crucially, California. Just as for Republicans, California will be decisive in the Democratic race since it offers 546 delegates. Sanders will need to win the majority to have a chance of securing the nomination but he has an approximately nine percentage point gap to close on Clinton. And in New Jersey, he will have to erase Clinton\u2019s 16 percentage point lead, then overtake her by at least 16 percentage points (and all that in a month: the state votes on 7 June). Sanders finished Tuesday night with 52.5% of the vote and 43 delegates. However, Democratic primaries are not winner-takes-all and so Clinton\u2019s vote share in Indiana translated into 37 delegates. In terms of net differences, the only ones that matter in primary races, Sanders only won six extra delegates \u2013 and that simply isn\u2019t enough given that Clinton is ahead by 321 pledged delegates and by 481 superdelegates. Despite this, it seems unlikely that Sanders will drop out of the Democratic race until he has no choice. And there seems to be party consensus that this is a good thing; a poll released this week by NBC News and Survey Monkey found that 57% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want Sanders to stay in the race until the convention."
"6||Simon Armitage webchat \u2013 your questions answered on poetry, austerity and Beyonc\u00e9Thanks so much to Simon for his answers to your questions. His translation of the medieval English poem Pearl is published this month by Faber. Look out next week for webchats with Louis Theroux and Underworld, announced in the coming days. RaoulChateaubriand asks: I worry what long-term effects (as well as short-term) the austerity policies of this government will have on the wellbeing of the nation. Things like the arts seem to be relegated more than ever. I would be interested to hear your take on what effect you think all this might be having on today\u2019s poets and on the poets of the future. PurpleShark asks: Walking Home is an inspirational read and audiobook. What are the plans for recording more of your work i.e. All Points North (please!), Seeing Stars (again yes please!). Subject to no dodgy back (and a good supply of diclofenac) when is the next walk? (Keen to join the taxomomy of fellow hikers!) Throthelookingglass asks: How\u2019s your dad Peter doing? I worked with him at Ashton [also was at his retirement do] :) tom black asks: Does Oxbridge strangle UK culture? ewanbarr asks about Simon\u2019s band: Did Morrissey ever tell you what he thinks of The Scaremongers? I remember that when you interviewed him for the Guardian a few years ago, you hid a CD in the book of poetry you gave him. Siobhan007 asks: Dear Mr Armitage, I really liked your poem The Manhunt, and I wondered if you found it easy to write it from the point of view of the wife? Would you say that you are sending an anti-war message in your poetry, or concentrating more on the individual tragedies resulting from war, or both? Also, I\u2019m intrigued by the title of this poem as it usually suggests something very aggressive, and yet here the wife\u2019s attitude is very tentative. Could you say why you chose this title? Is it to suggest that the poor man is so badly hurt mentally and physically that even being close to his own wife is as difficult as being the object of a manhunt? Thank you. Joe Bradbury asks: The sonnets in Book Of Matches are meant to be read in the same amount of time it would take for a match to be lit and burn out...Will cook\u2019s matches do or will this ruin the overall rhythm and flow of the work? kamski asks: What inspired your poem \u2018Back in the Early Days of the Twenty-First Century\u2019? Is it in any way an attempt to give a voice to a Mumbai street-seller? lordbasil asks: Simon, I was born &amp; grew up in Marsden &amp; am roughly the same age as you - I found it a magical place to inhabit as a young kid and it developed my love of the outdoors &amp; the emotions it can stir within - what effect did this place have on you &amp; did it inspire &amp; influence your work? DrWhatson asks: Were you the one who took \u201cThe Catch\u201d? One of my favourite poems by the way. GlobalViewpoint asks: What word rhymes with \u201cOrange\u201d? You\u2019re a poet, you should know! ElinHanff asks: As a nine year old child I wrote (among many other things) a whole cycle of poems about the birth of Christ. And was allowed to read them aloud to the form below mine. Can you beat this for utter ghastliness? Please say yes. If necessary, lie. Hootsmon asks: What is your favourite limerick? plymgary asks: What are your thoughts on Beyonce? kbg541 asks: What does a poet do all day? Larkin suggested that no poets could reasonably writer for more than two hours a day - and spend the rest of it getting into trouble. runnel asks: Seeing him as a literary figure has even led some minor poets- Simon Armitage, who he?- to write condescending \u2018appreciations\u2019 of his art from a supposedly empathetic position. But then, as Nietszche well knew, \u2018Commmunication is only possible between equals.\u2019 - From Revolution In The Air: The Songs of Bob Dylan 1957-1973, by Clinton Heylin, 2009 On reading this I knew who you were, you were the man I\u2019d listened to as a lad who read poems on the Mark Radcliffe show, sentences like \u201cNot skin but rind\u201d in a particular tone which stopped me doing what i was doing on a late evening. I wondered what you made of this broadside and here, if it\u2019s not too impertinent, is my chance to ask. Xanthe asks: Would you advise an (almost) unpublished poet to self publish? maciver asks: How are your feet holding up? dis1ney asks: Which contemporary Welsh poet, writing in English and still alive, would you recommend to a reader? (Other than Gillian Clarke). Donald J Makin asks: When I was called a poet I did not like the term as I felt it was sissy and all poets did was wonder round writing about love and feelings. Your poetry changed that. When or how did you know you were poet? Was there a decision that right am a poet or was it more organic? Paperbookworm asks: Hi Simon,there are poems on walls and banners(yours)all over Sheffield. Do you think as Sheffield Uni Poetry Prof you could organise them into a book and maybe add some more? Your biggest fan...in Sheffield. CrazyGuy asks: What inspired the poem Book of Matches? It sounds like it describes a period of turmoil in your life. cookiejar asks: Do you find Huddersfield depressing? poliomaldini asks: What\u2019s your lovely cousin Claire up to now? Worked with her in Bristol and she used to bring the most amazing pasties back from Cornwall. littlshyninman asks: You don\u2019t seem to be a user of Twitter. Your near-contemporary and fellow Yorkshireman Ian McMillan uses it to great effect, tweeting impressions from his early morning stroll. Are you not tempted to use social media to get poetry to a wider audience? Legomaniac asks: What message would you give to GCSE students who are reluctant to access poetry because it is \u2018too hard\u2019? littlshyninman asks: When you started out with books like Zoom! and Kid, you made a big impression for being honest and original - your style used the no-nonsense northern vernacular and your subject was ordinary people doing ordinary things. Nowadays you\u2019re Oxford Professor of Poetry and translate Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Do you still identify with the young poet who wrote about skimming stones and moving furniture or have you discarded him in favour of loftier pursuits? lukebenni asks: Hello Mr Armitage, i\u2019m just from over the hill in Uppermill. I was just pondering, how did you start to get your work out before you became a published poet? pinkroom asks: Why did you spoil all those lovely, timeless, rocks in Yorkshire with your \u201cpoems\u201d? cuniculus asks: Do you read modern poets in any other languages? grundistled asks: I used to receive mail for a previous occupant when I lived in a rented house in Sheffield - a Mr Simon Armitage - I\u2019ve always wondered if it was you. Did you used to live in a very poky terrace in Sandhurst Place, Crookes? Leanne Yauu asks: What has been the most unusual source of inspiration for your poems so far? lotusblue asks: If you were to compile a book of song lyrics that could pass for poetry, which three songs would you put in that book and why? yasminiemouse asks: My AS level English Literature class have been studying your poem \u2018Chainsaw Versus the Pampas Grass\u2019 for our exam in 2 weeks and I would love to know your thoughts on gender inequality? I\u2019d also like to know whether you purposefully presented the chainsaw as man because you feel that the male population are still (to this day) as seen as the more dominant, vigorous sex or if you presented the chainsaw as violent to reflect the stereotype that \u2018all\u2019 men are seen as \u2018superior\u2019. Thoughts??? Marcus Hoffman asks: Would you accept the role of poet laureate if it was offered or turn it down? Louie_E_Bell asks: Which poets were you influenced by? (I always keep the collected Hardy by my bedside) davidcrane asks: Do you feel a sort of psychic rivalry with Ted Hughes? The thought crossed my mind, reading one of your Stanza Stones poems on a bleak day above the Aire Valley. DebbiChelsea asks: What are you most passionate about? MichaelMolyneux again, with this question: Do you not think that poets have an obligation to tackle the big philosophical questions - existence, reality, the human condition - rather than merely sketching the quirkiness of humdrum British life? MichaelMolyneux asks: As a rough percentage, how many writers today do you think seek to enhance their ability to see the world more sharply, stripping consciousness bare using techniques such as meditation? Or do you see poetry as more as a craft than a spiritual pursuit? Simon is now answering your questions live. First up is this from Tristan Moss There is probably more poetry being published now than ever before, in online journals, magazines, pamphlets, collections and anthologies. Do you think that the majority of it is good poetry? Or would you agree with Clive James that there is good and bad poetry and to much of what is published today is close to being good? With his ruminations on everything from humdrum British life to ancient Greece and the horrors of war, Simon Armitage is one of Britain\u2019s best-known poets. His work rate is staggering, combining readings with film-making, radio programmes, songwriting, stage productions, teaching at Sheffield university, and, following in the footsteps of Auden and Heaney, lecturing as Oxford Professor of Poetry. As well as new poems reflecting on aerial photographs of the Somme, his latest work is Pearl, a translation of a medieval epic thought to be by the same anonymous author of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, which Armitage has also translated to much acclaim. With Pearl published this month, Armitage joins us to answer your questions about anything in his hugely varied career, in a live webchat from 1.15pm BST onwards on Wednesday 4 May. Post them in the comments below, and he\u2019ll answer as many as possible."
"19||Two women plead not guilty to murder of businesswomanTwo women have pleaded not guilty to the murder of a businesswoman who was found stabbed to death at her home in Lancashire. Sarah Williams and Katrina Walsh are charged with the murder of company director Sadie Hartley, 60, who is believed to have suffered a series of knife wounds to her arms, hands and body. Both defendants appeared via videolink at Preston crown court \u2013 Williams, 34, with dark red shoulder-length hair, wearing a beige suit jacket, from Styal prison in Greater Manchester, and Walsh, 56, dressed all in black with a beanie hat, from New Hall prison in Wakefield. Both defendants answered all questions clearly and appeared composed during the 45-minute hearing, which was attended by Hartley\u2019s family, including her two children, Charlotte and Harry. Another pre-trial hearing will be held on 10 June at the same court. Hartley, a mother of two from Helmshore, Lancashire, ran her own medical communications business, Hartley Taylor, based in Knutsford, Cheshire. It is believed she was last seen alive at a conference in Manchester with a colleague on 14 January."
"7||NBA playoffs finally heat up after Waiters' shove and Lowry's miracle heaveOver 48 hours, the NBA postseason gave us: teams coming back from double-digit deficits, a game-tying buzzer-beater from half-court \u2013 and one of the most confounding final sequences in basketball history. In these four games, the second round of the playoffs might have already given fans as much entertainment value as the entire first round. (Granted, that may not have been a difficult task.) Last night, the Golden State Warriors, still playing without Stephen Curry, came back to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 110-99 despite being down bys 17 points in the first half. In the fourth quarter, the Warriors went on a 9-0 run to tie the game and went on to stifle the Trail Blazers\u2019 offense and win by a comfortable margin. The Warriors now have a 2-0 lead over the Trail Blazers, who had to have felt like they lost their best chance at making this a series. Had the Toronto Raptors not faltered in overtime a few hours earlier, the Warriors\u2019 comeback would only be the second most impressive of the night. At the end of regulation in game 1, the Miami Heat had a six-point lead, and the ball, with only eight seconds remaining. Then, a few Heat blunders allowed the Raptors to trim the lead to three points and get the ball back with just enough time for Kyle Lowry to successfully pull off this miracle heave at the buzzer: Unfortunately for Toronto, the Raptors just couldn\u2019t make far more ordinary shots in overtime, and they ended up merely delaying a 102-96 Heat victory. Yet, even if the Raptors had managed the victory, Lowry\u2019s shot wouldn\u2019t have counted as the biggest shock of the second round so far. The NBA world is still trying to piece together the series of events that unfolded on Monday when the Oklahoma City Thunder tied their series with the San Antonio Spurs. The Thunder managed to become just the second visiting team to win at AT&amp;T Center all season long, emerging with a 98-97 victory after coming out the right side of maybe the most chaotic last 30 seconds in NBA playoff history. Even the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 comparatively unmemorable game 1 win over the Atlanta Hawks wasn\u2019t without intrigue, as it featured the Hawks making up an 18 point deficit and tying the game late in the fourth quarter. Perhaps if Atlanta completed the comeback, like the Warriors, or pulled off a shocking game-tying shot, like the Raptors, it would have fared better in our collective memory. So the second round has been perhaps embarrassingly full of drama so far, despite starting out with relatively ho-hum victories by the Spurs and Warriors in their respective game 1s. Goodness knows the viewing audience deserved these last few nights after putting up with the dreadful first few weeks of the postseason. The opening round of the Western Conference playoffs were particularly perfunctory. The Thunder barely gave the Dallas Mavericks a chance while the Spurs gave the poor, depleted Memphis Grizzlies no chance at all. Injuries to Chris Paul and Blake Griffin effectively ended the more competitive matchup between the Clippers and the Trail Blazers before it really began. Worst yet, the first round gave us five more games of the 2015-16 Houston Rockets, something that nobody wanted \u2013 not even the Rockets. Meanwhile, although the results of the Eastern Conference playoffs were in greater doubt \u2013 well, for everybody but the Detroit Pistons, that is \u2013 it wasn\u2019t particularly a lot of fun getting to them. Most notably, there were times when the Hawks were playing the Boston Celtics when it looked like players were purposely playing ugly offensive basketball to punish the viewing audience for unknown infractions. Normally, it\u2019s a good thing when a NBA postseason series goes seven games, but the one between the Raptors and the Indiana Pacers went didn\u2019t last that long because it was highly contested and more because the teams took turns giving games away. The Heat and the Charlotte Hornets also gave us a peculiarly uninspired seven games, leading to a conclusion where, as Deadspin sharply noted, they \u201cjust barely won a series they dominated.\u201d Ultimately, 90% of the tension and drama in the first round lied in waiting for medical updates. While the rest of the second round can\u2019t possibly keep up on this same pace as far as plot twists go, it certainly already a marked improvement on what\u2019s gone on before. Video of the week OK, there\u2019s no way that we can\u2019t return to that wild finish to Monday\u2019s Game 2 between the Spurs and the Thunder. Here\u2019s how it went down in real time, although honestly, one needs a slew of replays and multiple camera angles to fully get any sort of sense of what happened, exactly. There\u2019s just so much going on here \u2013 maybe too much for the brain to process. Obviously, the big scandal is that the Thunder\u2019s Dion Waiters wasn\u2019t called for an offensive foul after he elbowed Manu Ginobili while inbounding the ball. That\u2019s pretty clear. However, before that happens, Ginobili steps over the line, which he should have been called for a technical for stepping over the line. Obviously, that\u2019s not as visible and egregious as Waiters\u2019s shove, but already it\u2019s easy to see how flat out impossible to officiate all of this is. In fact, the NBA\u2019s officiating report lists five fouls that were missed in the game\u2019s final sequence. This might be a conservative accounting, given that this whole thing feels like one of those \u201chow many things are wrong with this picture\u201d exercises being played out in real-time. For instance, somewhere in the mad scramble of bodies that occurs before time runs out on the Spurs, a fan actually made contact with Thunder center Steven Adams\u2019 arm. There\u2019s a new detail you discover every time you watch it, forcing the internet to reach outside of mere sports history to come up with a suitable comparison. Quote of the week I\u2019m in the game, man. I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s really going on. \u2013 Dion Waiters on that infamous final possession. And that just about sums things up, doesn\u2019t it? How did LeBron carry the Cavaliers this week? LeBron James had a team-high 25 points, nine assists and seven defensive rebounds in what ended up being a tough fought Game 1 victory over the Hawks. Still, as we pointed out, the team needed all that just to hang on, as they surrendered an 18-point lead during the game. Maybe while that was going on, James was just distracted by all of the breaking Space Jam 2 news? Power rankings 1) Golden State Warriors (3) If the Trail Blazers had won Game 2, the narrative almost certainly was going to be \u201cnow with the series potentially in real jeopardy, will Curry attempt to return in time for Saturday\u2019s Game 3.\u201d With a 2-0 cushion, don\u2019t expect the Warriors to rush Curry, who has resumed shooting, back to the court. 2) Cleveland Cavaliers (2) Here\u2019s the other thing about the Cavaliers\u2019 victory over the Hawks: the game-clinching play might have actually been courtesy of Kyrie Irving\u2019s defense. Of all things. 3) San Antonio Spurs (1) If the Spurs had managed to pull off a victory in game 2, or at least lose in a less ridiculous manner, maybe more of us would remember the part of the game where Tony Parker made one of the most ridiculous passes ever: 4) Oklahoma City Thunder (4) Even if more than a few calls went their way at the end of game 2, the Thunder had the better of the Spurs for almost all of the night, and absolutely looked like a team capable of beating them in a seven-game series. 5) Miami Heat (5) The Heat\u2019s savvy probably helped the team shrug off Lowry\u2019s ridiculous game-tying buzzer-beater, but the gaffes that made that shot possible are something they\u2019re going to have to address. \u201cWe had to win the game twice tonight,\u201d noted Dwyane Wade after the game. 6) Toronto Raptors (8) Well, listen: you guys forced overtime. That\u2019s something to fight against the \u201cToronto crumples on the big stage\u201d reputation. Yes, OK, it would have been helpful had you not crumpled in overtime, but it\u2019s progress. 7) Atlanta Hawks (6) Meanwhile, the Hawks didn\u2019t even manage to push overtime. Can they even the series in tonight\u2019s game 2? 8) Portland Trail Blazers (7) Game 2 was their game to win to make this a series. They now have to win both at home and then hope that Curry either doesn\u2019t return too soon or isn\u2019t effective when he does return. It still might not matter."
"3||Alan Rusbridger honoured at British Media AwardsFormer Guardian editor-in-chief Alan Rusbridger is to be recognised for his outstanding contribution to the UK\u2019s media industry at this year\u2019s British Media Awards in London. Iain Brown, general manager of awards organiser, TheMediaBriefing, said Rusbridger was being recognised for his 20 years overseeing the Guardian. Brown said: \u201cDuring that time he was instrumental in defending the Guardian from threats to its existence, from high-profile lawsuits to WikiLeaks, and undeniably helped define and promote the concept of open journalism. \u201cRusbridger, in concert with his team at the Guardian, also helped to pioneer many digital publishing endeavours which we now take for granted, in addition to delivering on the mission of liberal journalism with endeavours such as Wikileaks, [Edward] Snowden, phone-hacking and the Keep It In The Ground campaign. Nobody yet has the answers, but we feel it is important to reward those who take bold steps and who have undeniably changed the media landscape along the way.\u201d Rusbridger stood down as editor of the Guardian in May last year. He is currently principal of Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford University and chair of the Reuters Institute, and is due to take over later this year as chair of the Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the Guardian and the Observer. Last year\u2019s winner was Marjorie Scardino, former chief executive of the Economist and Pearson, which during her tenure was the owner of the Financial Times."
"15||The local elections won\u2019t mark a Lib Dem revival sadly, but there are stirringsI sat opposite someone over dinner last week who offered me a wager that Nick Clegg would still become prime minister. It was an idea he embraced, and I rather agreed with him that Clegg would make an excellent one. I just find it hard to imagine the bundle of circumstances that would allow it to happen. I didn\u2019t take the bet. But I was fascinated by the conversation because it seemed to me to be the first hint of a phenomenon I had been expecting for some time: let\u2019s call it coalition nostalgia. You may not have felt warmly towards them at the time. But, in retrospect, there\u2019s a sense among some voters, and I certainly share it, of a fond memory for those days when the government \u2013 even if it wasn\u2019t exactly on your side \u2013 included checks and balances, and a feeling that some of them were wrestling with the future in an intelligent way. When the inner workings of government were more transparent. Personally, I have a particularly warm glow about 2010-11, when \u2013 just for a moment \u2013 thanks partly to the chaos of the banking crisis, everything briefly seemed possible. It didn\u2019t last, I know. It doesn\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s what makes it possible to be nostalgic about it. A Lib Dem colleague of mine who was a special adviser confided the truth to me at the time. \u201cLabour isn\u2019t the enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even the Conservatives are the enemy; the Treasury is the enemy.\u201d And even if that particular battle was hardly won, it felt refreshing that it was being fought at all. I wish it was now. Now, Liberal Democrats are deeply optimistic people. That is why they hang on in there: the party\u2019s continuing existence is down to a branch of evolution known as \u201csurvival of the most optimistic\u201d. So there are again rising hopes in the Lib Dem camp that tomorrow\u2019s local elections will demonstrate something of a recovery. It is worth putting this into perspective. Michael Thrasher and Colin Rallings, the Plymouth University psephologists, have been predicting a Lib Dem vote share tomorrow of 16%. That would be twice the party\u2019s general election performance and would return them to their electoral appeal of around 2011 too (what was it about 2011?). The trouble is that the last time these particular seats were fought was 2012, when the Lib Dems attracted 15% of the vote. The Lib Dem commentator Mark Pack also points out that Thrasher and Rallings have tended to overestimate the Lib Dem vote by about two percentage points. That would mean that those extra votes may well not translate into extra council seats. Let\u2019s also be clear about Liberal revivals. They date from the Torrington byelection in 1958 and have been reviving and retiring ever since. That was the year I was born, so I have been living my entire life during a slightly unreliable Liberal revival, which kinds of puts any revival into perspective too. They tend to rise when they win (which they haven\u2019t been, God knows). Or when there is a cause celebre that leaves them isolated and on the side of the public (which doesn\u2019t apply now), or when they unambiguously crusade on a cause that is their own. This last one is tough. For some time now, Lib Dems have been torn between the urge to appear safe, respectable and electable, and the equally urgent need for a clear and dominant purpose. These dominant purposes are, by definition, neither safe nor respectable. My guess is that, until they have developed something to say, which has to be distinctive, necessary and relevant to people (in their own estimation) \u2013 until they are clearer about what the party is for \u2013 then no amount of campaigning is going to kickstart that elusive revival again. But, hey, let\u2019s not be downhearted. Ideas take time, and Tim Farron hasn\u2019t even been leader for a year. I am a Liberal Democrat and therefore optimistic. Even if the Liberal beast slumbers on, there are recent signs of it stirring in its sleep \u2013 the occasional local byelection victory, the influx of members. And if Thrasher and Rallings are right, then 16% would be a doubling of their vote share from last year. It won\u2019t be a Liberal revival exactly, but it should be enough to remind the body politic that there is a Liberal beast sleeping, like King Arthur, waiting until its nation\u2019s hour of need."
"18||Dugdale: antisemitism row damaging Scottish Labour's election hopesKezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, has admitted the furore over antisemitism within Labour after Ken Livingstone\u2019s remarks last week has damaged her party\u2019s chances in Thursday\u2019s Scottish parliament election. With Scottish Labour neck and neck with the Tories in Holyrood polling, Dugdale told the Guardian that voters were raising the controversy on the doorstep in the final days of the campaign. \u201cIt has unquestionably had an effect. I\u2019m not going to go into the business of analysing what has happened over the past few days but it is coming up on the doorsteps,\u201d she said, as she campaigned in the target seat of Edinburgh Southern. Her disclosure came as all the Scottish party leaders launched their final push for votes before election day, with Nicola Sturgeon addressing Scottish National party supporters near the statue of former first minister Donald Dewar in central Glasgow. Sturgeon, who is thought to fear her party may not win an overall majority despite the SNP\u2019s substantial lead in the polls, urged her supporters to cast both their constituency and list votes for the SNP. Calling on them to ignore appeals from the pro-independence Scottish Greens to give them their second votes, Sturgeon said SNP voters should \u201cleave nothing to chance\u201d. She appealed for \u201ca personal mandate as first minister to reform and to transform Scotland for the future\u201d. Labour strategists fear the antisemitism row, which dominated media coverage last week after Livingstone, the former London mayor, was confronted by Labour MP John Mann, has severely hit their bid to hold Eastwood constituency near Glasgow. The seat, which mirrors the former East Renfrewshire seat lost last year by the former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, is home to Scotland\u2019s largest Jewish community and has been held by Labour\u2019s Ken Macintosh since Dewar established the Scottish parliament in 1999. It is seen as a three-way marginal, and a potential gain for the Scottish Tories, whose recent surge in the polls is now threatening to knock Labour into third place. The loss of Eastwood would badly dent Labour\u2019s hopes of remaining Holyrood\u2019s second largest party. Some constituency Labour parties have seen members resign over the controversy. Insisting she was going to \u201ckeep smiling\u201d, Dugdale said she had chosen not to raise it in a phonecall with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, on Tuesday because it \u201cwould not have added anything\u201d to her update on the Scottish campaign. She added: \u201cI\u2019m going to carry on doing what I have always done in this campaign, which is to make a positive case for how we can use the powers of the Scottish parliament to make different choices from the Tories in Scotland.\u201d In parallel developments, the SNP barred a Muslim leader in Edinburgh, Amjed Hussain, from further party events for allegedly posting offensive anti-Jewish material on Facebook. Although not a party member, Hussain was photographed with Sturgeon at her manifesto launch and has campaigned for the SNP. Scottish Labour then suspended councillor Terry Kelly in Renfrewshire after the Conservative blogger Guido Fawkes disclosed allegedly antisemitic posts dating back to 2010 which attacked the \u201cJewish lobby\u201d in the US. Both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats believe they will increase their number of seats at Holyrood. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, launched her final day push at Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Botanic Garden. Appealing to new voters who were born after Scotland won devolution in 1999 to back the Tories, Davidson said: \u201cThe devolution generation deserves better. [As] our country\u2019s strong opposition we\u2019ll make sure Scotland gets the better government is deserves.\u201d Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said his party was confident the final result would confound the party\u2019s poor opinion poll showing. \u201cEverywhere I go, people tell me that they are pleased that we are talking about big issues like education that were neglected while the SNP campaigned for independence,\u201d he said."
"15||In resurrecting Captain Cook\u2019s ship, we can re-examine our colonial pastNews has emerged confirming the whereabouts of the wreckage of HMS Endeavour, a ship sailed by Captain James Cook. Reports invariably contain images of the ship in its pomp, proudly reminding the reader of its British origins and its voyage to the Pacific Ocean, where Cook took possession of Australia. But where should Cook\u2019s ship go? Once we dredge it up, or rather, once the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project dredges it up, where should it be put? And will Cook\u2019s ship be allowed to take us beyond our colonial past? It must be remembered that it is our cultural attachment that will be doing the dredging, our obsession and fascination with these objects that circulate as evidence of the all-powerful histories of empire. Where we decide to put Cook\u2019s ship and its contents will shape where it takes us. Through its presentation we will relate to it culturally; as an object of desire or fascination for some, and boredom for others. We will tell a new story and it will make us feel something. Many of the Anglo-American and Australian public are likely to feel awe in the presence of the Endeavour. As we stand before it, in whatever state it is in (probably not wrecked but reconstructed to its \u201coriginal\u201d form), it is unlikely to rouse anything like the grief that has ripped the souls of millions of Indigenous Australians. Especially if we preserve it, present it and interpret it as part of the British Museum\u2019s set. This is not to say that the ship should become an opportunity for apology or sympathetic feeling. In Australia many Indigenous activists, public intellectuals and academics tell us that they aren\u2019t interested in sympathy or other paternalistic emotions \u2013 an attitude that will be no surprise to those familiar with public forums such as the Guardian column IndigenousX. Which should not be to dismiss the historical value of saying sorry, either. And it certainly isn\u2019t to speak on behalf of Indigenous people \u2013 as if I ever could. It is merely to say that we are all looking forward as well as back, that life is moving on despite us, and we need to move things on too, in a way that changes the story. A story that until now has been that of \u201cthe famous British explorer\u201d. A story that is in fact one of colonial rule, whiteness, and Indigenous sovereignty. A story in which we are all intertwined. There is no such thing as \u201cthis side of the world\u201d. The world isn\u2019t made up of sides. Australia is very much \u201chere\u201d \u2013 Britons hear the accents, buy the products, watch the TV. And we are very much \u201cthere\u201d \u2013 we fill the tourism ventures, go backpacking, populate their ABC with our BBC. We export our media. And in return Australia gave us The Conversation. The resurrection of Cook\u2019s ship is taking place here, in our shared world; the one without sides. This is why much academic literature refers to the colonial past as a \u201cpresent\u201d, to recognise how what is happening now continually remakes the effects of the past. Perhaps what should be most worrying is that the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project \u201cis launching a campaign to finance the construction of a storage facility to accommodate the objects\u201d. Is it so hard to imagine that the ship should be placed in the hands of a co-operative of First Nations organisations rather than stay with those that will pander to a whitewashed version of history? As ever, we entrust our history to scientists, sometimes governments and corporations, rather than to those who produce counter-narratives that could unsettle our place in the world. How we choose to open up the Endeavour to modern interpretation will dictate how much opportunity there is for new stories to be told, for the familiar narratives of a heroic Captain Cook to be subverted by the imperialistic reality. It is hard not be cynical about the possible resting place for this famous old ship. My girlfriend jokes about an auction on eBay. I have a vision of a jolly theme park, Cook\u2019s vessel digitally mediated with fancy holograms, all the better to distract from the reality of the Endeavour\u2019s colonial past."
"12||John Boyega to star on stage in Old Vic's WoyzeckJohn Boyega is temporarily hanging up his lightsaber and will, presumably, use more earthly implements when he stars as the murdering military barber Woyzeck in a newly announced London stage production. The Old Vic\u2019s artistic director, Matthew Warchus, announced his second season in charge on Wednesday with productions that will include Glenda Jackson as King Lear and a revival of the west end hit Art. But it is the inclusion of Star Wars star Boyega which may generate the most excitement. The 24-year-old actor from Peckham, south-east London, who became a global name with his role as rebel stormtrooper Finn in JJ Abrams\u2019 rebooted Star Wars franchise, is to star in a new version of Woyzeck written by Jack Thorne. Georg B\u00fcchner\u2019s Woyzeck, unfinished on his death in 1837 and first published in 1879, is widely regarded as the first \u201cmodern\u201d drama. It is based on the true story of a military barber who stabbed to death his mistress in a fit of jealousy and was sentenced to death in 1821. The work is far more than a study of violence prompted by sexual rage. \u201cIn B\u00fcchner\u2019s fragmented scenes it becomes something else altogether,\u201d wrote the Guardian\u2019s Michael Billington. \u201cA naturalistic tragedy, a damning social critique, a lower-class King Lear, a debate on free will and determinism.\u201d What the Thorne version for the Old Vic will be remains to be seen. Scheduled to open in March 2017 the theatre would only say that Thorne was breathing new life into \u201cone of the most influential plays ever written, creating for our time what Bu\u0308chner intended for his: an unforgettable howl of rage\u201d. The casting of Boyega, recipient of the 2016 Bafta rising star award, will undoubtedly attract a younger audience to the theatre. His breakthrough role was in Joe Cornish\u2019s 2011 film Attack the Block but it is Star Wars that has brought him worldwide fame. He is currently filming Star Wars: Episode VIII, due for release at the end of 2017. Woyzeck will be by far the biggest stage role to date for Boyega, who trained at the Identity School of Acting in Hackney. His theatre CV includes parts in Six Parties at the National Theatre\u2019s Cottesloe in 2009 and in Roy Williams\u2019s Category B at the Tricycle, also in 2009. The Old Vic also confirmed reports that Jackson would return to the stage more than 25 years after she gave up acting for politics. Jackson, who turns 80 next week, will take on one of the most challenging of all acting roles, playing Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear in a production directed by Deborah Warner. The company will also include Jane Horrocks, Rhys Ifans, Simon Manyonda and Harry Melling and it is due to open in November. Other productions will include Warchus returning to direct Art, to mark the 20th anniversary of a play which became a surprise long-running West End hit. There will also be a world premiere of a monologue by Samuel Beckett, No\u2019s Knife, performed by the Irish actor Lisa Dwan; and a puppetry show called Missing Light created by Mark Arends, as part of a new programme of children\u2019s theatre at the Old Vic. Warchus, who succeeded Kevin Spacey at the helm last year, said: \u201cAnyone who has visited The Old Vic in the last eight months will have felt the new wave of energy which has swept through the building. \u201cThere\u2019s a completely fresh feel to the foyer, bars and cafe, and a completely fresh approach to how we programme our productions and events. There\u2019s much more happening, and for a much wider range of people. For a theatre without public funding this is no mean feat. It\u2019s an exciting shift, aimed at consolidating the Old Vic as a vibrant and indispensable part of London\u2019s artistic scene. \u201cWith my second season, we continue our mission to be a leading creative hub in the capital, and further afield, radiating an energising and unintimidating spirit, as we celebrate the best of what theatre can be.\u201d"
"6||Quidditch World Cup 2016 hopes to feature first African teamA crowdfunding campaign aiming to make Uganda the first African team to compete in the Quidditch World Cup has more than quadrupled its goal, less than two weeks after launch. The worldwide quidditch tournament is due to take place on 23 and 24 July in Frankfurt. The competition, run by the International Quidditch Association, has taken place biennially since 2012, with the US winning the 2014 championship (the UK came fourth). It is based on the game made famous in JK Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter books \u2013 both versions take place on broomsticks, although broomsticks in the real world have so far stubbornly refused to fly. Both versions feature seven players on each side, with a team consisting of one keeper, three chasers, two beaters and one seeker. Chasers attempt to throw a ball known as a \u201cquaffle\u201d (in the real world, a semi-deflated volleyball) through hoops, with beaters throwing \u201cbludgers\u201d (fully-inflated dodgeballs) at other players, and seekers attempting to catch the \u201csnitch\u201d (\u201ca sock with a tennis ball in it, attached to the snitch runner\u2019s shorts\u201d). Team Uganda originally set out to raise \u20ac1,500 on Indiegogo to get to the event, an amount that it hit just 16 hours after launching its campaign \u2013 and which will be matched by the International Quidditch Association. The total raised now stands at almost \u20ac7,000, but the team needs to make nearly \u20ac15,000 to get to Germany. \u201cTeam Uganda still need so much more support. The flights alone number in the tens of thousands. But we are hopeful,\u201d said tournament director Matthew Guenzel. \u201cThe quidditch community is very supportive, and this is a great cause.\u201d Organisers said that if the Ugandan team successfully raises the money, this summer will be the first time an African team has attended an international quidditch event. Including Uganda, 24 teams from countries including South Korea and Pakistan are registered to play in the championship. \u201cUp to this point, most international quidditch teams have been from western countries \u2013 Europe and North America. With this campaign, we have a real chance to broaden the spectrum of teams attending the event,\u201d says the Indiegogo campaign, which still has a month to run."
"0||'We're like second-class citizens': Flint's struggle continues as Obama visitsSince 12-year-old Flint resident Jeremiah Loren contracted a debilitating bacterial infection that has rankled his stomach, his grades have dropped dramatically, he\u2019s missed four months of school this year, and there are days he doesn\u2019t even get out of bed. Jeremiah, who has tested positive for elevated blood lead levels, first contracted the infection a few months after Flint switched its water supply to a corrosive local river. His mother, Tammy Loren, attributes his illness directly to the Michigan city\u2019s contaminated water supply. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way for him to [have] contracted it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has abdominal pains so bad where he can\u2019t get up out of bed. He\u2019s constantly fatigued and dizzy.\u201d As Barack Obama treks north to Flint on Wednesday at the behest of an eight-year-old resident, he\u2019ll be greeted by a city ensnared in a cascade of ongoing issues similar to the Lorens\u2019. The water crisis, now entering its third year, has done more than shatter residents\u2019 trust in their government; there are potentially long-term health consequences, a lack of funding to remove the network of lead piping, and an unnerving reliance on bottled water, as officials have yet to declare it\u2019s safe for residents to drink their tap water without a filter. \u201cThey don\u2019t give a damn about us and they ain\u2019t been giving a damn about us,\u201d said Nayyirah Shariff, 39, an activist and member of the Flint Democracy Defense League. \u201cLike we\u2019re a poor community, so they\u2019re like screw poor people \u2026 screw people of color? They just don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d Republican governor Rick Snyder, who first publicly admitted six months ago that Flint residents had been exposed to high levels of lead in the water supply, has repeatedly apologized for his administration\u2019s role in the crisis but has sought to distance himself from criticism for his months-long delay. On Monday, the governor traveled to Flint \u2013 without notifying the public \u2013 to meet a restaurant owner and speak about what had been accomplished to address the crisis. But two years after a Snyder-appointed emergency manager oversaw the city\u2019s transition to drawing its water from the the Flint river, prompting widespread complaints about discolored and smelly water, residents say the effort has been wholly inadequate. What\u2019s more, they say, there remains a disconnect from the needs of the majority-black city, where more than 40% of residents live below the poverty line. \u201cFor me, the way that you act, it determines your values and what you hold important,\u201d Shariff said. \u201cThe fact there still hasn\u2019t been a proper response to this is absolutely insulting. We\u2019re just like second-class citizens.\u201d Flint\u2019s water supply became contaminated with lead in April 2014, after the source of the city\u2019s drinking water was switched from Lake Huron to the Flint river. Water from the Flint river had for months corroded lead from inside of water pipes before flowing into households across the city. Nearly $70m has so far been appropriated by the state to reconnect Flint with Detroit\u2019s water system, conduct testing for lead and provide bottled water to residents. The governor activated the national guard to assist in the state\u2019s response. An additional $165m has been proposed for further measures and a federal declaration of a state of emergency meant $5m in additional federal aid. Snyder said on Tuesday that he expected the state legislature to approve expanded Medicaid coverage for children and adults up to age 21, but lawmakers have delayed approving the measure for more than two months. Other residents pointed to the lack of bottled water delivery to homes, forcing many to amend their daily routine to travel to pick up bottled water at fire stations across the city. \u201cIf they really wanted to have an authentic response, [then] why do we have to drive around and get water?\u201d said Shariff. \u201cWhy do they wait over two months for Medicaid expansion.\u201d One of the major priorities of Flint mayor Karen Weaver has been replacing all of the lead pipes in the city to prevent leaching from those that have been irreparably corroded. Flint has replaced lead service lines for 33 homes since Weaver launched a local effort in March, and officials are preparing efforts for 400 additional homes, said Kristin Moore, spokesperson for Weaver\u2019s office. But Weaver estimates the city would need $55m that it doesn\u2019t have to complete pipe replacement. Snyder told reporters this week that the state is \u201cgoing to continue to help get the lead service lines out\u201d, and about $2m has been appropriated for the effort \u2013 enough to remove about 500 lines in a city that has been estimated to have about 15,000. \u201cThe city has been waiting for state and federal lawmakers to pass bills that would cover the $55m cost of replacing every lead-tainted service line in Flint,\u201d said Moore. \u201cIt no doubt would lower the per-home cost to replace the pipes if contractors were bidding on $55m worth of work rather than $2m.\u201d Though Obama\u2019s visit has created a glimmer of optimism, some believe the trip should have occurred months ago. The president was in Detroit for the North American International Auto Show in January, where he addressed the \u201cterrible tragedy\u201d of Flint. \u201cI feel like Obama should\u2019ve been here,\u201d said Nakiya Wakes, 40, a resident and activist. \u201cIt took a little girl to write him for him to come.\u201d Shariff agreed, but said the president\u2019s visit speaks volumes about Michigan\u2019s governor, who has yet to hold a public forum to meet with residents impacted by the crisis. \u201cWhat does it say that Obama lives in the White House in DC, and he can meet with Flint residents before Snyder can?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he lives 40 minutes away in Ann Arbor.\u201d It\u2019s the role of Snyder, who installed a succession of four emergency managers to address Flint\u2019s finances, that draws the most vocal criticism in the city of 100,000. The governor has rebuffed calls to resign, even as the crisis prompted a recall petition. The 57-year-old former venture capitalist, who won the 2010 gubernatorial race without ever having served in office, has attempted to pin blame for the crisis on \u201ccareer bureaucrats\u201d who interpreted federal lead regulations too narrowly. But a Snyder-appointed taskforce reviewing what happened in Flint found, in March, that the state\u2019s role was the most significant in causing the crisis. The report highlighted the numerous instances when Snyder\u2019s top aides expressed alarming concerns about Flint\u2019s water supply, long before the governor acknowledged it wasn\u2019t safe for Flint residents to drink. The delayed response in conducting a timely review of the system could result in a $1bn price tag from multiple lawsuits that have been filed at the state and federal level. Civil fines may also be levied as a result of an investigation by Michigan\u2019s attorney general, who has already charged two state environmental officials and a Flint employee with multiple felonies. The investigation, along with nearly a dozen other probes, is still pending. Snyder tapped more than $1m in public funds for criminal and civil attorneys to assist in his office\u2019s response to the litigation and public records requests, but his spokesperson has said there won\u2019t be a \u201cneed\u201d for a criminal defense. Snyder has been chided by critics for using public funds in that capacity, especially as Flint residents call for additional funding to address the water crisis. \u201cHe may be the singularly most tone deaf politician that I have ever known in my career,\u201d said Flint\u2019s congressional representative, Dan Kildee. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in his heart. But based on what he says and what he does, he just doesn\u2019t get it. This is a community in crisis, and what we don\u2019t need is an accountant\u2019s calculation as to the minimum amount of support that he can provide.\u201d The governor is expected to meet with Obama on Wednesday, according to his spokesperson. Details have yet to be confirmed. Snyder has tried to encourage Flint residents in recent weeks that tap water is safe to drink, if filtered, by drinking the city\u2019s water himself. But for Wakes, the move has her feeling d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - Flint\u2019s former mayor uttered a similar refrain last summer, as the city\u2019s lead contamination slowly emerged. Wakes recently had her water tested by members of a nonprofit founded by actor Mark Ruffalo \u2013 tests that revealed substantially higher levels of lead than what Michigan\u2019s environmental department found at her home. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve been consuming in these few years that we\u2019ve been drinking this, besides lead, so how can y\u2019all say that the water is safe?\u201d Wakes said."
"4||Leopards have lost 75% of their historical habitatThe area of the world roamed by leopards has declined by three quarters over the last two and a half centuries, according to the most comprehensive effort yet to map the big cat. Researchers said they were shocked by the shrinking of the spotted hunter\u2019s range, and that the decline had been far worse for several of the nine subspecies of leopards and in some parts of the world. \u201cWe found the leopard had lost 75% of its historical habitat, we were blown away by that, it was much more than we feared,\u201d said Andrew Jacobson, a conservationist at the Zoological Society of London and lead author of a new study on their range published in the journal PeerJ. \u201cOur goal has to be to raise consciousness about the plight of the leopard, it\u2019s been flying under the conservation radar for a while. We hoped to raise its profile and say \u2018this cat needs your attention\u2019.\u201d The new work is the first known attempt to draw up a global, historical map of the leopard. Jacobson and researchers found that in 1750 it occupied a vast 35m sq km (13.5m sq mile) area throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia. But after centuries of habitat loss and hunting caused by humans, that area shrank to just 8.5m sq km. Leopards in Asia have been particularly badly hit, with six regions losing over 95% of habitat where the species has been, in Jacobson\u2019s view, \u201calmost completely wiped out\u201d. There appeared to be a clear link between Asia\u2019s economic development and the leopard\u2019s decline there, he said. \u201cSouth-east Asia and China have been developed for a long period of time and that\u2019s seriously constricted habitat in that area for decades. We worry this will be the trend we will see in Africa in coming decades, as economies grow.\u201d Even in Africa, the paper found, losses varied greatly, with their range decreasing 99% in North Africa, up to 95% in West Africa but only up to 51% in Southern Africa. Leopards are a famously reclusive but adaptable species, living nocturnally and hunting a wider variety of prey than other species. They also appear more capable than other big cats at adapting to environments transformed by humans, with leopards living in the outskirts of Mumbai and Johannesburg. There are no reliable population estimates but it is thought there are over a 100,000 left in Africa and perhaps fewer than 10,000 in Asia. Jacobson, who is also part of the National Geographic Society\u2019s Big Cats Initiative, said it was not too late for leopards to bounce back. \u201cI think the leopard can come back. The leopard is an incredibly adaptable animal, we just need to ease off on the hunting pressure, the persecution. They\u2019re cats, they breed pretty well.\u201d But greater conservation efforts were needed to stop them suffering the dramatic declines seen by some other species, he said. \u201cWhen people think of endangered animals they think of tigers, elephants, rhino. Thankfully the leopard isn\u2019t in that category yet, and if we are more proactive about them we can stop them being in there.\u201d The new study \u2013 Leopard (Panthera pardus) status, distribution, and the research efforts across its range \u2013 examined 6,000 records at 2,500 locations, from over 1,300 sources, including other scientific literature and experts\u2019 data, to draw up a detailed reconstruction of leopards\u2019 range today and in 1750."
"37||Modern warfare sucks \u2013 the crisis in first-person shooter gamesEarlier this week, Activision announced the latest title in its multi-gazillion-selling Call of Duty series. Subtitled Infinite Warfare \u2013 a level of titular hyperbole only previously explored by Marvel films and pay-per-view wrestling events \u2013 it takes the action into the far future, and more importantly, into space. The teaser trailer is a bewildering opera of explosions, zero-G dogfights and sociopathic astronaut melee combat \u2013 so it should have dominated online discussion among shooter fans for at least a few hours. But Activision did something unexpected. It announced that an intricately remastered version of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare would be shipping with special editions of the game. While all subsequent Call of Duty titles have longingly harked back to this absolutely seminal FPS title, none so far have more-or-less relied on it for a publicity push. The problem is, Modern Warfare seemed to attract more excitement and discussion than Infinite Warfare. In that moment, it\u2019s arguable the first-person shooter, as a big budget, mainstream concern, crossed over into the nostalgia industry. In music, this happens all the time with bands. At some point, touring becomes not a way to test and celebrate new material, but to appease long-running fans who just want to hear the hits. Sure, they\u2019ll still grudgingly buy the latest release and may concede there are one or two good tracks, but what they really want is that 180g vinyl reissue of the group\u2019s classic album, complete with unreleased tracks and limited edition art card inserts. Eventually, fans of legacy rock acts don\u2019t really want the music anymore, they just want to be young again. We see this too in Doom, Bethesda\u2019s faithful yet graphically hyper-upgraded version of the id Software classic. It is not Doom 4 for a reason. It is not continuation of the evolutionary path that Doom 3 set out on \u2013 it is a reimagining. A reboot. A re-Doom. When the game was shown off at Bethesda\u2019s pre-E3 show last year, it was described on stage with the promise of, \u2018badass demons, big effing guns, and moving really fast\u2019. The choice of words is so telling in a number of ways, but mostly, it\u2019s this: by adopting the language of a teenage boy (even self-censoring the f word), the company was directly speaking to the audience members as they were 20 years ago. It was taking them back to the early nineties. To Wrestlemania and death metal and straight-to-video horror flicks. The Doom of 2016 is not a radical blood-splattered thrill ride, it\u2019s a museum of gore; it\u2019s a National Trust stately home curated by doddering cyber-demons in chunky knit cardigans. A much truer tribute to the aesthetics and mechanics of the original Doom can perhaps be found in Devil Daggers, a stripped down, ridiculously uncompromising blaster that thrusts players into the pit of hell to face eternal waves of monstrous demons. Created by unknown Australian developer Sorath it\u2019s a shameless repackaging of 90s shooter dynamics: no item pick-ups, no character customisation, just wave upon wave of enemy forces and nothing to save the player but quick reflexes. Released in February, it\u2019s become a cult hit, especially on YouTube where gamers show off their mastery of the game\u2019s limited arsenal of moves and weapons. Its leaderboard system and choreographed enemy attack patterns graft on the form and function of arcade shoot-\u2019em-ups, adding extra juice to the retro adrenaline rush. This is nostalgia as masochism. Of course, the idea of grafting new mechanics onto a favourite genre to perk it up a bit is not new \u2013 to use the music comparison again, it\u2019s equivalent to forming a supergroup. So it\u2019s no surprise that two games \u2013 Overwatch (from Blizzard) and Battleborn (from Geabox) \u2013 should come along at roughly the same time with roughly the same idea: first-person shooter meets the multiplayer online battle arena (moba). There have been a lot of fun articles about this crazy coincidence \u2013 the fact that both games merge their team-based approach with wacky characters and oversized weapons \u2013 but there have been just as many pointing to evergreen favourite Team Fortress 2 and old-timers like Timesplitters and Battlefield: Bad Company as the progenators of this hyperreal, comic book super-team approach to FPS functionality. There are no new ideas. OK, we\u2019ve got that. It\u2019s a message that we receive on a daily basis from every cynical media pundit who hasn\u2019t yet, like, totally given up on social media. But there sort of are new ideas. Superhot brilliantly disengages the first-person shooter from its basis in instinctive twitchcore action and turns gunplay into a slow-mo puzzle ballet. Glitchspace is a visually beautiful first-person programming game (!) where you explore and alter a series of sci-fi environments using a visual coding language. Other titles have tried to \u201cgamify\u201d programming before but never in a way that uses a machine language as a weapon and an interface in such an ingenious way. Even Adrift, the weird floating-in-space simulator that divided critics on its release in March had interesting ideas about what it means to embody a character in first-person and to experience an environment that is so utterly alien and unknowable. But these are games at the fringes of the medium. The big question surrounding Modern Warfare is: do people want it back because they miss the purity of what it offered, or because they\u2019re simply nostalgic for a past that involved Modern Warfare and games like it? In February, Derby-based studio Bulkhead Interactive launched a Kickstarter for its game Battalion 1944, a shamelessly retrospective WWII shooter inspired by the glory years of the Medal of Honor and early CoD titles. It pulled in over \u00a3300,000, three-times as much as the team was looking for. It looks good in a re-skinned Battlefield 1942 sort of way, but what does it say about the FPS genre and its future? The early classics in the genre perfectly explored Mih\u00e1ly Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi\u2019s concept of the flow state, through minimal controls, hyper-accelerated movement, intense enemy threat and environment that invited smooth, seamless exploration. It could be argued that almost every addition after this \u2013 customisation, killstreaks, cover mechanics, etc \u2013 have served to throttle back on this sense of freedom and fluidity. Modern Warfare perhaps got the balance exactly right \u2013 offering 60 frames-per-second gun fights in super enclosed arenas, while laying on top the longevity conventions of the RPG genre. Perhaps everything after this took excited players further and further away from the spark at the centre of the shooter universe. Or perhaps it\u2019s that old story about true epoch-shattering innovation coming from comparatively small teams working on brand new projects. Far Cry, FEAR, Stalker, Bioshock, Thief \u2013 it\u2019s hard to imagine a new first-person shooter really grappling with the whole meaning of the genre in the way these games did. The \u201cwalking sim\u201d gets so much stick as a game concept, but in their use of form, space, narrative and mise-en-scene, titles like Everybody\u2019s Gone to the Rapture, Gone Home and Fragments of Him are challenging ideas of inhabitation, embodiment and interactivity in ways that mainstream FPS titles haven\u2019t really done in years. This week, EA will be revealing more about the future of the Battlefield series. Developer EA DICE has remained steadfast in its dedication to gritty, authentic, multiplayer online battle, but it too has modernised the combat as the years have gone by. Where will it go next? The team is already doing space combat with Star Wars: Battlefront, so the future seems unlikely. Can it reverse back along the timeline of warfare without become a tribute act to its own past? Doom used to be truly anarchic. It terrified politicians and right-thinking people all over the world. How do you know when something is no longer anarchic? When it is being marketed as anarchic by a major corporation. Maybe, you know, people don\u2019t want to go online and fight in the same way they once did. Maybe people are sick of the respawn treadmill, sick of voice chat insults, sick of the conflicts they see on the news being turned into a pantomime of honour \u2013 of duty. Tastes change, audiences diversify, kids grow up. Sometimes you listen to those albums you once liked, that really spoke to you, and suddenly they seem full of self-pity and crass, processed emotion. Maybe this isn\u2019t a crisis, maybe it\u2019s just maturity. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare \u2013 will the final frontier be a new lifeline?"
"7||F1 race director: safety measures must be adopted despite driver oppositionThe Formula One race director, Charlie Whiting, has insisted that the sport must adopt cockpit safety measures despite opposition from drivers, chiefly Lewis Hamilton. Addressing Hamilton\u2019s comments that danger is part of the attraction of F1, Whiting said that he believes it would be remiss of the FIA not to act when it has identified a fundamental threat to drivers\u2019 safety. \u201cThat we are aware that accidents like this can take drivers\u2019 lives and we are aware of a solution \u2013 then I think it is incumbent on us to do our best to make sure we can protect drivers more,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not think there is any doubt about that.\u201d Hamilton has acknowledged and supported the FIA\u2019s work towards safety, but has been critical of both the devices proposed for the 2017 season \u2013 the halo design and the aeroscreen \u2013 and before the Russian Grand Prix he expressed his belief that maintaining an element of jeopardy was essential. \u201cWhen I get in that car, I know that there is a danger,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a risk that I am willing to take and that every single driver that\u2019s ever got in the car has been willing to take. Everyone comes to me who\u2019s just started watching Formula One and says: \u2018It\u2019s so dangerous.\u2019 That\u2019s a large part of why they are so in awe of what you do.\u201d However, the FIA\u2019s Whiting, who has said that a decision on which device will be adopted will be made by 1 July, does not accept this as a basis for rejecting cockpit safety improvements. \u201cI take his point, but there will always be risks,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are driving a car that quickly. When you look at them on track, it\u2019s not until they go off the track that you realise how fast they are going and just what damage can be done. Cars will still look dangerous. Our job is to try and make them look dangerous without being dangerous. \u201cYou only have to have an accident to see that it is dangerous. There is nothing better than to see a driver get out of an incredibly damaged car like we saw with Fernando Alonso [in Australia]. Everyone expects it. We want to improve the chances of that happening while the spectacle is still there.\u201d The sport has made huge advances in safety since the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994, not all of them initially embraced. The Hans \u2013 head and neck support device \u2013 was not universally welcomed but it has proved extremely successful and its use is compulsory in international FIA events. That Alonso could emerge effectively unscathed after his huge accident in Melbourne also proved how effective safety rules on wheel tethers and side, frontal and inverted impacts have been. But the cockpit is still exposed and the move towards some form of head protection has been under investigation by the FIA for some time, not least since Felipe Massa suffered a skull fracture after being hit by a spring in 2009 at Hungary, the same year Henry Surtees, son of the former world-champion John, was killed at Brands Hatch during a Formula Two race having been struck by a wheel that had broken free from another car. The FIA were already testing jet fighter canopies in 2011 when Dan Wheldon died in an accident at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, after his car landed cockpit-first in the catch netting. The British driver Justin Wilson died after after he was hit by a piece of flying debris in an IndyCar race at the Pocono Raceway last year and Whiting believes the FIA simply cannot do nothing to try to reduce the threat, despite concerns from some, on the grounds of both aesthetics and that any device would make it harder for fans to see drivers. At the Russian Grand Prix, F1\u2019s chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, said he did not believe the sport needed the aeroscreen or the halo. \u201cWe are aware that driver\u2019s heads are exposed to a certain extent,\u201d Whiting pointed out. \u201cFar less than they were 20 years ago, of course. But do you ever stop with safety research? Look at road cars 20 years ago some of the things you see on road cars now you would not believe would be necessary but they are now normal. Hamilton\u2019s team-mate, Nico Rosberg, who won in Russia and is 43 points ahead of the British driver in the championship is, in contrast, firmly in favour of implementing a device. \u201cWe need it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest danger zone which remains in our sport as we have seen. There have been some fatalities. It\u2019s an area where we need to keep pushing safety.\u201d Whiting believes Rosberg reflects a relative consensus across the drivers. \u201cSome drivers have said to me this is not F1 and won\u2019t be F1 any more but then other drivers, most drivers I would say, are in favour of it, in fact very, very insistent upon it being introduced,\u201d he concluded. Having first employed the aeroscreen in practice at Sochi, Red Bull will test their design again at Spain and Monaco, with the ultimate decision in the hands of the F1 commission."
"3||Trinity Mirror shares hit three-year low ahead of AGMTrinity Mirror has seen its share price fall to its lowest level in three years as disgruntled investors prepare to grill management at the publisher\u2019s annual meeting. The Daily Mirror publisher\u2019s top brass, including chief executive, Simon Fox, and chairman, David Grigson, are to be quizzed over concerns including the prospects of new national title The New Day, the ailing newspaper ad market and the ongoing potential impact of large phone-hacking payouts. Continued tough trading conditions across the newspaper market \u2013 including steeply declining print revenue and poor growth in digital income \u2013 has weighed heavily on shareholders examining their long-term commitment to traditional media stocks. Trinity Mirror\u2019s share price fell to 111p on Wednesday, the day ahead of its AGM of shareholders in London, the lowest level since August 2013 and down more than 40% over the last year. Investors are likely to seek information about Trinity Mirror\u2019s ongoing commitment to the cut-price The New Day, which was launched in February, which sources believe could be costing the equivalent of almost \u00a31m a year. It was initially hoped that sales would top 200,000 copies a day \u2013 putting it in the same league as the last successful national title to launch, i \u2013 but instead it is understood to be selling closer to 30,000. Investors are also likely to ask about the company\u2019s financial exposure in making payouts to hacking victims. The publisher failed in legal efforts to get the \u00a31.2m amount awarded to eight victims reduced. The eight victims, including actor Sadie Frost and former footballer Paul Gascoigne, were considered a test case for the level of payout in more than 50 other claims the company is facing. After the ruling, on 23 March, Trinity Mirror issued a statement saying it would cost the company about \u00a341m to settle the hacking claims. The company has significant resources to draw upon to handle financial claims, as it makes about \u00a3100m in profits annually. \u201cNo one is really buying shares, no one,\u201d said one City source. \u201cBecause of New Day, the issue with print advertising and the phone hacking costs not being resolved [a positive business] story is not getting out there. There are three reasons not to buy [Trinity Mirror shares]. They need to be more on the front foot. They did a positive deal to buy Local World but the narrative [to investors] about that has been obscured by the performance of New Day.\u201d Trinity Mirror\u2019s share price was less than 40p when it was announced that Fox, the outgoing HMV chief, would take over from Sly Bailey as chief executive. During his tenure the company has enjoyed a peak share price over 230p, and Fox tried to drive growth by acquisition buying regional publisher Local World for \u00a3220m in October last year. Fox also held talks with Daily Express owner Richard Desmond to potentially buy \u201ccertain assets\u201d, but negotiations fell through reportedly over price and pension issues."
"3||London Evening Standard plumps for Zac Goldsmith as mayorThis may come as little surprise to those who regard the London Evening Standard as the \u201cDaily Boris\u201d, but the paper has decided his successor as the capital\u2019s mayor should be... don\u2019t hold your breath... Zac Goldsmith. A leading article, \u201cOur manifesto for the next London mayor\u201d, compares the relative merits of Tory Goldsmith and Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan. Both, evidently, \u201clack the charisma of Boris Johnson\u201d but the Standard says \u201cboth are public-spirited and intelligent individuals with sensible views on most of the big issues\u201d, which are \u201chousing, transport, crime \u2014 and clean air.\u201d The paper believes \u201cthere are significant areas of agreement between them\u201d and thinks Khan \u201chas fought the stronger and more combative campaign.\u201d But, over the past few weeks, it argues that Goldsmith \u201chas come into his own, and emerged as a candidate with interesting and thoughtful views.\u201d It continues: \u201cThis paper has done its best to be even-handed over the course of this campaign and to do justice to all the candidates. Sadiq Khan has fought ably and well. He has sought to draw a coherent distinction between himself and his party under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. He has dealt creditably with questions about his perceived association with extremists by emphasising his commitment to deal robustly with those who seek to harm us. Indeed, it is to his advantage that he is Muslim: a London Muslim mayor would signify that this is a unified and cohesive city.\u201d Even so, \u201con one key issue Zac Goldsmith has shown himself to be the stronger candidate. He has a vision of how London can grow in such a way as to be a green and beautiful city as well as a big and prosperous one.\u201d On housing, Khan accepts the need to build many more houses, especially affordable ones BUT Goldsmith has \u201cgiven thought to the question of how the housing stock is to grow in a way that will not diminish our quality of life. He has said that housing should be medium-rise rather than tall...\u201d On pollution, \u201cGoldsmith\u2019s commitment to the issue is of long standing... he promises to be London\u2019s greenest mayor, if elected.\u201d The Standard concedes that Goldsmith \u201cis not a combative politician and his wealthy background is a problem for some voters.\u201d But, says the paper which distributes 900,000 copies a day across the capital, it is Goldsmith\u2019s \u201cvision for the future of London as a safe, beautiful and harmonious city\u201d that is attractive. And it conclucdes: \u201cOf the two strong candidates, he has more compelling ideas on tackling pollution and congestion. That is why we support him. Now our readers must make up their own minds.\u201d Well, as I suggested, this desire to see a Conservative in City Hall is hardly likely to come as a shock. Just last week the Media Reform Coalition produced research showing that the Standard appeared to be acting as \u201cthe mouthpiece for the Conservative party.\u201d It found almost twice as many positive headlines about Goldsmith than for Khan, and that the Labour man was subjected to the strongest negative bias in the paper\u2019s coverage. In spite of that, the two latest opinion polls suggest that Khan is the favourite to attract most votes. So no-one can accuse the Standard\u2019s editor, Sarah Sands, of wanting to end up on the winning side."
"2||BAE chairman to peace activists: 'weapons sales encourage peace'The chairman of BAE Systems has claimed his company\u2019s weapons sales encourage peace, as he responded to questions from peace activists who infiltrated the arms maker\u2019s shareholder meeting. Sir Roger Carr was forced on the defensive by a salvo of questions probing BAE\u2019s dealings with Saudi Arabia, which is currently at war in Yemen. According to a UN panel, Saudi forces have conducted \u201cwidespread and systematic\u201d attacks on civilian targets. In response to one such question, Carr said: \u201cWe are not here to judge the way that other governments work, we are here to do a job under the rules and regulations we are given.\u201d He insisted that Saudi Arabia, as a crucial ally to Britain, was an entirely appropriate customer for BAE\u2019s weapons and services. All sales by BAE were in accordance with rules and regulations set out by the UK government, he repeatedly said. \u201cWe will stop doing it when they tell us to stop doing it,\u201d Carr added. Peace activists dominated the meeting, repeatedly asking the BAE board to give their moral justification for supplying weapons to countries accused of human rights abuses. Others urged the board to switch their business to finding solutions to climate change, water shortages and other environmental problems. When one questioner argued that lasting peace can only be achieved through negotiations, Carr replied: \u201cThere is, however, in the world in which we all live, the principle of speaking softly but carrying a big stick \u2013 and that very often encourages people to negotiate. \u201cWe try and provide our people, our government, our allies with the very best weapons, the very best sticks they can have, to encourage peace.\u201d At another point, Carr said his ethical justification was \u201cin our belief that what we are doing is in the interests of peace for the world, rather than simply as aggressors. We maintain peace by having the ability to make war and that has stood the test of time. \u201cWe are a defence company and I have tried to give you clearly and openly the rules under which we operate \u2013 not hide behind \u2013 and the belief that we have as individuals which allows us to do this work in a proud and positive way, rather than with a sense of shame.\u201d At the beginning of the meeting, after two activists were carried out for holding up placards, Carr acknowledged the presence of protesters. \u201cSome of you will have genuine reservations about both what we do and where we do it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs always there will be an opportunity to put questions to the board and I and my team will seek to respond clearly and courteously to any question you pose. Whilst we may not always agree, I\u2019m certain that mutual respect and good manners will always produce the most valuable exchanges.\u201d Carr only appeared to lose his temper when one shareholder said: \u201cYour defence reminds me of the IG Farben defence at the Nuremberg tribunals.\u201d It was an IG Farben subsidiary that made the Zyklon B gas used to murder Jews and others in Nazi concentration camps during the second world war. \u201cCan I just say to you, sir, how grossly offensive I find that and to every member sitting on this board,\u201d Carr replied. After more than an hour of hostile questions, Carr asked shareholders to come forward to change the subject. When one man raised the inadequacy of the venue\u2019s sound system, Carr replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry you hadn\u2019t heard the questions. Actually there were some questions I wish I hadn\u2019t heard.\u201d Towards the end, organisers resorted to switching off the microphones when people whom they identified as activists took to the lectern. About 30 activists affiliated to the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) had bought shares in BAE to gain access to the AGM. They brought placards with quotes from people enduring bombardments in Yemen, which they held up to display to other shareholders. Some dressed in black and wore red gloves and funeral-style black veils. On Tuesday another peace group, Sisters Against the Arms Trade, blockaded a missile factory owned by MBDA, in which BAE has a 37.5% stake. Fifteen women and non-binary people blocked the gates of the site in Bedford before the start of the day to stop workers from entering. MBDA produces the Brimstone missile and other precision-guided weapons, which are used by both Saudi and Emirati forces in their campaign against Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels. On the same day, a committee of MPs said it was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d that the UK government had ignored alleged breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen. \u201cThe failure by the parties to the conflict to account for their actions appears to have contributed to an \u2018anything goes\u2019 attitude by both sides,\u201d said a report by the international development select committee."
"24||Barclays 100% mortgage: how much does it really help homebuyers?The launch of the Barclays 100% mortgage brings the number of products aimed at borrowers who do not have a deposit to its highest since the financial crash. But, while would-be first-time buyers may be skimming the pages of Rightmove with new-found enthusiasm, there will be many who still can\u2019t get their hands on a loan. The new breed of 100% loans comes with strings \u2013 or rather parents \u2013 attached. Borrowers who don\u2019t have a deposit have been able to choose between a handful of other lenders for some time. Challenger bank Aldermore launched a 100% loan in 2011, and several small building societies have followed. But we are nowhere near the market seen in the runup to the credit crisis: financial information firm Moneyfacts says there are now eight 100% mortgage deals to choose from, compared with 238 in August 2007. Brokers say that the return of a mainstream lender is notable. \u201cThe small building societies and challenger banks have been quite good in offering them for certain people, but to have a big lender coming in is a game-changer,\u201d says Andrew Montlake of mortgage broker Coreco. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more first-time buyers struggling to even raise a 5% deposit without help. This will prompt them to look at whether they can get on the property ladder after all.\u201d The Barclays rate is also competitive, set at 2.99% until 30 June 2019, making it the lowest-priced 100% deal. But you will still need parents who can help ... While borrowers can now choose between eight loans from six lenders, they won\u2019t be able to do it on their own. With the exception of a 100% deal from Kent Reliance, which is aimed at people buying a shared ownership property, they all mean bringing in a family member in some form. At Barclays, families must put at least 10% of the purchase price into a Helpful Start account and keep their money there for three years. Vernon building society has a similar offer with its Family Assist mortgage, although parents need to find 20% to hold in an account and the minimum period is four years. Other lenders, which include Aldermore and Bath building society, are asking for guarantees from parents. Generally, this means some of the cost of the new property is secured on the parents\u2019 home. Although this doesn\u2019t mean the initial outlay involved in gifting a deposit, it does mean only buyers with well-off parents, who are willing to put their finances on the line, need apply. \u201cBarclays\u2019 deal is good but it still doesn\u2019t help the people who really need it: the key workers and people who don\u2019t have access to parental help,\u201d says Montlake. You need to prove you\u2019re a good risk As well as getting your parents on board, to be accepted for one of today\u2019s 100% mortgages you will need to jump through more hoops than in the runup to the financial crisis. The mortgage market review (MMR) brought in new affordability tests for borrowers, with lenders examining outgoings as well as incomes and checking that monthly repayments could be afforded even at a higher interest rate. Montlake said Barclays had a \u201cvery robust affordability calculation\u201d, so not everyone will qualify for the loan. Your guarantors\u2019 finances will also be checked more thoroughly than before the MMR. \u201cAnyone tied to the mortgage will also be vetted,\u201d says Charlotte Nelson from Moneyfacts. She adds: \u201cWhile having a guarantor has its benefits, this should not be entered into lightly as there is a lot more at stake than just the buyer\u2019s finances.\u201d You will have more choice if you have a deposit Montlake points out that rising rents in some parts of the country are making it hard for some borrowers to put anything aside towards a deposit, while Nelson says if you do have a guarantor you will generally pay a lower interest rate. But if you can raise at least 5% you will have more choice of loans and will not need a parent to back you. \u201cThe launch of the help-to-buy mortgage guarantee scheme acted as a starting gun for this sector, making it almost acceptable to lend at higher loan-to-values again, particularly to those with a 5% deposit,\u201d says Nelson. Moneyfacts says there are 250 different deals for borrowers who have 5%: a far cry from the 986 available in August 2007, but considerably more than the number of 100% mortgages. Lenders offering 100% mortgages Six lenders offer 100% loans, according to Moneyfacts. It lists these deals: Aldemore - 5.48% fixed for two years or 5.68% fixed for three years, both with \u00a3299 booking fee and \u00a3999 completion fee; guarantor needed Barclays (under Woolwich brand) - 2.99% fixed to 30 June 2019, fee-free; guarantor needed Bath building society - 3.89% fixed for three years or 3.69% discounted variable rate for three years, both with a 0.4% arrangement fee; guarantor needed Kent Reliance - 4.99% fixed for two years with \u00a3499 arrangement fee; for shared ownership properties Tipton &amp; Coseley building society - 3.19% discounted variable rate for term, fee-free; guarantor needed Vernon building society - 3.40% discounted variable rate for four years, \u00a3199 arrangement fee; guarantor needed"
"20||Memes, MP3s and the explosion of album artThe first album I properly owned was Michael Jackson\u2019s Dangerous. Given to me as a present on Christmas Day, 1991, I played the cassette constantly on a chunky Walkman and subjected my family to repeated plays on long car journeys. I was equally obsessed with the artwork; an intricately detailed, multi-layered tableau created by artist Mark Ryden over six months. It represented a massive departure from the simpler, more posed artwork of Jackson\u2019s previous albums (1987\u2019s Bad was just him, a snazzy zipped jacket and some red spray paint). The timing for such an aesthetic switch was curious: by the early 90s, music formats had shrunk from the larger canvas of vinyl to cassettes and then to CDs, so trying to spot the artwork\u2019s myriad of hidden treasures \u2013 Jackson\u2019s monkey Bubbles, the plasters he wore on his fingers, the minuscule picture of him from the 1984 Grammys \u2013 on a tiny cassette cover was like a game of Where\u2019s Wally. Its visual complexity was at odds with the way in which fans were consuming music at the time, and is a curious exception in the evolution of the album cover; which tends to mirror the changing formats and consumption methods of the time. Starting with the practicality of the 1940s sleeves \u2013 which were used to protect the record \u2013 to the punk and prog experimentalism of the 70s through to the bold graphics and controversies of the 80s and 90s and the cleaner lines of the 2000s, artwork offers a broader reflection of the cultural and technological landscape. So what can the images used by artists in 2016 reveal? If the release of Drake\u2019s new album Views is anything to go by, we are a society primed to interact with artwork in a whole new way. In today\u2019s world of online appropriation and decontextualisation (pictures of sad cats with the word Monday written on them, for example), where sites such as Reddit and Imgur are mined constantly for images that are then reappropriated, the meme is king. Last week the Canadian rapper created new Tumblr-dominating opportunities with an album sleeve that features him perched on top of Toronto\u2019s CN Tower. In the days since its unveiling the online world has responded by posting its own interpretation of his artwork, ranging from Meek Mill baiting, to big brand marketing and everything in between. Reviews of the album may have been mixed, but in terms of virality and audience reach; the imagery surrounding the record has been a resounding success. This particular example rejects the theory given by the New York Times in 2011, whose pessimistic view on the future of album artwork claimed it to be the \u201clatest industry casualty of the internet age\u201d. It argued that while the shift to CDs in the late 80s had reduced the canvas from the halcyon days of Sgt Pepper, it was at least still an important and functional element of the music industry until the arrival of the internet. \u201cThe album cover has become just a pictographic button, some little thing on a web site that you can click on to listen to or purchase some music,\u201d designer Frank Olinsky said. Rather than offer clues as to the music contained within, or defining an artist\u2019s latest era, album covers have shifted more towards instant recognition. In a digital library of millions of albums, it is important to stand out with simple, clear imagery. Certainly this shift can be seen in the artwork of the past decade of pop. Rihanna\u2019s bright red Loud album cover, for example, is a tightly cropped close-up of her face, the familiarity of which means there\u2019s no need for her name to appear. The title is written in a thin white typeface, almost entirely lost at the bottom. The deluxe version of Lady Gaga\u2019s Born This Way (ie not the ludicrous shot of her morphing into a motorbike) follows this pattern, as does Jessie J\u2019s debut album Who You Are. It\u2019s also a trick used by relatively successful album artist Adele, with 25 doing away with words and titles altogether. In these cases, the covers lose nothing when shrunken to the size of a postage stamp. Perhaps the move into a more no-frills, graphics-lead aesthetic was the cover of Lady Gaga\u2019s Judas single, which did away with the previous Nick Knight photography and facial augmentation of the Born This Way campaign. The cover \u2013 the word Judas above a cross on a black background \u2013 was apparently designed by Gaga herself using Microsoft Word. To continue the DIY look, she then took a picture of the computer screen, which showed the reflection of herself holding up her iPhone (\u201cfor texture\u201d, apparently). Suddenly the spontaneous, scrappy, fan art that would fill up Google image searches was overlapping with the official artwork, blurring the lines between the two. Drake\u2019s ability to harness the engagement of his fans remains the most powerful of all of modern mainstream artists. During the campaign for his 2015 mixtape If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late, fan art clogged up a large portion of the internet. Its straightforward design works blown up to a billboard poster, reduced to a Spotify icon or worn on a T-shirt. The fact that it\u2019s easy to manipulate and is then instantly shareable also creates some free marketing. The seeming spontaneity of which has been hijacked by labels looking to engage a fanbase: Taylor Swift created an album art generator for her 1989 album, and new artist Shura is doing the same around her current single Touch. A similar design simplicity was also used by Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 another meme-friendly artist \u2013 whose self-titled 2013 album featured a black background with her name in pink lettering. Both design aspects became a visual shorthand for the album even when put into different contexts, with the colour scheme also used for merchandise \u2013 so you could walk around wearing a black sweatshirt with the word Surfboard written in pink and people would get the reference. There have been casualties in this new wave of uncontrolled manipulation. Not least Madonna, whose Rebel Heart artwork \u2013 her face covered in black wire \u2013 was used to mock her after she inadvertently created her own meme by pasting the wire over the faces of historical figures. What this does show at least is that album artwork can still be used as a type of visual shorthand \u2013 that enough people care and understand the visual references to create viral content and keep it part of a broader discussion. Far from falling away, album artwork is starting to exist as part of a new conversation. Plus with the rise in sales of vinyl (sales reached almost 12m in the US last year compared with less than a million in 2007), and more acts releasing their albums on that format, perhaps there\u2019s yet another shift to come, offering more scope for experimentation. Take, for example, David Bowie\u2019s all-black Blackstar gatefold vinyl, which, according to some reports, merges into a starfield when exposed to sunlight. Or perhaps Welsh artist Marina &amp; The Diamonds, who revealed her scratch and sniff artwork for recent album Froot. Let\u2019s just hope Fat White Family don\u2019t try the same."
"6||If The Borrowers are 'unviable', what about other children's classics?Diving intrepidly into the Journal of Interdisciplinary Science Topics, the Telegraph has unearthed a troubling new paper for all fans of Mary Norton. According to Jonathan G Panuelos and Laura H Green\u2019s What Would the World Be Like to a Borrower?, it seems Arrietty, Pod and Homily would have rather a tough time of it. Being 16 times smaller than an average human, they would \u201close heat much faster than humans do\u201d, they\u2019d have terrible hearing, their speaking voices would be \u201cmuch higher than any human speaking naturally\u201d so they\u2019d be unable to talk to humans. And with scaled-down eyes, they would be \u201cnearly blind, as very little light would enter [their] eyes\u201d, according to the paper. \u201cBorrowers, as depicted in the film, could not exist, as a variety of both physical and biological factors make such a creature \u2026 unviable. Any human isometrically scaled down 16-fold would experience a variety of problems, having reduced hearing and vision, extremely high voice pitch, and be unable to maintain normal body temperatures,\u201d write the authors. Shockingly, then, it seems that the Clock family and their adventures in The Borrowers and its sequels were nothing more than a figment of Norton\u2019s imagination. A figment that won her the Carnegie medal, no less, but still \u2013 she was making things up. What does this mean for other classics from my childhood, I wonder? Is there going to be research showing that spirits couldn\u2019t really have existed in Lucy M Boston\u2019s Green Knowe? Might Will Stanton\u2019s magical powers as an Old One in Susan Cooper\u2019s The Dark is Rising sequence actually be scientifically impossible? Could a Psammead really grant wishes? Clearly this is an area in which much, much more research is needed. I\u2019m happy to volunteer, of course, but the thing that\u2019s really worrying me is that I\u2019m due to be spending five hours in the car with the family this afternoon and have downloaded an audiobook of The Borrowers to see us through. Here\u2019s hoping I don\u2019t get a lecture on the relationship between surface area and heat loss from the back seat \u2026"
"0||One in six cleaners, childcare helpers in California paid below minimum wageOne in six employers of domestic workers fails to pay the minimum wage in California, according to unprecedented research on workers who are often left behind when cities and states reform labor laws and raise wages. In the first study of its kind on an industry that typically avoids scrutiny, researchers with the University of California Los Angeles Labor Center found that out of two million domestic employers in the state \u2013 those who hire people for house cleaning, home care support and childcare \u2013 roughly 17% violate the minimum wage law. That means as many as 340,000 workers could be making below minimum wage, according to the report published on Wednesday, which was shared exclusively with the Guardian and marks the first comprehensive survey of domestic work employers in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry and a workforce that was historically left out of labor protections and labor policy,\u201d said Saba Waheed, research director of the UCLA Labor Center and co-author of the study. \u201cSocially and culturally, it\u2019s a type of work that isn\u2019t always valued.\u201d Although previous research has analyzed the experiences of domestic workers, the report \u2013 titled Profile, Practices, and Needs of California\u2019s Domestic Work Employers \u2013 is the first large-scale survey of the people who hire these workers, with findings based on responses from a randomly selected pool of 501 people. The report, which found that 16% of all households in California hire domestic workers in their homes, comes as cities and states across the country are moving to increase their minimum wages and provide mandatory sick days and parental leave. With California and New York passing legislation to gradually raise their statewide minimum wages to $15 an hour and Oregon passing a similar measure, advocates say it is crucial that workers in industries that operate underground and frequently violate labor protections are not excluded from the new benefits. The surveys, conducted from October 2015 to January 2016, found that 17% of domestic employers in California paid below the minimum wage, which was $9 per hour in 2015 and increased to $10 per hour this year. Five percent paid rates matching the minimum wage and 17% paid \u201clow wages\u201d of $9.01 to $13.83 an hour. Out of an estimated 380,000 childcare employers, 42% were paying below minimum wage, according to the report. Additionally, although a small percentage of employers said they had domestic employees work overtime, almost none of them properly paid them for those hours. Unlike some companies that willfully exploit vulnerable low-wage workers, the minimum wage violations in domestic work are largely tied to the informal nature of the industry and the fact that, as the study found, a majority of employers pay some kind of flat rate instead of hourly wages, according to Waheed. \u201cIt\u2019s a symptom of the lack of structures in the industry,\u201d she said. \u201cEmployers may not even know they\u2019re not paying the minimum wage \u2026 You have to think about your home as a workplace.\u201d The report more broadly highlights the ways in which people across a wide range of demographics are increasingly relying on domestic work \u2013 with low-income households representing 44% of all domestic employers. Some employers are \u201cnot poor enough to get access to certain subsidies, but then are not making enough to be able to afford the home care support they need\u201d, Waheed said. While low-income employers tend to pay lower wages or below the minimum required by law, 21% of moderate- or high-income employers also pay workers low wages, according to the report. The data highlights the need for states to expand and enforce industry labor protections and develop mechanisms to enforce basic labor laws for workers in homes, the report said. Although wage violations against domestic workers appear to be rampant, employees infrequently file complaints, according to data provided by Paola Laverde, spokeswoman for California\u2019s department of industrial relations. In 2015, domestic workers filed 230 wage claims across the state \u2013 a small fraction of the nearly 30,000 total claims that year, she said. \u201cMy experience in the employers I come across is that they want to be treating the workers fairly,\u201d said Lindsay Imai Hong, an organizer with Hand in Hand, a national association of domestic employers, which encourages people to sign a \u201cfair care pledge\u201d, saying they will pay cleaners and other home workers fair wages and offer paid time off. \u201cFor some, it really is an education issue,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of families don\u2019t have the resources either of time or of information to go about learning how to become a fair employer in their home.\u201d The report also calls for stronger public investments in childcare and home-care programs and policies \u2013 so that low-income families can access the domestic support they need and employees can have better working conditions. Jessica Lehman, executive director of not-for-profit organization Senior and Disability Action, has used a wheelchair all her life and started hiring home attendants when she was 18 years old. \u201cAt 18, what did I know about hiring people? At any age, most people don\u2019t think of themselves as a boss and as a supervisor,\u201d said Lehman, a member of the research team behind the report. When employees receive fair wages and have proper working conditions, it can lead to long-term sustainable relationships with employers, Lehman added. \u201cIt really hurts everyone if we\u2019re not thinking of it as a real job. When you devalue the work, we\u2019re devaluing ourselves as seniors, people with disabilities, as parents, as people who really depend on workers.\u201d"
"3||BBC News launches \u00a31m drive to recruit disabled journalistsBBC News plans to earmark \u00a31m a year to recruit disabled journalists as part of a plan to improve the diversity of its workforce. In a meeting with staff on Wednesday, BBC head of news, James Harding, outlined plans to appoint more women, people with disabilities and those from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds into senior jobs. His remarks come a week after the BBC as a whole pledged that half its 21,000-strong workforce and leadership would be female by 2020, 15% BAME and 8% disabled. The BBC has so far struggled to reach targets on diversity set in 2014 by direct general Tony Hall. The Labour MP and former culture minister David Lammy accused the corporation of moving too slowly, saying \u201crhetoric has not been matched by real progress\u201d. In a speech to staff, Harding said: \u201cThe leadership and management of BBC News needs more women and more black people, more Asian and ethnic minority people, more people with disabilities, more people from a wider variety of social backgrounds and more young people. In the last couple of years, we have made a noticeable difference to what the BBC looks and sounds like on air. I\u2019d say it\u2019s not enough, but we have done a lot. I won\u2019t rattle off a list of names, but take a look or a listen to the news and you\u2019ll see.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have got to provide more jobs and more senior ones for disabled journalists.\u201d Harding\u2019s division has been criticised this week for appointing an outsider, Dominic O\u2019Connell as business presenter on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. The proposals to recruit more disabled journalists across BBC News have been submitted for approval to the BBC\u2019s executive board. Harding, appointed in August 2013, also announced the formation of a new \u201cunder-30s panel\u201d to work with his senior management board \u201cto ensure younger voices are not just heard but are helping to shape our future\u201d. The new panel, made up of representatives from each department, is to start in September. The plans to improve diversity come ahead of a government white paper to renew the BBC\u2019s royal charter expected to discuss diversity is expected to be published as early as next week."
"2||Next's view of consumer demand: dunno, guvHere is Next\u2019s considered opinion on the current state of consumer demand, derived from a detailed analysis of its own trading in the past six weeks: \u201cDunno, guv, we only sell clothes and stuff.\u201d The chief executive, Lord Wolfson, didn\u2019t put it like that, of course. Instead there was a worthy discourse on the effect of weather (cold in March and April versus last year\u2019s hot Easter) on recent weeks\u2019 weak sales followed by a confession that the real problem may just be that consumers are spending less. Amid the uncertainty, Next reckons its sales this year could fall by 3.5% but might rise by the same percentage. Put another way, pre-tax profits could decrease 8.9% to \u00a3748m or could improve 3.7% to \u00a3852m. The odd part is the market regarded this finger-in-the-air exercise as mildly reassuring \u2013 Next\u2019s shares rose 5%. In a sense, though, it is. Widening the range of possible profit outcomes from \u00a374m in March to \u00a3104m is unusual, but the key conclusion is surely that Next doesn\u2019t expect to come apart at the seams, whatever happens. The low-end profit figure of \u00a3748m is hardly a disaster. Not all retailers could confidently claim to be so resilient, especially if it\u2019s true that consumer confidence has turned down. In the long term, Next faces the problem of combating competitors who seem to have learned and copied all its best online distribution and logistics tricks. An upgrade is required for the online and catalogue Directory business, as Next admits. The short-term headaches, though, seem more irritating than painful."
"18||PM challenges Jeremy Corbyn over links to antisemitic extremistsDavid Cameron has used prime minister\u2019s questions to relentlessly challenge the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, over his links to extremist groups with antisemitic views. The prime minister turned the weekly session on its head as he ignored Corbyn\u2019s questions about domestic policy and instead demanded four times that he withdraw remarks relating to Hamas and Hezbollah. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he is going to have to do this one more time,\u201d Cameron said, in front of cheering Conservative MPs, who will hope the attack can maximise the party\u2019s chances in tomorrow\u2019s elections. \u201cHe referred to Hamas and Hezbollah as his friends \u2013 are they your friends or not? \u201cBecause those organisations in their constitutions believe in persecuting and killing Jews, they are antisemitic organisations, they are racist organisations, he must stand up and say they are not his friends.\u201d Corbyn repeatedly responded by saying Labour was an anti-racist party that would not tolerate antisemitism, but failed to directly withdraw his previous comments about Hamas and Hezbollah. Instead, he said that he did not approve of either organisation, adding: \u201cAnyone who commits racist acts or is antisemitic is not a friend of mine.\u201d On the eve of the mayoralty elections in London, Cameron also laid into the Labour candidate, Sadiq Khan, who he accused of a \u201cpattern of behaviour\u201d in sharing platforms with individuals with extremist views. \u201cHe shared a platform with Sajil Shahid, the man who trained the ringleader of the 7/7 attacks and accused the US of bringing 9/11 on themselves. He shared a platform with an extremist who called for Jews to be drowned in the ocean.\u201d Shahid has reportedly called for violence against British troops and run a training camp in Pakistan where known terrorists learned how to make bombs and fire rocket-propelled grenades. One of his \u201cgraduates\u201d was said to be Mohammad Sidique Khan, who led the gang of four suicide bombers on the deadliest terrorist attack ever committed in Britain on 7 July 2005. Corbyn hit back, accusing Cameron of smearing Khan, and pointing out that Sulaiman Ghani, who the prime minister previously highlighted as an extremist with links to the Labour mayoral hopeful, had also been pictured with the Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith. Cameron said Khan had appeared with Ghani nine times, and said he was a man who described women as subservient to men and who expressed unsavoury views about gay people. Cameron\u2019s attack came after Corbyn became engulfed in an antisemitism crisis after his close political ally, Ken Livingstone, made controversial remarks about Hitler and Israel that resulted in him being suspended from the party. The Labour leader, who was accused of failing to act quickly enough in suspending his friend, set up an inquiry into antisemitism led by the former Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti."
"20||Cult heroes \u2013 Hank Williams Jr: crusading country boy with a lesson for the leftIn music, rebels and iconoclasts come in many shapes and sizes. And while there may be a perceived correlation between artistic integrity and liberal politics, out in the real world ideology and orientation is of far less importance than direction of travel, and the determination of someone to get to where they\u2019re headed. Just take the case of Randall Williams. He was barely old enough to walk when his father, Hiram \u201cHank\u201d Williams, died in the back seat of a car while being ferried between gigs. Hank Sr hadn\u2019t just been a country star he had minted a string of stereotypes that helped shape our view of the role of the artist in the 20th century. He was among the first musicians to become as famous for the songs he wrote as for the ones he sang written by others, and when those songs spoke of folks looking bleakly across blasted lives and pondering their narrow range of bad options (Hank Sr\u2019s final release before his death was I\u2019ll Never Get Out of this World Alive) he helped popularise the notion that an artist may be doomed by precognition of their tragic fates, a notion promoted by his self-medicating a spinal problem with drink and drugs. That he\u2019d achieved popularity in spite of, rather than with help from, the country music establishment only seemed to endear him to the people he wrote for and about: men, women and children doing their best to pull themselves up by the bootstraps in an America busy building a new age. For Hank\u2019s son, then, the die had long since been cast. With the country world in extended mourning for the father he\u2019d barely got to know, he was pushed, more or less as soon as he could stand on stage and hold a tune, into playing shows in character as his late dad. Young Randall had ready access to some seriously inspiring figures: among the visitors who\u2019d drop in on him and his manager mother at the big house on Franklin Road, Nashville were artists who\u2019d had hits with his dad\u2019s songs \u2013 Ray Charles, Perry Como, Tony Bennett, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis. Johnny Cash gave the youngster a lifelong fascination with American history: the pair would wander the property, digging up bullet casings and other items left behind during the civil war. By the time Hank Jr reached adulthood, he\u2019d been given a thorough grounding in both making music and doing it his own way. It still took him a while to find his groove, and getting there nearly destroyed him. After a string of releases on which he essentially impersonated his father, he became frustrated with the leash his mother placed on his career, and eventually split from her management and moved out of Nashville. Substance abuse led to a suicide attempt in 1974, but the music helped bring him round. He recorded an album \u2013 Hank Williams Jr and Friends \u2013 with members of southern rock bands. Between the end of the sessions in July 1975 and the album\u2019s release in December, Williams went climbing in Montana. On his descent from the summit of Ajax Peak, he slipped through snow and fell almost 500 feet. He needed multiple reconstructive operations for injuries likened to having his face smashed with an axe. His recuperation lasted a full two years, and when he eventually re-emerged, it was behind a mask of dark glasses, beard and Stetson hat \u2013 and with an intensified determination to plough his own musical furrow. Fusing all the elements of his life story and its complicated context, a singular strain of driving, rock-country songs about heavy drinking, one-night stands, life on the road and the pressures of being the son of an icon became his stock in trade. In songs like Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound and the anthem Family Tradition he didn\u2019t just admit to his ancestry \u2013 the good and the bad; the iconic music and fame\u2019s legacy of introspection and abuse \u2013 he embraced and embellished it. Crucially, rather than deal in metaphors about his life, he wrote about it in direct and frank terms: All in Alabama found him discussing his near-death experience up on Ajax in the kind of self-mythologising tone that Tupac Shakur would adopt more than a decade later. Part of Hank Jr\u2019s shtick was to offer identification with the everyday travails of those who made up the bulk of his audience: rural and suburban strivers, the hard-working, low- and medium-income blue-collar folk who were finding themselves increasingly marginalised as Reaganomics bit deep. Identifying himself with the downtrodden and against corporations and vested interests came naturally to someone who\u2019d spent years trying to take charge of his own destiny, and it powered what remains his greatest moment on record. A Country Boy Can Survive, released in 1981, posits pride, resilience and individuality as the innate character traits that will help the rural poor overcome threats from environmental calamity, urbanisation and big business. In setting the scene \u2013 with its portentous music as much as its emphatic lyrics \u2013 as an apocalyptic conflict between tradition and modernity, Williams really caught the mood. He\u2019d never write anything as subtly political again. Instead, Williams\u2019 agit-prop would be drawn thereafter in garish, cartoon-like lines. As his river of massive 1980s hits dried up \u2013 throughout the 1990s and 2000s his profile in American pop culture relied on the use of a remade version of the 1984 hit All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight as the theme to Monday night NFL coverage \u2013 his public profile became as much about his political beliefs as his music. He reworked earlier songs for the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2000, and McCain-Palin in 2008. By 2011, disenchanted with the entire Republican field, he managed to elicit shock even from Fox News presenters when he essayed a gauche comparison between Barack Obama and Hitler. ESPN yanked All My Rowdy Friends from the following week\u2019s football coverage, with broadcaster and singer trading \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d and \u201cI quit\u201d statements over the following days. Williams turned the episode into fuel for several songs on his 2012 album Old School New Rules, including the bellicose The Cow Turd Blues, on which self-justification sloshes over the levee into self-indulgence, and the Hank Sr-sampling Takin\u2019 Back the Country. The belligerent mood carried over into We Don\u2019t Apologize for America, a track that completed the cycle of influence Williams\u2019s 1980s tracks had had on a wave of conservative country stars who emerged at the start of the 21st century: the song features Merle Haggard inserting one of his own lines (\u201cIf you\u2019re runnin\u2019 down our country, hoss, you\u2019re walkin\u2019 on the fightin\u2019 side of me\u201d) into a lyric that takes Williams\u2019s rightwing persona for a walk beyond the edge of parody. (There\u2019s few places left to go after a couplet like \u201cIt ain\u2019t the protesters or politicians / It\u2019s the 19-year-olds on dangerous missions\u201d.) The irony is that the entire point of Williams\u2019s Obama/Hitler analogy was undermined by his own response to it, and by the identity of some of the people who stood up for him when that cow turd hit the fan. He told Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity that seeing Obama and Joe Biden playing golf with John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, had sent the wrong message to Republican voters \u2013 not because it implied political leaders were swanning about playing games, oblivious to the concerns of ordinary people, but because the two sides were mortal enemies who had long ago passed the point where reconciliation or mutual compromise was possible. Yet Williams himself had been among those arguing for an end to partisan bickering not too many years earlier. In typical fashion, he reckoned most of the world\u2019s flashpoints and trouble-spots could be calmed down if everyone could be persuaded to share a beer with their antagonists \u2013 and the response to #Hitlergate would prove that some of Williams\u2019s staunchest supporters were people who did not share his political views. Brad Paisley didn\u2019t just support Obama, but performed a song inspired by his election in front of the president at the White House. It was Paisley \u2013 and another left-leaning country star, Carrie Underwood \u2013 who led the Hank Jr rehabilitation when hosting the Country Music Association awards in 2011; the pair sent up the incident by gently admonishing Hank in a rewritten version of Family Tradition before Williams joined them on stage. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to read parts of Hank Jr\u2019s career as anything other than an endorsement of bilateral thinking \u2013 as proof that musicians can teach the establishment a thing or two by putting the greater good of shared creativity ahead of other more transient, personal or partisan concerns. He\u2019s recorded songs by Kris Kristofferson, and turned up in March to perform at an event to honour him in Nashville, despite Kristofferson being a well-known leftie who wrote and recorded songs praising Nelson Mandela and the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Williams has also worked with Democrat supporters such as Willie Nelson, gave a guest spot on an album to Steve Earle when the self-described socialist was still struggling to establish himself as a solo artist in the mid-1980s, and counts Waylon Jennings as a key mentor regardless of the fact that the late country legend apparently felt equally unhappy with both of America\u2019s mainstream political parties. But appreciating such fine gradations in shades of grey, especially when considering an artist whose work appears to rely on extremely high contrasts, isn\u2019t something our media-saturated selves seem particularly well equipped for. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing in the discussion in our popular culture in America is seeing the people behind things,\u201d Paisley told me in 2013. \u201cHank is one of my favourite people in this town [Nashville]. He\u2019s one of my favourite musicians to be with. He\u2019s a huge influence on me musically, and he\u2019s a friend now. One of my greatest moments ever, career-wise, was giving him the opportunity to walk out and make fun of it on the [2011 CMA Awards] show \u2013 and showing more of who he is that moment, the guy I know, than anything any media outlet could have covered.\u201d Politics has taken a back seat for Williams this time around, even though his new LP, It\u2019s About Time, has again arrived in a presidential election year. His Twitter feed is notable for its lack of electioneering, and in February he told Rolling Stone: \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about the election.\u201d The record isn\u2019t devoid of politics, but its most outspoken moment is relatively nuanced (if perhaps only by his own standards): a cover of God &amp; Guns, a song first recorded in 2009 by Lynyrd Skynyrd. It\u2019s blunt and angry, railing against an unnamed politician whose policies, it says, will lead to Americans having to forego religious freedom and the right to bear arms. Yet in its unspecific bluster there\u2019s the echo of that acknowledged stumble on the 2008 campaign trail when Obama despaired of working-class Americans who \u201ccling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren\u2019t like them\u201d. The challenge Williams\u2019s music presents for the left isn\u2019t quite the one it might look like. It would be both easy and tempting to listen to a few of his more galumphing political songs and see a rightwing blowhard whose work can be either derided or ignored; but that would be to accept deepening partisan entrenchment as the only possible outcome. Instead, and despite all appearances to the contrary, the lesson of Williams\u2019 misadventures in mainstream politics is surely that art \u2013 and political dialogue \u2013 should be about inclusion rather than polarisation; that apparently incorrigible fanatics can help broaden understanding even when they seem to prefer stubborn and studied intransigence. And perhaps that good friends, like those angels in the midst of a orbital disaster he sang about, are all the more precious when they\u2019re hard to find."
"1||Woman who defied 300 neo-Nazis at Swedish rally speaks of angerThe lone protest of a woman defying a march of 300 uniformed neo-Nazis is set to become an iconic image of resistance to the rise of the far-right in Scandinavia. A photograph of Tess Asplund, 42, with fist raised against the leadership of the Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM) in Borl\u00e4nge, central Sweden, on Sunday has gone viral in the country. \u201cIt was an impulse. I was so angry, I just went out into the street,\u201d Asplund told the Guardian. \u201cI was thinking: hell no, they can\u2019t march here! I had this adrenaline. No Nazi is going to march here, it\u2019s not okay.\u201d After joining a large counter-demonstration she took the train back to Stockholm and did not think about what happened until Monday evening, when the photograph spread on social media. \u201cNow it\u2019s a circus. I am in shock,\u201d said Asplund, who is 5ft 3in and weighs just 50kg (eight stone). \u201cThe Nazis are very angry, so I am a little \u2018Oh shit, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have done that, I want peace and quiet.\u2019 These guys are big and crazy. It\u2019s a mixed feeling, but I am trying to stay calm.\u201d Asplund\u2019s lone protest comes at a time when the far-right in Sweden is increasing its activities, according to Daniel Poohl of Expo, the anti-racist foundation in Stockholm, whose photographer David Lagerl\u00f6f captured the image. The anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats party polls between 15% and 20% and holds the balance of power in parliament, while racist sentiments are fuelled by a fragmented landscape of internet hate sites. The avowedly antisemitic National Socialists of the NRM are the extreme wing of this spectrum, Poohl says. \u201cWe live in a Europe where far-right ideas are becoming more popular, and there is also a reaction against them. It is a time when people are longing for something to channel their urge to resist the Europe that builds borders against refugees, the Europe that cannot cooperate any more. Tess has captured one of the conflicts of our time,\u201d he said. Swedish media have compared the photograph to a famous image from 1985 known as tanten med v\u00e4skan, \u201cthe lady with the bag\u201d. The image, taken by Hans Runesson, shows a woman hitting a skinhead from the Nordic Reich party with her bag. The picture of Asplund is in many senses more powerful in the Swedish context today, Poohl says. \u201cWe now live in a multicultural society, so it makes sense that it was a black woman.\u201d Swedish civil society is working hard to settle tens of thousands of refugees from the Middle East and Asia who sought asylum in the country last year, but there has been a spate of arson attacks on refugee accommodation, and the government has toughened up its asylum policies. The NRM is known for targeting anti-racists, says Asplund. \u201cI have friends who have been attacked by them and who have had to change their address. I have had calls at night from private numbers, screaming at me. It is hard to talk about the hate,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel ashamed that we have this problem. The police say it is a democratic country, so they can demonstrate. But these are Nazis! It is horrible.\u201d Asplund, who describes herself as Afro-Swedish, is unemployed, and active in the group Afrophobia Focus. Sweden was identified by the UN last year as having a particular problem with afrophobia, defined as hostility towards people with a background from sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cRacism has been normalised in Sweden, it\u2019s become okay to say the N-word,\u201d she says, recounting how a man on the subway used the racial slur while shouting and telling her to hurry up. \u201cBut nobody paid any attention. I thought Sweden in 2016 would be more open minded, but something has happened,\u201d Asplund says. \u201cI hope something positive will come out of the picture. Maybe what I did can be a symbol that we can do something \u2013 if one person can do it, anyone can.\u201d"
"3||BBC Studios' Natalie Humphreys joins executive exodusNatalie Humphreys, the BBC executive responsible for Countryfile and The One Show , has become the latest corporation boss to leave the nascent BBC Studios project, the ninth senior departure from the BBC in recent months. Humphreys\u2019s exit, which was announced on Wednesday, comes less than a week after the departure of Mark Freeland, controller of fiction and entertainment in the BBC\u2019s production division and executive producer of James Corden\u2019s The Wrong Mans. Mark Linsey, the director of BBC Studios, is overseeing a wholesale reorganisation of the production arm, which formally came into being last week and is the first step in director general Tony Hall\u2019s efforts to open up both the corporation\u2019s in-house programme makers and the BBC schedules to more competition. Humphreys, who has been controller of factual and daytime since 2013, headed up the non-fiction areas of BBC Production, now renamed BBC Studios, including The One Show, as well as documentaries, features, factual entertainment and formats, and the natural history unit responsible for many David Attenborough hits. Humphreys said her department had made \u201cgreat strides\u201d to make the BBC\u2019s production department more competitive and said she left the factual production network in a \u201cmore coherent, diverse and creative place\u201d. She said her time at the BBC had been \u201cpacked full of highs. It would be hard to beat the feeling in that [outside broadcast] truck when the blue whale turned up for us on Big Blue Live but there\u2019s just as big a buzz from Countryfile hitting 9 million viewers, Louis Theroux coming home to British soil and ... David Attenborough smashing Sunday ratings with the world\u2019s largest-known dinosaur.\u201d BBC Studios now has four vacancies: controller of factual and daytime, Freeland\u2019s head of scripted comedy and drama role, the head of natural history job vacated by Wendy Darke, and head of digital. Linsey said: \u201cNatalie is a respected creative leader whose commitment to both specialist factual and popular factual programming is clear to everyone who she has worked with. I am grateful to Natalie for the work she has done in strengthening and simplifying factual and daytime production and providing a firm platform to build further on in BBC Studios. I\u2019d like to thank her for her contribution to BBC Television and to BBC Studios and wish her well in future.\u201d Other BBC executives who have left in the last eight months include director of television, Danny Cohen, drama chief, Polly Hill, the first BBC Studios boss, Peter Salmon, controller of seasons and special projects, Janice Hadlow, BBC2 controller, Kim Shillinglaw, and creative director, Alan Yentob, although he remains as the presenter of Imagine."
"12||The Iphigenia Quartet review \u2013 picking over a Greek myth's bloody bonesWas Agamemnon a decent man in a dreadful situation when he was confronted with the choice to either sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia or face revolt from his army? Or was it his failings as a man and husband that set the catastrophic events in train? Who was the real Clytemnestra behind the myth of the woman who slaughtered her war hero husband in the bath? Could a girl be transformed into a deer at the moment that the sacrificial blade cuts her throat \u2013 or was it just a story told to serve a political purpose? Mythmaking and storytelling are untangled and rewoven in these four 40-minute plays that don\u2019t just respond to Euripides\u2019 Iphigenia in Aulis but explore how the stories have seeped into our consciousness and are constantly being remade. Like Roland Schimmelpfennig\u2019s Idomeneus, staged at the Gate in 2014, The Iphigenia Quartet plays with narrative possibilities and how a story\u2019s telling can alter its meaning. The two most interesting plays \u2013 Lulu Raczka\u2019s Clytemnestra and Chris Thorpe\u2019s Chorus \u2013 take the greatest liberties with form and are all the better for it. Sadly, because the quartet\u2019s plays are being staged in pairs on alternating nights and not all together, as they were on press night, you can\u2019t actually see these two plays back to back. The ancient and the modern rub up against each other like tindersticks and spark into life in Raczka\u2019s piece, directed by Jennifer Tang, in which words and thoughts have a skittering, provisional quality. The characters \u2013 a Hollywood director pitching a movie, a female classics professor, a Greek soldier and the maid who found Agamemnon\u2019s corpse \u2013 provide a growing body of evidence, the accumulation of which only magnifies the tantalising absence of Clytemnestra herself. She is paired with Caroline Bird\u2019s Agamemnon, a more conventional study of male leadership in crisis and women in extremis, which pitches personal sacrifice against public duty, asks what it really means to be a hero and considers the price that women pay when men allow their egos free rein. Both the writing and the acting tend towards the over-emphatic. The design \u2013 an octagonal platform \u2013 adds a claustrophobic quality to these tales but limits the spatial variety of the stagings. Nonetheless, there\u2019s a blistering moment towards the end of Suhayla El-Bushra\u2019s Iphigenia, deftly directed by Rebecca Hill, when Agamemnon, seeing an opportunity to make political capital out of his daughter\u2019s sacrifice, has his words blown apart by a gory vision. El-Bushra\u2019s premise \u2013 in which a confused teenager chooses death over life \u2013 is an interesting one, but is not given the room to be fully explored here. Chris Thorpe\u2019s Chorus is not imaginatively staged but is a fascinating leap of the imagination, a series of ancient fragments that come together like an online soap opera. It\u2019s like watching vultures circling the corpse of a story and pecking away with relish. At the Gate, London, until 21 May. Box office: 020-7229 0706."
"12||Leaf by Niggle review \u2013\u00a0Tolkien's lord of small things gets a one-man showAt the start of his enchanting one-man show, actor Richard Medrington recommends we think of Leaf by Niggle as \u201cless like a parable and more like a painting\u201d. That being the case, perhaps we shouldn\u2019t dwell on how much JRR Tolkien\u2019s fairy story, published in 1945, feels like a Christian redemption allegory. We should maybe call it coincidence that, at the end of his productive life, the \u201clittle man called Niggle\u201d finds himself in a Kafkaesque purgatory of endless menial labour before escaping to an elysian idyll, as if he were en route to heaven. And maybe it\u2019s not relevant to note that, having acquired some self-knowledge, Niggle departs in the company of a shepherd who has offered to guide him on his final journey. But, striking though the religious parallels may be, Medrington has a point. That\u2019s because Tolkien\u2019s tale is not so easy to pin down. Like a painting, it reveals itself differently according to how you look at it. You may just as readily interpret the story as a lesson on the value of art. Niggle is, after all, an amateur painter whose pastoral landscapes go unappreciated by his practically minded neighbour, Mr Parish. The best use for all that wood and canvas, as far as Parish is concerned, is to shore up the hole in his roof. Only at the end of the story do his eyes open to the beauty of Niggle\u2019s vision. Or you could look at it autobiographically. The author dashed out Leaf by Niggle when he was supposed to be immersed in Middle Earth. The gargantuan task of writing The Lord of the Rings must have seemed very like Niggle\u2019s attempt to scale up his painting from the smallest leaf to a panoramic landscape. Surely Niggle\u2019s obsession, frustration and sense of futility were Tolkien\u2019s own. Yes to all of the above \u2013 and then some. As Medrington suggests in his preamble, the possible meanings \u201cdouble, treble and quadruple\u201d before your eyes. That\u2019s a phrase he borrows from Tolkien, one of a string of details he slips in at the start, seemingly in passing, to which he returns during the story proper. Medrington greets us in apologetic mood. His company is called Puppet State, but the show will feature no puppets. And the story is by Tolkien, but it will feature no wizards. Instead, Medrington goes on to draw parallels between his family\u2019s wartime service and Tolkien\u2019s experience at the battle of the Somme. What appears to be merely anecdotal is actually a way of adding mythic depth to the tale. There\u2019s a quiet satisfaction in seeing the actor repurpose his grandmother\u2019s green silk shawl as a grassy mountainside, one of several family heirlooms that appear. It\u2019s as if Tolkien\u2019s story is also his own. Under the crisp direction of Andy Cannon, Medrington tells the story with little embellishment, trusting Tolkien\u2019s words \u2013 and the unruffled clarity of his own delivery \u2013 to do the work. Enhanced by the sharply defined spaces of Gerron Stewart\u2019s lighting and the timeless folk melodies of Karine Polwart and Michael John McCarthy, it leaves you with a sense of mystery. At Howden Park Centre, Livingston, on 8 May. Box office: 01506 777666. Then touring."
