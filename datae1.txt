"0||Mr Robot star Rami Malek to play Freddie Mercury in Queen biopicRami Malek, the star of Mr Robot, is the latest actor who has signed on to play Freddie Mercury in the troubled biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. The actor \u2013 who won an Emmy for his performance as neurotic hacker Elliot Alderson in Mr Robot \u2013 will play the Queen frontman, with X-Men: Apocalypse director Bryan Singer in talks to direct. Bohemian Rhapsody has been in production for eight years, with Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor on board as music producers. Earlier this year disagreements about the direction the film should take caused Sacha Baron Cohen \u2013 who was originally cast as Mercury \u2013 to walk away from the project. Speaking to US radio host Howard Stern in March, Baron Cohen said he disagreed with May and Taylor over how much of the film should be dedicated to Mercury. The comedian and actor said: \u201cA member of the band \u2013 I won\u2019t say who \u2013 said: \u2018You know, this is such a great movie because it\u2019s got such an amazing thing that happens in the middle.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd I go: \u2018What happens in the middle of the movie?\u2019 He goes: \u2018You know, Freddie dies.\u2019 \u2026 I go: \u2018What happens in the second half of the movie?\u2019 He goes: \u2018We see how the band carries on from strength to strength.\u2019 \u201cI said: \u2018Listen, not one person is going to see a movie where the lead character dies from Aids and then you see how the band carries on.\u2019\u201d May responded by saying that Baron Cohen had acted like an \u201carse\u201d. \u201cWe had some nice times with Sacha kicking around ideas,\u201d he told the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Event magazine. \u201cBut he went off and told untruths about what happened.\u201d May had hoped Ben Whishaw, who he called a \u201creal actor\u201d, would take over the lead role of the film, which has a script from the Theory Of Everything writer Anthony McCarten. Earlier this year Malek won best lead actor in drama at the Emmys, beating the likes of Kevin Spacey (House of Cards) and Matthew Rhys (The Americans) for a win that many saw as a surprise. The film is scheduled to begin shooting early in 2017."
"0||Government pulls its funding for London concert hallPlans to build a \u201cworld-class\u201d concert hall in London have been thrown into disarray after the government pulled its funding on Friday. The project, which was proposed by the conductor Simon Rattle, was not affordable, the government said. The former chancellor George Osborne put up \u00a35.5m to produce a detailed business case for the London Concert Hall to be developed. That followed a call from Rattle, who is due to take up the role of principal conductor at the London Symphony Orchestra next year, to build a better facility in London. But Osborne\u2019s successors in the cabinet have decided that the project, also known as the Centre for Music, does not offer value for money for the taxpayer and is not affordable. It is understood that around \u00a31.25m has been spent so far, with the rest now returning to the exchequer. \u201cLondon is already home to world class culture and music venues, from the iconic Royal Albert Hall to the Barbican Hall and the Royal Festival Hall at the Southbank Centre,\u201d a government spokesman said. \u201c[It] provided funding to consider the business case for a new London concert hall to add to this mix, but has concluded that it does not currently offer value for money for taxpayers and is not affordable. Therefore it will no longer fund contributions to this project. We know this will disappoint those who are working hard to deliver this project and we wish them well with developing alternative plans for financing.\u201d Mark Boleat, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, said: \u201cThis is very disappointing news. We believe the government should have waited to see whether a business case could have been developed before making this announcement.\u201d A spokesperson for the mayor of London said: \u201cThis is bad news for London. World-class cities need world-class music venues like the Centre for Music. This looks like a vote of no confidence in London from the government.\u201d"
"1||The Spectator hands out more of its sad awards \u2013 where was mine?Monday Spare a thought for Michael Shanly, a property developer who is either Britain\u2019s most incompetent tax evader or the most unlucky. If ever a man is entitled to feel he has been picked on it is Shanly, as a report from the National Audit Office has revealed he is the only person to be prosecuted by an HMRC crack unit of accountants set up in 2009 to pursue high-net-worth individuals thought to be paying less than their fair share of tax. To be fair to HMRC, the unit has only passed two cases on to the Crown Prosecution Service so it can claim a 50 % hit rate \u2013 though some credit for Shanly\u2019s conviction must go to the French authorities who passed on a list of about 6,000 British citizens who were squirrelling money away in HSBC bank accounts in Switzerland. Tuesday The rewards for failure can some times be quite high. Most people might have assumed Will Straw would have wanted to keep a low profile after the way he snatched defeat from the jaws of victory as the mastermind of the Stronger In campaign in June\u2019s EU referendum, but instead he was rewarded with a CBE in David Cameron\u2019s resignation honours list. Straw had this to say when asked what he had done to deserve the gong by Labour\u2019s Paul Flynn: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was given the reward. I didn\u2019t ask for the award, but when I was offered it I wasn\u2019t going to turn it down, not least because I had been \u2013 as campaigners on both sides of this campaign had been \u2013 away from my family for a lot of the campaign, and I wanted to have an occasion to take my wife to the palace.\u201d As someone who was also away from home during the referendum , I\u2019m sure my gong will soon be in the post. Wednesday MPs may not be very forgiving of other people\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 scarcely a day goes by in the Commons without someone being outraged by something \u2013 but they are very indulgent towards each other. You might have thought that Michael Gove would have been sent to the backbenches indefinitely for the levels of treachery he displayed towards his friends during the EU referendum campaign, but the former justice secretary believes two months is quite enough for rehabilitation and has successfully got himself elected to the new Brexit select committee. Forgiveness can also be a two-way process: just months after Labour-MP-turned-washing-machine-salesman Keith Vaz stepped down from his position as chair of the home affairs select committee after he was alleged to have offered to stump up the cash to buy cocaine for a couple of sex workers, his comeback has begun. With the support of more than 150 Tory MPs who are keen that any future misdemeanours of theirs be treated with such quality of mercy, Vaz has been elected to the justice select committee. Pour encourager les autres. Or something. Thursday Last year the Spectator parliamentarian of the year awards were a \u2013 relatively \u2013 sober lunchtime affair at the Savoy hotel in London. This year the awards were moved to a gala evening dinner and my invitation sadly went awol. Must have been something I said last year. As you might expect, it is largely a bunfight for top Tories, though there are the few exceptions. Last year Diane Abbott collected Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s award for \u2018campaigner of the year\u2019; this year she did the same for John McDonnell. Next year she might even win the category herself for her willingness to appear any time, any place, anywhere. Boris Johnson won \u2018comeback of the year\u2019, though he rather spoiled it by declaring Brexit would be as big a success as the Titanic. I guess it all depends on whether you\u2019re one of the lucky ones in the lifeboat. The winner of the top accolade went to Theresa May, though the Speccy had been careful to relabel her category as politician of the year. Last year\u2019s winner was David Cameron. Remember him? Friday My local hospital, St George\u2019s in south-west London, is to be put in special measures after inspectors from the Care Quality Commission declared it to be unsafe and inadequately led. In its defence, I would like to claim what could be a world record for treatment at its A&amp;E department today. Having woken up at 3.30 in the morning with crippling pains in my back which felt awfully familiar to the kidney stones I had 12 years ago, I woke up my wife and got her to drive me to St George\u2019s. After no wait whatsoever, I was seen by a nurse, given pain relief and packed off to a cubicle. Within the next 90 minutes, I had had my blood taken, an ultrasound and a CAT scan performed, and by 9am I had been diagnosed with two kidney stones and sent back home with a packet of painkillers and the advice that they would either dissolve or pass within the next few days. Fingers crossed for the former. The moral of this \u2013 apart from a hospital in special measures also being a centre of excellence \u2013 is to get ill in the middle of the night. Digested week: Judges 1 \u2013 0 Brexit"
"2||With opponents inside and out, there's no plain sailing for Malcolm TurnbullI want to do something very simple this weekend to cut through the staging and the static in Canberra right now. I want to talk about what\u2019s happening rather than what people are saying. Over the next few weeks two things are likely to happen. The Turnbull government appears likely to unveil a deal that will allow some of the wretched souls detained in Nauru and Manus to finally be settled in other countries. Assuming no outbreak of extreme crazy (which is a big thing to assume in the current climate, I\u2019ll admit), it is also likely to ratify the agreement it signed up to in Paris last December, the one that produced commitments for all countries to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 1.5C to 2C. In normal political times, in that fantasy scenario where Malcolm Turnbull won the July election resoundingly, banked his personal mandate and was permitted to act more or less consistently as the politician voters have seen in the past, these things could be just transacted and presented to the public on their merits. But Turnbull has two problems. The first is that Labor is within striking distance of government. When you can feel the hot breath of your opponent on your neck, the backroom wisdom in such circumstances tends to dictate that daily politics becomes about maximising the points of difference with your opponent. We can call this survivalist mantra \u2013 pick a fight, any fight. The second problem has been on full display since the prime minister failed to win the election in the convincing way he wanted to win. Tony Abbott will play every point he thinks he can get away with, and even some he can\u2019t get away with. Even if he\u2019s a lone assassin, and right now he is, disowned by mostly everyone in the Coalition for different reasons, the voters see division and the net effect on a government is corrosive. Quite apart from the bruised feelings and antics of the prime minister in exile, the government remains divided philosophically and factionally, and the Coalition lacks Labor\u2019s institutional mechanisms to enforce internal discipline. Everything is contested. Nothing is straightforward. So instead of just producing these two developments, the third-country resettlement deal and the Paris agreement ratification, as straightforward achievements, as statements of what kind of government the Turnbull government aspires to be \u2013 a government that won\u2019t tolerate offending a basic principle of liberalism by keeping people arbitrarily detained offshore when they\u2019ve committed no crime, and a government that knows we have to deal with the existential threat of climate change \u2013 they have to be presaged by bouts of extremism. Hence the proposed bill banning asylum seekers from ever setting foot in Australia for the remainder of their days, because that will fire up the base, wrong foot your opponent and lull the Fox News Lite night shift on Sky News \u2013 just in case anyone had a transitory impulse to wonder if Peter Dutton had suddenly gone soft \u2013 which could easily trigger an outbreak of cognitive dissonance from Ray Hadley and then Dutton might have to find a Bible to swear on. Then there\u2019s all the shouting about windfarms, which makes absolutely no sense, given that Turnbull knows precisely what has to happen by way of transition to low-emission technologies and Josh Frydenberg is one of the brightest people in the parliament. Both of these characters know full well coal is on the way out, and Australia will need the much-maligned windfarms and the solar farms to decarbonise the grid in sufficient time to meet our international commitments, and to try to mitigate against the dangerous effects of climate change. Both were called out diplomatically, but comprehensively, on the political bollocks, in a speech the chief scientist made on Thursday night. Turnbull and Frydenberg, and the renewables bull horn do make a bit more sense if we tumble to the fact the government has not yet ratified the Paris deal, and doubtless wants to be able to ratify the Paris deal with only the mildest tut-tut from the Quadrant corner, rather than the whole process triggering yet another bout of internal cage fighting within the Coalition about climate change and whether it\u2019s happening or not. Frydenberg and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, are going to the planned meeting of leaders in Marrakech, Morocco, which starts this week. This pow-wow has been convened to decide the global rules towards achieving net zero emissions, which was the core of the Paris agreement. In no rational universe does the Australian government want to be in a position of going to that meeting and telling other countries we don\u2019t intend to ratify the Paris agreement, but nothing is done until it\u2019s done and the process isn\u2019t yet locked down with a cabinet ruling. Obviously, this whole play \u2013 \u201clook at those dreadful renewables and, oh look, here\u2019s the Paris agreement\u201d \u2013 is a lot more complicated than a simple game of bait and switch. But for a bit of light relief at the weekend, you could think of this as a drawing room comedy in which the lead character says, \u201cMy, aren\u2019t windfarms terrible, Rupert,\u201d while Rupert placidly signs another piece of paper guaranteeing a proliferation of windfarms into the future. Thanks, Rupert. Rupert always was a good sort. Provided Rupert is a good sort, of course. On that score, we are going to have to watch and wait."
"3||Anthony Joshua vows to humble Eric Molina in IBF title fightA knockout machine in the ring, Anthony Joshua has developed a reputation as one of boxing\u2019s more genial figures out of it. So it came as a surprise to hear the heavyweight express his desire to make the Mexican American Eric Molina \u201clook like shit\u201d when the pair square up next month. Joshua faces the 34-year-old at the Manchester Arena on 10 December in what will be the second defence of his IBF title and Friday saw the beginning of promotional duties for both fighters, which to a large extent explains Joshua\u2019s attention-grabbing remark, because this is a fight that needs a fair amount of promoting. Molina, after all, is the replacement for Wladimir Klitschko, whom Joshua was set to meet in a little over a month\u2019s time before the Ukrainian picked up a \u201cminor injury\u201d in training. Molina is a game opponent and has an interesting story but he is no Klitschko. The sense of anticlimax is tangible. Joshua admitted as much when he described himself as a \u201clittle bit\u201d disappointed not to be taking on the 40-year-old former three-belt holder next. But with the pair expected to fight next spring after the WBA finally agreed to the \u201csuper\u201d version of their world heavyweight title also being up for grabs \u2013 a major stipulation for Klitschko \u2013 the 27-year-old insists he is fully focused on Molina and putting on a show against a man who has vowed to provide the 2012 Olympic champion with the toughest fight he has been in since turning professional. \u201cThey [opposition fighters] say they\u2019re going to give me the toughest fight of my life and if that\u2019s their mentality, I\u2019ll reverse it and make them look like shit,\u201d said Joshua, who has stopped each of the 17 men he has faced since winning gold in London, including Charles Martin, who he knocked out inside two rounds to become world champion seven months ago. \u201cIf I took him [Molina] 12 rounds but played with him, that would say I have a better skill set. If I knock him out early, that says I have better punching power. As long as I win in a good fashion I can tick a good box.\u201d Joshua was in noticeably relaxed mood as he spoke and put that down to having taken the longest break of his professional career following his seventh-round stoppage of Dominic Breazeale in June. That was the joint furthest anyone had taken Joshua and by the Briton\u2019s own admission he was not at his best going into what was his first defence of the IBF title, after a disrupted training camp and glandular fever. \u201cThe break after was a godsend,\u201d he said. \u201cMe and the lads had an unbelievable holiday \u2013 to Koh Samui in Thailand \u2013 and I only started getting back into boxing when I went to Rio [Olympics] to watch the fights out there. I came back a week or so later and have been back in the gym since.\u201d Joshua admitted he was preparing for Klitschko until two weeks ago but insists switching focus to Molina has not been problematic. \u201cThese things happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI just crack on and keep the ball rolling.\u201d That is also the case for Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, who was at his hard-selling best at the press conference, hailing the quick sale of tickets for this fight (15,000 in five minutes, apparently). But there is no doubt he faces a challenge persuading the usual number of people to take up pay-per-view subscriptions now it is Molina and not Klitschko who is on the bill. The Texas-born fighter arrives in England having won 25 of his 28 professional bouts, 19 by knockout. But it says much about Molina\u2019s record that the most notable fight was a defeat to WBC champion Deontay Wilder in June last year. Molina rocked the undefeated 31-year-old with a left hook in the third round before Wilder recovered and finished off the job in trademark powerful fashion in the ninth. Molina believes that display, along with his most recent \u2013 the 10-round stoppage of two division world champion Tomasz Adamek in Poland on 2 April \u2013 shows he has the physical capabilities and mental strength to overcome Joshua, with the latter attribute backed up by the fact he has up until now combined boxing with being a full-time special-needs teacher in the Texan city of Edinburg. \u201cI\u2019ve no amateur experience but I\u2019m getting better in every fight,\u201d Molina said. \u201cI\u2019m here to make history.\u201d"
"4||Antonio Conte work ethic philosophy pays off with big productivity gainsThose Chelsea players still on extended leave in mid-July after the European Championship need only have spied snippets of Antonio Conte\u2019s inaugural press conference to discern the new head coach\u2019s mantra. He used the word \u201cwork\u201d, or one of its derivatives, 32 times in a little under an hour that day, including one response where he insisted he was \u201ca worker who likes to work\u201d. That was followed up with a rat-a-tat \u201cI only know this verb: to work, work, work\u201d, which was less a reflection on his English and more a reminder of the philosophy which would restore this club\u2019s reputation. At the time it felt like a threat to his adopted playing staff. It may actually have been a warning for the rest of the Premier League. Fast-forward through a draining pre-season littered with those dreaded triple sessions, undertaken from Cobham to the west coast of the United States, and intensive endurance work to improve fitness, or the stop-start and cluttered match scenarios throughout which Conte barks tactical instructions relentlessly from the sidelines, and Chelsea are reaping the benefits. Plenty has been made of the switch to a three-man defence at Arsenal six weeks ago, when his side trailed 3-0 and the Italian\u2019s brittle patience snapped. But, while that was a key tweak born of desperation, this team\u2019s recent progress reflects as much on the acceptance of a mindset. A playing staff that was not treated to a particularly radical summer overhaul has bought into the new man\u2019s demands. Sometimes acceptance has come grudgingly, with Diego Costa far from alone in finding the constant reminders of positional responsibilities or defensive workload rather grating. The Brazil-born striker has made his feelings rather more obvious than most with the occasional fit of pique on the turf, as demonstrated against Leicester last month. Many of these same players had grown to dread life under the intense Jos\u00e9 Mourinho regime, after all, and have not always taken easily to disciplinarian management. But nothing fuels conviction better than a run of victories. Chelsea welcome Everton on Saturday having won all four league games since that ignominy at the Emirates Stadium, and are approaching seven hours without conceding a goal in the top flight. This group of players has grown convinced that all the preparatory work that Fabio Quagliarella, a striker who played under Conte at Juventus, has described as \u201cback-breaking\u201d will get the best from them. \u201cWe thought things would be different but it was important we bought into what was happening\u201d said Gary Cahill. \u201cChange can be good. He\u2019d had success in the past and brought the ideas that he strongly believes in to our club. Early on it was difficult in terms of the fitness work. Now it\u2019s intense in the way we work in terms of tactics or analysis of games alongside that fitness work.\u201d The meticulous levels of detail to which Conte subjects his side, constantly stopping training to remind players if they have wandered even marginally out of position, might explain how this group have adopted a major change in formation apparently so seamlessly. There are no shortcuts written into his approach. Those who have been at Chelsea a while have suggested the Italian is the most demanding of all the club\u2019s recent managers, and the players must retire from Cobham with his bellowed instructions seared into their psyche. Conte chuckled when asked about the Ambrosoli al Miele throat lozenges he has been sucking through training and on the touchline to soothe a voice strained by constant shouting, before adding the key is a spoonful of honey taken just before kick-off and at half-time. \u201cMy wife tells me my voice is more attractive like this, more sensual,\u201d he said through a mock croak. \u201cBut I prefer to have my normal voice.\u201d The work ethic was always likely to be personified by N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s tireless running, but it is as much in evidence in the upturns being enjoyed by Cahill and David Luiz, or the leggy Nemanja Matic. The Serb is restored as the midfielder who rampaged over all-comers in the first half of the title-winning season. He acknowledged that \u201ceveryone feels one step ahead\u201d of where they were last year. That would apply to Costa, who has drawn the focus with his eight league goals but is deserving of more plaudits for the selfless way in which he has unsettled opposing defences. He remains one booking from a suspension, but he has been since the Arsenal game. There is even new-found self-restraint. Then there is Eden Hazard, a player who became consumed by his own inability to influence games positively last term but who has now scored in three successive matches for the first time in his career. \u201cWith only talent, it\u2019s difficult to be the best,\u201d said Conte. \u201cFootball has changed, above all in England where you play with an intensity that is supersonic, so you have to support talent with strength to cope with contact, speed and technique.\u201d The Belgian, increasingly won over to the Italian\u2019s methods as he witnesses the rewards first-hand, is finding that blend, though this is only the start. For the record, there were 26 utterances of \u201cwork\u201d or the like in a half-hour media briefing on Friday. Chelsea may have found their form but the message remains very much the same."
"4||Mauricio Pochettino haunted by Tottenham\u2019s poor end to last seasonMauricio Pochettino has said he continues to be bothered by how Tottenham Hotspur contrived to finish below Arsenal last season, as he weighed up a couple of key selection decisions for Sunday\u2019s derby at the Emirates Stadium. The Tottenham manager said Harry Kane, who has not played since the middle of September because of ankle ligament damage, will return to the squad and he gave the striker a 50-50 chance of making the starting lineup. In midfield, Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is a doubt after twisting an ankle in the 1-0 Champions League home defeat by Bayer Leverkusen at Wembley on Wednesday and if he fails to prove his fitness Pochettino will consider handing the 20-year-old Harry Winks a first start in the Premier League. Pochettino said at the beginning of the season he had been angry all summer about the way Spurs had finished the previous campaign. Their title hopes ended with the 2-2 draw at Chelsea in the third-last game but they were still three points clear of Arsenal in second place. Tottenham have not finished above Arsenal since 1994-95 and it would have meant something to break the sequence, but they lost 2-1 at home to Southampton and then, needing a point on the final day to secure a runners-up finish behind Leicester City, they were thrashed 5-1 at relegated Newcastle United. Arsenal beat Aston Villa 4-0 to leapfrog them and maintain Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s record of never finishing below Spurs. \u201cI still feel bad about last season,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt was so easy to be above Arsenal in that moment. It\u2019s true we felt very disappointed after the Chelsea game, but two games ahead and only one point to be above them [on the final day] \u2013 that was very frustrating and disappointing. It was difficult not to think about that situation. But we have another opportunity now and we will see what happens.\u201d Pochettino has won one and drawn three of his four league derbies against Arsenal \u2013 he lost to them in last season\u2019s Capital One Cup \u2013 and his mind went back to the first of them when Winks was discussed. In September 2014, after Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had been ruled out of the visit to the Emirates, Pochettino decided to start with Ryan Mason, then 23 years old. It was his debut in the Premier League and he played well in the 1-1 draw. Pochettino has never been afraid to put his trust in young players \u2013 even in high\u2011pressure games \u2013 and Winks is the one who has impressed him the most this season; more than Cameron Carter-Vickers and Josh Onomah. Pochettino was delighted with some of Winks\u2019s performances in pre-season and he has since introduced him as a late substitute in three league matches. Winks started both of the club\u2019s EFL Cup ties \u2013 the first the 5-0 home win against Gillingham and the second the 2-1 loss at Liverpool \u2013 and there was a further show of faith in him during the Leverkusen defeat. After Tottenham had conceded after 65 minutes at Wembley, Pochettino brought on Winks for Christian Eriksen as he chased the game. There is the feeling that with Tottenham at a low ebb after Leverkusen \u2013 they have not won in six games \u2013 the manager may benefit from shaking up the team. Could Winks, whom Pochettino prefers in a deeper-sitting role, be a solution in the starting XI? \u201cMaybe,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe need to assess Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, first of all, to decide but Winks is doing very well \u2013 not only against Leverkusen but Liverpool in the cup, before. \u201cFrom pre-season, you remember in Australia, he played very well against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Juventus. In that moment he started to build his future and I started to see we can trust in him. This is very good news for us.\u201d Pochettino was reminded of the parallel with Mason in the derby at the Emirates. \u201cMaybe we will repeat that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence, because there were different reasons [with Mason] but, maybe, Winks has the opportunity to play. It\u2019s one of the possibilities.\u201d Kane has long been pencilled in to make his comeback in the derby and earlier this week Pochettino suggested it was more than likely the striker would be a substitute. He has now raised the prospect of him starting \u2013 after Kane made a positive return to full training on Thursday. \u201cIt is true that on Wednesday I was positive but not very, but after Thursday I am more positive,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWill he start? It\u2019s 50-50.\u201d"
"4||The evolution of Arsenal\u2019s Mesut \u00d6zil earns comparison with BergkampBasking in the glow of the masterpiece match-winner that was the talk of Europe this week, Mesut \u00d6zil made his way serenely, contentedly, back towards London. It seemed as if half of Bulgaria wanted a bit of him before he left. He gladly had time for everyone \u2013 finessing every photo, every signature, every word of appreciation with a special touch. It was not so long ago this particular player\u2019s body language was routinely picked apart. He was too languid. Too casual. Did not want to know. Wilted under pressure. All softness without the required substance. Too many big games passed him by ... but those criticisms have faded into the shadow of an emboldened talent who is relishing the spotlight. The \u00d6zil of today carries himself differently. The composure and confidence represents how he is enjoying the feeling of being centre stage. That is what is expected of him on Sunday, in the heat of the north London derby, where the early title credentials of both teams will undergo a particularly spicy examination. Tottenham have ruffled Arsenal at the Emirates in the last couple of seasons, requiring late equalisers from the home team to save face. It promises to be as frenetic and fierce as usual, which is not the stereotypical idea of \u00d6zil\u2019s favourite environment. Yet there is more obvious determination in him to want to influence games these days. \u201cHe pushes himself much more,\u201d Ars\u00e8ne Wenger says. For a start he is much more muscular than the slender figure who arrived at Arsenal, discarded by Real Madrid, three years ago. It has been known for defenders to bounce off him this season, a far cry from the elegiac shrug he used to give when unsettled by some opposing hulk. His reinvention as a player who has added a striker\u2019s runs to his playmaking passes looks intriguingly transformative. \u00d6zil the goalscorer? Who would have thought it? Well, Wenger did. It took some time, and some encouragement but \u00d6zil\u2019s adjusted position, as a high 10 rather than a deep-lying creator, makes him an even more effective performer. \u201cI convinced him that he has it in his locker to score goals,\u201d Wenger says. \u201cHe was more focused on giving and looking. Today he understands he can have those qualities but as well be on the end of things. The timing of his runs is good. In training I noticed he is a very good finisher. When you have that in your locker you have to try to get it out. Slowly, he now realises that. Now he makes more runs to score goals. On top of that he has a fantastic attribute of a guy who is a good finisher \u2013 he is calm. You notice all the finishers are killers. That means they keep their nerve in front of goal and he has that.\u201d The old Dennis Bergkamp comparison has been aired recently. Wenger sees the similarities and is urging his current master of technique to do what it takes to earn the kind of status Bergkamp enjoyed at Arsenal. \u201cHe can be a legend if he commits,\u201d Wenger says. \u201cDennis Bergkamp committed for a long period, he played until he was 38. I wish we have 10 more years of \u00d6zil. To become a legend at the club you need to stay for a long time. If you stay two years you would not be a legend.\u201d Arsenal are doing their best on the contract front to secure an extension. \u201cWe work on it,\u201d Wenger said, accentuating the positive sign of how content \u00d6zil seems on and off the pitch. \u201cA player needs to meet his needs inside a club. It is difficult not to be happy in London and happiness that a player has when he plays comes out by his performance.\u201d It is typical of how \u00d6zil has come out of his shell that he is keen to be a face of the club more readily. In this weekend\u2019s buildup, he took part in a social media Q&amp;A session. The hashtag #AssistMeMesut invited fans who needed some help with anything to ask Arsenal\u2019s No11. Some of the requests were unsurprisingly left-field. \u00d6zil filmed answers to a handful of questions, ranging from a Turkish restaurant recommendation to relationship advice. \u201cSo my friend,\u201d \u00d6zil told @theDjole, \u201cJust be nice to her, show her your qualities and I wish you all the best.\u201d Wenger remembers the day well when \u00d6zil arrived in a flurry of deadline day activity in September 2013. \u201cIn fact on the day we signed him we played against Spurs,\u201d he says, breaking into a grin. \u201cWe won without him.\u201d It was a landmark signing for the club, at \u00a342m demolishing its transfer record. \u00d6zil has grown into life at Arsenal. Even for a player with his experience and the expectation that comes with such a high-impact signing, it was a slow burn. The efforts that have been a hallmark this season took some time to develop. Wenger acknowledges the Premier League was a bit of a culture shock for \u00d6zil. \u201cHe left some people sceptical \u2013 saying he didn\u2019t go too much into challenges or tough contact. [He punches his hand for emphasis.] He\u2019s a player who is more a guy whose strength is to get out of things but on the physical front I believe he\u2019s improved as well.\u201d For Wenger, the main difference between the \u00d6zil he signed and the one he will pick this weekend boils down to commitment. \u201cHe is 28, an age where he is more mature. The difference today is he focuses more on efficiency. When he arrived here he was more focused on playing. Today efficiency is more in his mind. Sometimes the trap for very talented players is it is easy for them. They know subconsciously they don\u2019t need to push themselves too hard to be efficient. It\u2019s so easy.\u201d The desire to push himself more is making a tangible difference to his game. \u00d6zil\u2019s increased runs, added to the indefatigable darts of Alexis S\u00e1nchez, make it that much more difficult for defenders to guard their area. Arsenal are less predictable and more punchy. Tottenham arrive at the Emirates as the league\u2019s dominant rearguard, with only five goals conceded, so Arsenal will need their front players to continue their lively form. S\u00e1nchez has scored eight, and \u00d6zil seven (Theo Walcott, who is hoping to return to fitness, also has eight and Olivier Giroud is trying to catch up), so Arsenal feel they have goals in them even against a resolute opponent. So has \u00d6zil changed enough to become the type of player determined to take a tough derby by the scruff of the neck? He excelled recently in the 3-0 defeat of Chelsea, and he will be expected to emulate that performance against Tottenham. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want,\u201d Wenger says. \u201cOf course he can be dangerous but in big games there is always a lot of expectation from him. But I believe that depends more on the team performance. If the team performance is strong then \u00d6zil will always shine.\u201d"
"4||Michael Keane and Crystal Palace pair attract Gareth Southgate\u2019s attentionGareth Southgate will assess the form of the Burnley centre-half Michael Keane, as well as the Crystal Palace wingers Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha on Saturday as he prepares to name his England squad for next Friday\u2019s World Cup qualifier against Scotland. Southgate will be at Turf Moor for the Premier League game between the sides \u2013 the only match he is to attend this weekend \u2013 before confirming his party for the game at Wembley, and the friendly against Spain four days later, on Sunday evening. The interim manager drafted Keane into his squad for last month\u2019s qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia as a replacement for the injured Glen Johnson, and the 23-year-old is expected to retain his place. The Burnley defender, who attracted interest from Leicester City over the summer and continues to be monitored by Chelsea, would serve as backup to the first-choice pairing of John Stones and Gary Cahill but could earn a first cap against Spain. One of his club-mates, the in-form goalkeeper Tom Heaton, will also be watched by Southgate, who has spoken this week to the Palace manager, Alan Pardew, over the impact being made by Townsend and Zaha. Townsend, a \u00a313m signing from Newcastle over the summer having been omitted late from Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad for Euro 2016, replaced the injured Raheem Sterling for last month\u2019s games and provided a bright cameo from the bench in the goalless draw in Ljubljana. Although that would suggest he will be retained, the 25-year-old found himself relegated to the bench by Palace against Liverpool last weekend and he is likely to start there again at Turf Moor. \u201cWe have such a close group in terms of their talent, sometimes they have to be left out for tactical reasons,\u201d said Pardew on Townsend. \u201cAndros accepted that as other players have accepted it and they will have to accept it going into this game and the next game. There has been absolutely no problem [with him]. With that England squad, there are a lot of players who are not starting for their club sides.\u201d More intriguing is Southgate\u2019s interest in Zaha, a player with whom he had an occasionally difficult relationship while overseeing the under-21s. The winger gained the second of his two caps under Roy Hodgson in 2013 but has been out of favour ever since, despite his encouraging form last term. There had been suggestions the 23-year-old might consider representing the country of his birth, Ivory Coast, having played for England only in friendlies, though Southgate has made clear Zaha features on a list of players being considered. \u201cObviously I know Gareth well, so we have had conversations about players and Wilf has come up, yes,\u201d Pardew said. \u201cI think Andros is pretty close [to the national squad], and I think Wilf Zaha is close as well. So we have two genuine chances, in my opinion, in the squad of having Crystal Palace players named. I think Zaha is playing some of his best football since he came back to the football club.\u201d Southgate watched Bournemouth\u2019s Jack Wilshere, who has completed three top-flight games in a row, at the Riverside last weekend and has been impressed by the impact made by Middlesbrough\u2019s Adam Forshaw and Ben Gibson. Danny Drinkwater, now restored to fitness, and Ross Barkley are also pushing for recalls to a squad that, barring a late flurry of injuries, is unlikely to show significant changes. The interim manager will monitor Sunday\u2019s five matches from St George\u2019s Park, including the north London derby when Harry Kane will be included in the Tottenham Hotspur squad, before naming his squad. The players will link up at the national training centre on Monday afternoon to begin preparations for Friday\u2019s qualifier against Scotland."
"4||Sunderland\u2019s recent turmoil is helping me keep job, says David MoyesOthers might regard his position as unfortunate but David Moyes believes he is a lucky man. Despite presiding over the worst start to a Premier League season, which has involved the collection of two points from 10 games, Sunderland\u2019s manager accepts that, in some ways, he is in an enviable position. \u201cI think the club are aware that they don\u2019t want to get in a situation of tossing and turning and changing managers all the time and that, at the moment, is helping me,\u201d Moyes said. Accordingly, Sunderland\u2019s seventh manager in five years continues to enjoy the staunch support of Ellis Short, the owner, and Martin Bain, the chief executive as he heads to Bournemouth on Saturday seeking that elusive first league win. \u201cStability is needed,\u201d said Sam Allardyce\u2019s successor. \u201cThe club don\u2019t want to change managers again \u2013 and rightly so. Some of my predecessors here deserved to be given longer.\u201d Short has often been prone to knee-jerk reactions but he seems determined to keep faith with his latest coach. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone to Ellis two or three times this week,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cIt was good. But I didn\u2019t expect anything else. I\u2019ve had nothing but support from him and Martin.\u201d Even so, he accepts things could alter should Sunderland keep losing \u2013 and particularly if they fail to beat Hull City at home in their first game after the international break. \u201cI\u2019m not daft, you have to win games,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a big boy and I know it\u2019s my job to get results. My job is to make sure we\u2019re in the Premier League again next season. I\u2019m not stupid \u2013 the fact of the matter is we\u2019re not doing well and it will get to a point where we can\u2019t keep saying what we\u2019re saying.\u201d The Stadium of Light hierarchy are praying it does not come to that. \u201cEllis is saying: \u2018Go on and do the job. We knew it would be a long-term job, keep going,\u2019\u201d said Moyes. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously desperate for the team to win. He wants us to buck up and do better, if we can.\u201d Moyes appreciates the disconnect at the heart of what seems an interminable cycle of disappointment on Wearside. \u201cThis is definitely still a big club,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why so many people want this job. Sunderland\u2019s still got the stature of a big British football club. It\u2019s got a fantastic stadium, it\u2019s got a really good training facility and the supporters have a pride in following their team everywhere even when they\u2019re losing.\u201d Indeed, startlingly, Sunderland\u2019s home crowds have averaged almost 42,000 this season, the sixth highest in the Premier League. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a big club and it will always be a big club,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cSunderland\u2019s size and history are not in doubt but it\u2019s the supporters who are making this club great at the moment \u2013 they\u2019re the ones keeping us going. The supporters are the only plus point. The team and the manager are not performing but the supporters are.\u201d It seems the January transfer window could prove pivotal but Moyes accepts that, without points on the board, it will become academic. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer about the January budget just yet; I hope to know more shortly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to win some games between now and January and make sure we\u2019re in a position to be in the ball game \u2013 then it could become a crucial month.\u201d"
"4||J\u00fcrgen Klopp says Ings and Man\u00e9 absence may prompt Liverpool to buyJ\u00fcrgen Klopp has said Liverpool may need a new forward in January because of Danny Ings\u2019s injury setback and Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s international commitments. The Liverpool manager is reluctant to move in the winter transfer market and, ideally, would have concluded this season\u2019s business in the summer but he has been forced into a rethink by Ings\u2019s latest knee problem. The former Burnley striker is expected to miss the rest of the campaign after undergoing surgery on Thursday on a cartilage injury suffered in the EFL Cup win over Tottenham Hotspur last week. \u201cThe surgery was very positive and the rehab has started already,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cWe will wait for him and give him all the time he needs. He will be back again and will be a Liverpool player 100%.\u201d However, with Man\u00e9 scheduled to be involved in Senegal\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations campaign in January, Klopp believes the loss of Ings could leave his squad exposed at a crucial time and in need of reinforcement. It will fall to Michael Edwards to identify potential targets and negotiate any transfers after his appointment as Liverpool\u2019s first sporting director was confirmed on Friday. The Liverpool manager admitted a replacement for Ings was needed. \u201cYes, we watch the market all the time and we need to be prepared for different situations and one of them is injuries. The Africa Cup of Nations we already knew about so we don\u2019t need to be influenced or surprised about that but it could be a moment when we approach the market. \u201cIt\u2019s not about how many strikers. Three strikers is enough, I think, but when Sadio is away we will be without a winger. We do not have many wingers, I would say. Roberto Firmino could play as a kind of a winger which would then give us just two strikers. That\u2019s how it is. But it is a long way to go until January and that month is busy. If we can go to the semi-final of League Cup [Liverpool are at home to Leeds United in the quarter-finals] it could be the busiest month of the year. We need to be prepared for this for sure.\u201d Klopp could also lose the influential defender Jo\u00ebl Matip to the Africa Cup of Nations, scheduled to be played in Gabon from 14 January to 5 February, but does not expect the Cameroon international to feature in the tournament. Matip played in the 2010 and 2014 World Cups but rejected the chance to go to the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. \u201cI would say yes,\u201d the Liverpool manager replied when asked whether he expected the defender to remain on Merseyside. \u201cBut I\u2019ve not spoken to him about this yet. I know it\u2019s a different situation to Sadio because he lived in Senegal whereas Jo\u00ebl was brought up in Germany. \u201cAs a manager you are not too happy when you don\u2019t have players in January but I\u2019m not the person to say anything about the Africa Cup of Nations. It is their big tournament and you can\u2019t say: \u2018Play it in summer.\u2019 That is quite difficult in Africa. As a manager I do not like it but it is three weeks, we knew it before, and you have to find a solution.\u201d Liverpool host Watford on Sunday looking to maintain their joint-leadership of the Premier League and extend their unbeaten run at Anfield to 19 matches. Jordan Henderson\u2019s influence on the run, believes Klopp, is finally getting the recognition it deserves, with the Liverpool captain having completed more successful passes \u2013 830 \u2013 than any other player in the Premier League. Klopp added: \u201cHow old is Hendo? Twenty-six. He\u2019s really young and yet everyone seemed to have already judged him, saying: \u2018He can do this, he\u2019s good at that but he\u2019ll never learn this.\u2019 He\u2019s 26. All these guys I have \u2013 and especially the English guys \u2013 are thinking the whole day about football and how they can improve. \u201cI like this. I like this in Jordan, he wants to work and improve, so let\u2019s use all their skills. Don\u2019t be surprised that Jordan is top of the passing. Look at the details, too \u2013 at 26 years he is a very responsible person, a very serious person and a really good skipper.\u201d"
"4||Zlatan Ibrahimovic is misfiring but attitude OK, says Jos\u00e9 MourinhoJos\u00e9 Mourinho has admitted Zlatan Ibrahimovic is \u201cmissing a lot of goals\u201d but Manchester United\u2019s manager has no problem with the striker\u2019s attitude. The Swede has scored once in his past 11 appearances and last registered in the Premier League in the 2-1 defeat by Manchester City on 10 September. In all Ibrahimovic has five goals in 15 appearances and drew his latest blank in Thursday\u2019s 2-1 defeat at Fenerbahce, after entering the fourth Europa League group game as a 29th-minute replacement for the injured Paul Pogba. Mourinho takes United to Swansea City on Sunday hoping for a first league win in two months, a dismal run of form that has dropped United to eighth place. The side have scored only 13 times in 10 league games and Mourinho pointed to this when asked if it was time to drop Ibrahimovic. Although he did not give a direct answer to the question, the 53-year-old said: \u201cHe is playing well for the team. He\u2019s creating a lot of chances and missing a lot of goals. If I remember Stoke, Liverpool, Chelsea, Burnley, he missed a lot of goals but he was fantastic in his dynamic, his working, his building up for the team, he was fantastic. \u201c[Against Fenerbahce] I cannot say the same. But in every match in the Premier League, even not scoring goals he\u2019s being fantastic. His attitude is always brilliant. He\u2019s not a guy afraid of his responsibility, so no problem at all. \u201cSometimes a team doesn\u2019t score goals because of its philosophy, because the team isn\u2019t aggressive enough and doesn\u2019t risk enough. That\u2019s not our case at all. But it\u2019s easy to see that some players lack confidence in attacking areas and they are not getting the chances they can. \u201cProbably one of the only good things [about Fenerbahce] was the fact that Rooney finally scored a goal. Maybe it\u2019s also a key point in terms of his self-confidence.\u201d That was only the captain\u2019s second of the season. Pogba\u2019s availability is in doubt because of a leg injury. \u201cThe first two fouls in the game \u2013 [Morgan] Schneiderlin and [Ander] Herrera \u2013 got two yellow cards,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cThe foul on Pogba that brought him out of the game was not a yellow card.\u201d The loss to Dick Advocaat\u2019s side was marked by a lack of direction that allowed Moussa Sow to score after 69 seconds. This followed Pedro\u2019s goal in 30 seconds in the 4-0 defeat at Chelsea last month. Mourinho believes leadership is missing. \u201cIt can happen everywhere. There are so many examples in football where people score goals in the first minutes. Nobody is free of that. But with a stronger attitude, leadership on the pitch, defenders in control of the emotion and the organisation, it\u2019s easier to be strong and be solid,\u201d he said. Put to the manager that it is unusual for one of his sides to allow such early strikes in two games, Mourinho referred to the injuries to Chris Smalling and Eric Bailly which forced him to select Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo at centre-back. \u201cYou never saw a Jos\u00e9 Mourinho team play with two left-backs as central defenders,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot be critical of the boys because they do what they can. They try their best. For Daley it is even more difficult to play central defender on the right side. It is completely uncomfortable for him. He cannot be a good builder of the game when this is one of his good qualities. Marcos is trying hard and is fine, but it\u2019s a very important starting point for the stability of the team. Even in matches where we didn\u2019t concede goals with them against Man City and Burnley were home matches and we managed to play with a high percentage of the ball and managed to play with the defensive line almost in the midfield.\u201d Despite Bastian Schweinsteiger now training again he is not in contention for Swansea. \u201cNo, because I decide and I decide no,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early for him. He\u2019s training with the team for three or four days. He\u2019s not ready to play football at that level.\u201d Antonio Valencia is also injured and with Ander Herrera suspended and Mourinho serving his touchline ban at the Liberty Stadium the manager was asked how difficult it would be to execute his duties from the stands. \u201cForget it,\u201d he said."
"4||Memphis Depay set to leave Manchester United in winter transfer windowMemphis Depay is open to a move away from Manchester United as he recognises his career at the club may be over. The Dutchman is willing to go out on loan in January as Fenerbahce retain a firm interest in him. Depay was left behind for Thursday\u2019s 2-1 defeat in Turkey, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho unable to find a place for the 22-year-old in the 21-man squad despite the Europa League being a low priority for the manager. It is understood that Depay would consider leaving the club and a temporary deal in the winter window is more likely than a permanent departure then. Depay is conscious a transfer is more realistic next summer and Dick Advocaat, Fenerbahce\u2019s manager, remains an admirer after giving the Dutchman his professional debut for PSV Eindhoven. Before Fenerbahce\u2019s victory over United Advocaat signalled he is aware that Depay is considering his future when saying: \u201cThe potential is there for him to be a good player. You cannot lose that. He has the quality to be a top player but the problem for him is that there are so many quality players in that squad. \u201cSo for himself it is important to start playing regularly at the age that he is at. Otherwise the way, I think, is that maybe he has to find another solution [club] because he is too good to sit on the bench. I still believe in him. He has the right mentality, the right character to play for United, but there are so many options there. Regular playing time will help his progression.\u201d Depay cost United \u00a325m and was Louis van Gaal\u2019s first signing of summer 2015 after the former manager moved to ensure PSV\u2019s top scorer in their title-winning side of the previous season joined the club when there were a host of other suitors. Depay was handed a first-team berth, Van Gaal playing him at first in the No10 position before moving him out wide. Yet Depay failed to impress consistently in his first season and ended it having started only 16 league matches with two goals. This season six of his seven appearances have come as a substitute."
"4||Ronald Koeman: Romelu Lukaku has potential to play for European eliteRonald Koeman has said Everton\u2019s most important move of the summer was convincing Romelu Lukaku to stay but believes the striker will be coveted by European heavyweights such as Bayern Munich and Real Madrid should the 23-year-old continue to improve. Lukaku returns to his former club Chelsea on Saturday having scored seven of Everton\u2019s 15 league goals this season and assisted in three. Chelsea wanted to re-sign the Belgium international in the summer but, having sold him for \u00a328m in 2014, refused to countenance Everton\u2019s prohibitive \u00a360m-plus price tag. The striker admitted this week that he was encouraged to remain at Goodison Park by an \u201chonest\u201d conversation with Koeman shortly after the Dutch coach had replaced Roberto Mart\u00ednez as manager. Koeman, however, insists the final decision rested with Lukaku and feels the striker has the potential to join the European elite. The Everton manager said: \u201cIn my position he was and is a very important player for the club and I did everything I could to keep him. But the final decision is down to the player and that\u2019s what happened. It was the most significant thing that happened in the summer. We try to be prepared because he will not play [for Everton] for always. He is a big striker who will always generate interest from big clubs and from bigger clubs than Everton but the boy is 23 and he took the right decision to stay. \u201cHe can improve and he needs to improve. That\u2019s good because it is very difficult to get a replacement for a player who compares to Romelu, maybe impossible. I was a little bit afraid to lose the player. Yes, we would have the money but we don\u2019t have a striker who would score 20-25 goals. It can be the most difficult situation but we got the decision and everybody was happy. \u201cMaybe we will get the same problem next season. I have read some stories about [moving in] January \u2013 no way, no way! Bayern Munich, Juventus, Madrid, Barcelona \u2013 he stays until the end of the season at least. OK, that needs to be the next step for him and then we as Evertonian people can be proud that he made that step by scoring goals. That\u2019s the best answer he can give on the pitch.\u201d Koeman has identified room for improvement in Lukaku\u2019s pressing game but believes the former Anderlecht and Chelsea player is already one of the most complete strikers in the Premier League. \u201cHe\u2019s a strong man in front, he\u2019s fast and one of the most clinical in front of goal,\u201d Koeman added. \u201cWe do a lot of finishing sessions during the week and he\u2019s impressive in how he scores and how comfortable he is in the last part of attacking. He will get more experience and he will get stronger. We try to do better pressing but that is a little bit more difficult because he needs to know when to run and when to start your run and to improve in every aspect of a football player. \u201cBut he is strong, he has the movement, he can keep the ball and he\u2019s one of the best. I had [Graziano] Pell\u00e8 at Southampton who was very strong and tall, really fast with the feet and to move, but Rom is a better finisher than Pell\u00e8 was. He is one of the most complete attack strikers we have. You can play a long ball to him. To play a long ball up to [Sergio] Ag\u00fcero is more difficult but they are top strikers and Rom is only 23 years old and the best needs to come.\u201d"
"5||NYPD officer fatally shot and another injured in New York City shootoutA New York police officer was fatally shot, and another was injured, after a shootout on Friday, officials said. \u201cIt\u2019s with tremendous sorrow that I inform of you of the murder of NYPD Sergeant Paul Tuozzolo,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters on Friday. According to the police commissioner, James O\u2019Neill, the shooting took place on Friday afternoon when two officers, Touzzolo and Emmanuel Kwo, identified the vehicle of a suspect of a home invasion in the Bronx borough of New York. The suspect fired at the officers with a handgun as they approached his vehicle, leading to an exchange of gunfire which left him fatally shot. After the shooting, the officers were rushed to the Jacobi medical center. Tuozzolo succumbed to his wounds, while Kwo is expected to survive a shot to the leg. Officials said the suspect was 35-year-old Manuel Rosales. He reportedly broke into the home of his estranged wife, where his three-year-old son, a 13-year-old child, and a 51-year old woman were also present. Officers received a description of his vehicle, which is how Kwo and Touzzolo later identified him. De Blasio and O\u2019Neill said they told Touzzolo\u2019s wife and parents an hour before they made the news public. \u201cThe city is mourning and the family is mourning,\u201d said De Blasio. Four NYPD officers have been killed in the last two years, most recently Randolph Holder who was shot in the head in October last year. Two days ago, two officers were shot in the Des Moines area in Iowa in \u201cambush-style\u201d killings, triggering a manhunt for the suspect in the case, who was captured eventually. Governor Andrew Cuomo confirmed the officer had passed away in a statement. \u201cToday, a sergeant in the New York City police department has made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty, and another officer is undergoing treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cMy deepest sympathies are with the families of the officers involved in today\u2019s tragedy in the Bronx, and with Commissioner O\u2019Neill and the NYPD as they cope with the loss of one of their own.\u201d"
"3||England\u2019s Scott Taylor primed for Scotland\u2019s challenge in Four NationsIt has been quite a year for Scott Taylor. A dyed-in-the-wool Hull FC fan, Taylor capped his first season with the club by helping them win the Challenge Cup at Wembley for the first time. Taylor\u2019s dream 2016 did not end there. His impressive form throughout the year earned him a call-up to the England squad for this autumn\u2019s internationals and the 25-year-old made his debut last month against France in Avignon. Taylor was left out for the 17-16 defeat to New Zealand last Saturday in the opening round of the Four Nations \u2013 but following an injury to the vice-captain, James Graham, the prop has been included in the England side that faces Scotland in Coventryon Saturday. With a likely winner-takes-all showdown coming against Australia at the London Stadium on 13 November, it is hard not to perceive the Scotland game as an open audition for Taylor to show he is worthy of a place against the Kangaroos. The forward, however, is refusing to look beyond the Bravehearts. \u201cIf I got to play against Australia in London it would be unbelievable,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cBut while I know that\u2019s round the corner I honestly haven\u2019t thought about it. I\u2019ll be giving it my all and do nothing different to what\u2019s got me into this position. If that\u2019s enough and I do enough to play against Australia then that would be unbelievable, but it\u2019s one step at a time at the minute.\u201d There was a feeling in some quarters that Taylor was unfortunate to miss out against the Kiwis after impressing on his debut, especially after a rave review from Wayne Bennett, the England coach. \u201cHe said I was tremendous,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cHe said it was one of my best performances all season from what he\u2019d seen. He said he was really happy with me but that I was unlucky against the Kiwis because he wanted to go with a bit more international experience, which I understood.\u201d With Graham sidelined due to a knee injury \u2013 he should return to face the Kangaroos \u2013 Taylor has the opportunity to take the frustration of missing out last week out on the Scots as the two sides meet at international level for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m not a good watcher. I was angry and passionate and wanted to be out there,\u201d he says. \u201cAs I was watching it I was getting angry and frustrated just like anyone really and I was devastated because I knew the boys had given it everything they had.\u201d England know only back-to-back victories over the next 10 days will secure a place in the final at Anfield and while they are heavy favourites to beat Scotland Taylor is refusing to write off a side heavily beaten by Australia on the opening weekend. \u201cScotland will come out flying and so will we. I\u2019m expecting a competitive, fierce Test match that will be good to watch,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve not even spoken about racking up the points. You always want to win a game by as many as possible, so it is what it is. We know they\u2019re coming to play, but we\u2019ll be ready for them.\u201d For the second part of the double-header at the Ricoh Arena Johnathan Thurston returns for Australia to face New Zealand. The Golden Boot holder was among a number of key players left out last week. \u201cI\u2019m expecting it to be nice and tough,\u201d he says. \u201cWe played them before we came over here and they got hold of me a couple of times and no doubt it won\u2019t be any different. \u201cI might have to try and give them one back but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m big enough.\u201d"
"3||GB strike double gold in team pursuit at Track World Cup in GlasgowGolden present and rosy future met in the track centre here on Friday night, at least as far as British women\u2019s team pursuiting went. The Rio gold medallist Joanna Rowsell-Shand watched a youthful British quartet of Emily Kay, Emily Nelson, Eleanor Dickinson and Manon Lloyd ride to a composed victory in the 4,000m, along with the \u201cfifth woman\u201d in the Rio squad, Ciara Horne, while another Rio gold winner Katie Archibald has been mentoring the team this weekend. On this showing there is every chance that one or more of the youngsters will be pressing their seniors hard in the run-in to Tokyo. Together with the former sprinter Dani Khan, who rode Thursday\u2019s qualifying round before giving way to Kay, they exude promise and enthusiasm. Nelson and Lloyd are about to celebrate their 20th birthdays \u2013 on Saturday for Lloyd, next weekend for Nelson \u2013 while Kay is relatively senior at 21, and Dickinson is 18, fresh from riding the European Championships a few weeks ago as a junior, and such a new inclusion in the squad she has barely trained with her team mates. The quintet timed their run perfectly for this World Cup. They qualified second fastest on Thursday, then disposed of the Poland quartet in the second round before taking on the Italians \u2013 the fastest qualifiers and the European champions \u2013 in the final. For all their youth they have a wealth of junior and under-23 gold medals at world and European level behind them \u2013 Kay and Nelson won the junior world team pursuit championship here in 2013 \u2013 and they needed that experience in the final, where the Italians were constantly ahead but never by more than around half a second. Lloyd, who had put in a massive lap and three-quarter starting effort to get the team up to speed, paid the price and pulled up with four laps to go. At the same time Italy\u2019s Simone Frapporti swung up for one last time, leaving both teams with the minimum three counters in the final kilometre. It then came down to who had most strength left and when Maria-Giulia Confalioneri slipped off the back of the Italian string with two laps remaining, the crowd sensed a gold medal was imminent if the three British women could keep close to each other\u2019s wheels. By the gun Confalioneri was half a dozen lengths adrift of her team-mates, while the young Britons hung together, inspired by the crowd, according to Kay. \u201cWhen you go into a ride like that and know it\u2019s going to be close, you try to keep to your ride,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can hear the crowd. In a weird way they gave you that extra bit of energy. Down that back straight going into the last lap I had to fight to stay together until the end and I think that made the difference.\u201d Similarly, the Great Britain men\u2019s endurance squad have more than a whiff of the future about them, including a 19-year-old Matt Bostock, a 20-year-old Oliver Wood and a 21-year-old Mark Stewart, who comes from Dundee and the former kilometre rider Kian Emadi-Coffin, who is making the transition from sprinting, plus the seasoned Andy Tennant. Tennant, Wood, Emadi-Coffin and Stewart had to endure a false start in the final against France, who included the Tour de France veteran Sylvain Chavanel along with the promising Corentin Ermenault, who has been linked with Sir Bradley Wiggins\u2019s eponymous team for next season. The British went out fastest and while the French fought back in the second kilometre and ran the home team close throughout the Britons ran out relatively comfortable gold medallists by 1.339sec, but again breaking the 4min barrier to do so. Continuing the theme of youthful promise, the sprinter Ryan Owens, who travelled to Rio as a reserve, qualified second fastest in a promising 9.890sec, and ended up fourth after being taken to three rounds in the quarter-final by his team-mate Joe Truman. At 20 and 19 respectively they have plenty of time ahead and that is something most of the Great Britain team here have in common."
"6||Australia should go to Papua and see the human rights situation for itselfAs Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo, touches down in Australia for the first time since assuming the presidency, will human rights feature at all in the talks? Indonesian officials are already working overtime to control the agenda, with the defence minister, Ryamizard Ryacudu, warning Australia against \u201cinterfering in the West Papua issue\u201d and asking Australia to send a message to Pacific Island nations that support autonomy for Papuans. Ryamizard told an Australian journalist, with no apparent irony: \u201cThose countries better keep their mouths shut and mind their own business. It is better that Australia speaks to them gently. If it was left up to me, I would twist their ears.\u201d Although Australia has consistently supported Indonesian sovereignty over Papua, the issue remains one of various sensitivities in the Australia\u2013Indonesia relationship. But that discomfort does not give Indonesia a free pass to commit human rights abuses in the province, nor should Australia shy away from discussing such matters at the highest levels. The provinces of Papua and West Papua are a remote, isolated region, where the OPM (Free Papua Movement) has led a low-level insurgency for decades. That insurgency has long been the excuse for significant military involvement in Papua. With the heightened police and military presence, there have been reports of security force abuses including killings, torture, excessive or unnecessary use of force, and mistreatment of peaceful protesters. At least 37 Papuans remain behind bars for peaceful acts of free expression or expressing solidarity with the independence movement. All of this impunity is aided by reduced scrutiny of abuses as foreign journalists and human rights organisations face a half century-long restriction on visiting the province. Perhaps Indonesia feels especially confident in rallying Australian support, since it scored something of a coup in August with the Papua visit by the attorney general, George Brandis. He was the first Australian cabinet minister to visit Papua, and human rights were glaringly absent from all public statements he made about that visit. His choice of travelling companion was also troubling \u2013 he was accompanied by Wiranto, Indonesia\u2019s poster child for impunity for serious abuses. Wiranto, the co-ordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, was Indonesia\u2019s armed forces chief in 1999 when the military and government-backed militias carried out atrocities against the East Timorese after they voted for independence. In fact, given that background, it\u2019s even more important for the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and foreign minister, Julie Bishop, to ask some hard questions about what Indonesia is doing to address human rights violations in Papua and how Australia can help. Australian acceptance of Indonesian sovereignty over Papua does not mean discussion of human rights concerns in Papua should be taken off the table. Let\u2019s remember that Jokowi himself has previously called for greater respect for human rights in Papua and for the Indonesian government to stop blocking foreign journalists and observers from visiting Papua. Here\u2019s one suggestion that Turnbull could broach with Jokowi: if Indonesian officials are so keen to gain Australia\u2019s support on Papua, then why not allow a multi-party parliamentary delegation from Australia, accompanied by journalists, free access to visit the province? Australia\u2019s parliament has long had an interest in the region, with a Parliamentary Friends of West Papua group co-chaired by Jane Prentice MP and Senator Richard Di Natale. Such a visit, not a junket, should include a range of Australian politicians armed with expertise in trade, tourism, economic and social portfolios and include meetings with Papuan leaders, civil society, imprisoned activists and ordinary Papuans. In fact, when General Luhut Pandjaitan, then coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs, visited Canberra in June he extended an invitation to the Australian government to visit Papua, saying, I ask also any member of the cabinet to join us to go there. We have nothing to hide. It is not the time to hide something. Let us work together to make it transparent. If you want to criticise Indonesia we are happy to receive that criticism. But please, give that criticism based on data, not rumour. A visit would help Australian politicians understand more about a region only a few hundred kilometres to our north that remains isolated and undeveloped. It would enable Australians to hear directly from Papuans about the issues affecting their lives \u2013 surely this is part of what Jokowi wants in trying to win the hearts and minds of Papuans. Elaine Pearson is the Australia director at Human Rights Watch."
"3||Warren Gatland fears Lions could \u2018die\u2019 if tour matches are cutWarren Gatland fears the British &amp; Irish Lions could \u201cdie as an entity\u201d if a proposal to cut the number of matches they play from 10 to five goes through. Eight months out from the tour to New Zealand for which he will be the coach, Gatland\u2019s thoughts are already racing beyond to 2021, because rugby\u2019s administrators are negotiating over the shape of the international calendar from 2019 onwards. At the ceremony to announce the 2017 Lions jersey, Gatland said: \u201cI would hate to see the Lions go in for five matches. You would lose the mystique of what the Lions are all about.\u201d If anything, Gatland believes the Lions\u2019 tours should be longer, to give the team more time to prepare. They will play the first match of their 2017 tour on 3 June, only one week after the Premiership and Pro12 finals, which take place on Saturday 27 May. Gatland expects about \u201ca third to a half\u201d of his squad will be involved in one or other of the two matches. Those players will fly out to New Zealand on Monday and arrive on Wednesday, three days before the opening game against the Provincial Union XV. Gatland made a similar recommendation in his report on the Lions\u2019 successful 2013 tour to Australia, which he felt could be summed up in three words: \u201cpreparation, preparation, preparation\u201d. It is too late to change the 2017 schedule but for 2021 the New Zealander wants the clubs and competitions to agree to structure the season so the Lions have an extra week to get ready, mainly to give the team more time to bond before practice matches. \u201cThe challenge is to get everyone on the same page as quickly as I can, and another week or two would be ideal,\u201d Gatland said. The harder those warm-up games are before the Test series starts, the happier he will be. \u201cIf I look back on the experience of the last two tours, there were too many games in Australia and South Africa that were too easy. There is no point in the Lions winning by 50 points,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we go down to the wire in some tough games, if we get beaten while we\u2019re trying some combinations, that\u2019s fine, because it is all about winning the Test series, the more battle-hardened we are, the better prepared we are going to be.\u201d Gatland, on sabbatical from the job as the Wales coach, also thinks a shorter tour would have an impact on the number of fans who would travel across the world in order to watch the Lions play. \u201cIf you were playing five matches, two warm-ups and three Tests, I don\u2019t think there would be the same interest, and I don\u2019t think most of the tour packages would be sold out,\u201d he said. He believes the long lead-up to the first Test, and the tradition of playing midweek matches around the country, are part of the appeal and he added it is the large number of travelling fans that make the Lions so popular in the southern hemisphere. \u201cWatch All Blacks games at Eden Park and 95% of the fans are All Blacks supporters,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cThat\u2019s fine but they\u2019re very excited about going to a ground where there\u2019s red everywhere. \u201cIn the southern hemisphere they never get to experience what we get in the Six Nations, where 40% or more of the crowd are away fans, and that\u2019s what makes the atmosphere.\u201d He hopes the game\u2019s \u201cstakeholders thrash out what\u2019s best, because I would hate to see the Lions die as an entity and not have an opportunity to prepare properly\u201d."

"5||Playboy model charged over Snapchat of naked woman in gym locker roomA Playboy model who used social media to shame a woman at her gym was charged with invasion of privacy by the Los Angeles city prosecutor on Friday, just three months after her Snapchat post mocked the 70-year-old. The charge was filed against Dani Mathers, a 29-year-old model, on Friday afternoon for secretly photographing a naked woman at her gym \u201cwith the intent to invade the privacy of that other person\u201d, according to the complaint. In July Mathers shared the photo with thousands of followers on Snapchat, with the caption: \u201cIf I can\u2019t unsee this, then you can\u2019t either.\u201d Mathers eventually apologized in a video, saying the public posting was accidental: \u201cThat was absolutely wrong and not what I meant to do.\u201d \u201cI know that body shaming is wrong,\u201d she added. \u201cThat is not the type of person I am.\u201d The gym, LA Fitness, revoked her membership and banned her from all its locations. At the time its executive vice-president, Jill Greuling, called Mathers\u2019 actions \u201cappalling\u201d and the gym reported the post to Los Angeles police, who said they began an investigation into \u201cillegal distribution\u201d of the photo. \u201cWhile body shaming, in itself, is not a crime,\u201d city attorney Mike Feuer in a statement, \u201cthere are circumstances in which invading one\u2019s privacy to accomplish it can be. And we shouldn\u2019t tolerate it\u201d. \u201cBody shaming is humiliating, with often painful, long-term consequences,\u201d he added. \u201cIt mocks and stigmatizes its victims, tearing down self-respect and perpetuating the harmful idea that our unique physical appearances should be compared to air-brushed notions of \u2018perfect\u2019.\u201d Tom Mesereau, Mathers\u2019 attorney, told the Guardian on Friday that his client never intended to violate privacy law. \u201cI am very disappointed that Dani Mathers was charged with any violation,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cShe never tried to invade anyone\u2019s privacy and never tried to break any law.\u201d Mathers faces up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for the misdemeanor count of invasion, and she is scheduled for arraignment on 28 November. Earlier this year a California court ruled that a Snapchat secretly taken of a teenager, apparently masturbating in a bathroom stall, was an illegal invasion of privacy. Civil rights attorneys have largely agreed that, under California law, photography or filming without consent in a bathroom is a violation of the \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d. Taking that photograph was \u201ca flagrant violation of privacy law\u201d, explained Danielle Keats Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in privacy and cyber law. \u201cNaked in the bathroom \u2013 it\u2019s uncontested.\u201d"
"7||Why is Australia so obsessed with the espresso martini?When the coffee liqueur brand Mr Black opened sales for the world\u2019s first festival dedicated exclusively to the espresso martini, tickets sold out mere hours. It then added another day to the Melbourne festival \u2013 tickets for which sold out in seven minutes. It then added a third and final day \u2013 which again sold out. Clearly Australian drinkers, particularly Melburnians, are in the depths of a torrid love affair with the espresso martini. There are very few bars in Melbourne that can\u2019t or won\u2019t shake up an espresso martini. Bartender James Armstrong puts it succinctly: \u201cMelbourne loves coffee, Melbourne loves booze. It\u2019s literally the most Melbourne drink since a Melbourne Bitter.\u201d Despite this, the espresso martini is not at all a Melbourne invention \u2013 it was in fact invented in London during the 80s by the late, legendary bartender Dick Bradsell. The story goes that a famous model \u2013 Bradsell, the embodiment of old-school hospitable discretion, never said who \u2013 strode into his bar and asked for a drink that would first \u201cwake me up, then fuck me up\u201d. Bradsell obliged by whipping together the spirit du jour, vodka, some coffee liqueur, some simple syrup, and a shot of freshly pulled espresso. Bradsell christened the drink the \u201cvodka espresso\u201d but it wasn\u2019t long before it was given the name \u201cespresso martini\u201d. Once in Australia \u2013 the Melbourne bartender Fred Siggins suggests that it arrived via UK bartenders on working holiday visas \u2013 the espresso martini found a spiritual home in coffee-loving Melbourne. The bartenders I speak to about its popularity identify several reasons why it took off here. For David Ferris, it\u2019s the perfect common denominator: \u201cThey can fit in any setting: from fancy 40th-floor CBD cocktail bars to grimy rave clubs \u2026 If you have a group of five or more, you can\u2019t get them all to agree on a bitter Italian cocktail or something tequila-based \u2013 this drink works because it appeals to a really wide range of people.\u201d \u201cThe stimulant effect certainly plays a part,\u201d says a bar manager, Graham Espie, \u201ccoupled with Melburnians\u2019 entrenched sensibility to appreciate the bean in every available form.\u201d Venue managers seem to love the drink as much, if not more, than the customers who order it. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap as chips,\u201d Espie says. \u201cIt can cost the venue as little as three dollars, and is sold in some places for over $20.\u201d (Espie adds that at his venue, Howler, \u201cWe keep ours at a reasonable price and use good vodka.\u201d) While some of that mark-up is dedicated to labour costs, there is still some serious coin to be made from them \u2013 especially when compared with other drinks. \u201cI can only sell a vodka Red Bull for $12, when it probably cost me around two dollars and 80 cents to put up,\u201d says Clara Edmonds, \u201cbut I can sell an espresso martini for $20.\u201d The numbers involved are sometimes staggering: Espie estimates that Howler sells 10 times as many espresso martinis as any other cocktail, while Edmonds calculates that at one venue she worked at, more than 50% of the drinks she\u2019d ever made were espresso martinis. It seems that the only people who don\u2019t always feel the love for the drink are bartenders themselves. At a party filled with hospitality workers, I mention I am working on an article about espresso martinis. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about fucking espresso martinis!,\u201d one bartender spits. She has, it turns out, recently worked a shift where a hen\u2019s party came in bearing little signs on sticks printed with the words \u201cespresso martini\u201d, so they wouldn\u2019t have to bother talking to their bartender. Another contacts me when she finds out about this article with an impressively vitriolic rant: \u201cEvery arsehole who\u2019s never ordered anything other than Melbourne Bitter and the occasional rum and ginger orders 50 of them at a time under the delusion that it will make them appear to have some kind of class and half an idea about cocktails \u2026 I\u2019ve only met one or two bartenders that don\u2019t sigh or roll their eyes or contemplate suicide every time the words \u2018six expresso martinis thanks, mate\u2019 flop out of some drunkard\u2019s mouth.\u201d Espie argues that familiarity breeds contempt: \u201cMixologists yearn to remain at the cutting edge. If they feel that things are becoming mainstream, they don\u2019t want to be associated with it.\u201d It\u2019s true that, at least to the cocktail cognoscenti, there\u2019s something more than a little daggy about the espresso martini. The name itself is a remnant of the benighted cocktail culture of the 90s, when nearly everything served up in a v-shaped glass was a \u201c-tini\u201d of some sort: apple martini, French martini, flirtini. (Bradsell tried, after the drink had been rechristened as the espresso martini, to rename it the \u201cpharmaceutical stimulant\u201d but it never stuck.) And, as Edmonds notes, it commits another cocktail crime: continuing the somewhat disreputable Prohibition-era trick of disguising the taste of liquor with strong, sweet flavours: \u201cThe espresso martini\u2019s flavour masks the booze \u2013 you can use, excuse my French, shit vodka in an espresso martini and still make it taste good. Particularly in Melbourne, because we have such good coffee.\u201d The flexibility of the cocktail has encouraged experimentation to keep it on-trend, with some Melbourne bars taking it beyond Bradsell\u2019s original four-ingredient recipe. The easiest tweak is a more flavoursome spirit base than the original vodka, such as rum or tequila. More high-end bars use pretty recherch\u00e9 techniques to tart up the drink. Bartender Dominique Cacioli, for instance, developed a version that pairs a chilled base \u2013 Illy espresso liqueur, Chambord, and Woodford Reserve bourbon, blended together and barrel-aged \u2013 with a hot foam flavour, and bitter white chocolate floating on top. Eau-de-Vie Melbourne\u2019s house espresso martini variation similarly comes topped with a liquid nitrogen\u2013chilled sabayon. For professionals in the coffee industry, the espresso martini\u2019s popularity is something of a double-edged sword. Elika Rowell, co-owner of Melbourne coffee roastery Square One, thinks it\u2019s time to reconsider: \u201cChilling espresso over ice shocks it into severe bitterness \u2013 a totally undesirable trait in coffee. Yes, you can add simple syrup to it to try to put a veil over that bitterness, but it will always taste muddy or dirty. Why does everyone want to use a product that actually doesn\u2019t taste good unless you add sugar to it?\u201d Her suggestion? Bars should talk to their coffee suppliers first. \u201cThere are so many awesome coffees around that all taste totally different ... Picking a coffee to suit what you\u2019re doing could be really challenging, but also super-interesting.\u201d According to bartender Clara Edmonds, any drink that wants to take over as the king of caffeinated cocktails would have to jump more than a few hurdles. \u201cPlease, any bartender out there, give me a better option. One that is accessible to everyone, enjoyable for everyone, price-pointed for every owner, easy to make, one that every bartender knows how to make.\u201d If a drink nails all of those key components, Edmonds says, \u201cit will probably take off. But until that better drink comes along, I think the espresso martini will still be Melbourne\u2019s cocktail.\u201d \u2022 The Festival of the Espresso Martini runs until 6 November at the Meat Market, North Melbourne"

"8||Despite the Harvard soccer team decision, men are rarely punished for overt misogynyThe fact that the Harvard men\u2019s soccer team kept a sexual \u201cscouting report\u201d on freshman members of the women\u2019s team is both abhorrent and mostly unsurprising. The only surprise is that such low treatment of women has been documented at all. Most of us, especially at a place like Harvard (I graduated from there in 2013), have learned to avoid making our sexist, racist or otherwise bigoted thoughts so overt by now. We are adept at couching them in traditions and social institutions or confounding them with diversity rhetoric and tokenism. In contrast, this so-called \u201cscouting report\u201d, which the Harvard Crimson reported on last week, is a methodical assessment of the attractiveness of freshman female soccer players. The male soccer players assigned each woman a numerical score, a nickname and a sexual position along with a paragraph weighing her sex appeal. The document was kept on Google Drive and appears to have been amended by members of the men\u2019s soccer team each year since it started in 2012. Its release amounts to the outing of a group of men so confident in the unassailability of their privilege as to revel in it, record it and build a team culture around it. Harvard College made an attempt to rectify institutionalized inequality in last year\u2019s decision to bar members of exclusive \u201cfinal clubs\u201d \u2013 single-sex, exclusive social clubs \u2013 from occupying leadership roles in school-sanctioned clubs or athletics and from receiving top academic scholarships like Rhodes or Fulbright. The move was a broad-stroke attempt to dismantle what the dean of the college, Rakesh Khurana, called, in a public letter \u201cthe perpetuation of spaces that are rife with power imbalances\u201d. Such power imbalances, of course, are the context in which a 2015 survey found that 31% of Harvard senior undergraduate females had experienced sexual assault during their time on campus. They are also the context in which Harvard is fighting a Title IX lawsuit by a recent graduate accusing the school of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to her case after she reported being sexually abused by another student. The cancellation of the remainder of the men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s season, while fair, is insufficient punishment in the larger context of Harvard\u2019s entrenched misogyny problem. The season was already close to its end, so the punishment amounts to a relatively minor rebuke for the many male soccer players who have contributed to this codified team activity of demeaning their female counterparts over the last four years. It\u2019s been a big year for watching sexual harassment charges bounce off of highly privileged white men. Donald Trump initially suffered in polling after the incriminating Access Hollywood tape was released; Stanford swimmer Brock Turner was subject to criminal charges and internet vitriol after he was accused of rape; and these Harvard soccer players have lost the chance to compete in the NCAA tournament this season. But then the gap in the presidential polls slimmed, Turner was sentenced to only six months in jail, and the soccer players just have a little more free time over the next few weeks than they expected. This should not be the end of it. This imperviousness often leaves women, people of color and other oppressed groups trying to pin down the plausibly deniable injustices that imbue their lives. This has fed the recent student demands for safer spaces and higher cultural sensitivity at colleges and universities throughout the country, most notably at Yale and Oberlin. We try to police micro-aggressions and cultural appropriation because there are often not more substantial things to grab on to and eradicate. And when there are, we apparently hesitate to punish the patriarchy being enacted before our eyes. We should not have to wait for events like the release of this despicable soccer document to expect more systemic and sustainable steps, both by administrations to support students and by these male athletes and others to set a standard of real respect for their female peers. These soccer players should be required to demonstrate genuine contrition and to attempt real reform in order to deserve their spots on a team that represents Harvard College. (Ed note: they issued an apology in the Harvard Crimson after this column was originally published.) Hopefully this will force even male teams or clubs that don\u2019t maintain written assessments of women\u2019s attractiveness to examine the ways they participate in power imbalances. Harvard\u2019s response is a good start, but it\u2019s only that."
"2||Pinochet's torture ship sails into Sydney, sparking protestsThe appearance of a Chilean naval vessel in Sydney Harbour, which had been used as a \u201ctorture chamber\u201d by the Pinochet regime, has sparked protests from Chilean-Australians who say it should be removed from service. The Esmeralda, a four-masted tall ship that is nearly 400ft long, is in Sydney as part of its 61st training cruise and has been docked at Garden Island since Thursday morning. Considered a national symbol of Chile, it is used as a sail training vessel by the country\u2019s navy and spends about half the year sailing around the world. It was last in Sydney in 2012. But its tours have sparked controversy after a series of human rights reports revealed that the ship was used to detain victims of the Augusto Pinochet\u2019s regime in September 1973. A 1986 US Senate report suggesting that as many as 112 people \u2013 including 40 women \u2013 were held on the ship, with rape, electric shocks, mock executions and beatings among the crimes reportedly carried out on board. A British-Chilean priest, Father Michael Woodward, who had been tortured on board, was taken off the vessel for treatment at a naval hospital but died of his injuries in transit. In 2003 Amnesty International urged Chile\u2019s government and navy to acknowledge serious human rights violations committed on the boat. In light of its bloody history, its continued use has prompted quayside protests around the world. At the weekend the Esmeralda will be docked at the Sydney fleet base on Cowper Wharf Road in Woolloomooloo and open to the public for guided tours. The Chile Solidarity Committee, a Sydney-based organisation of about 50 people, intends to protest against the vessel\u2019s appearance on Saturday. An organiser, Vlaudin Vega, said the Esmeralda had been used as a \u201ctorture chamber\u201d in 1973 but the Chilean navy had never acknowledged that chapter in the ship\u2019s history. \u201cWe need to tell the world, the Australian people, that in this vessel crimes were committed and the navy needs to respond.\u201d More than 330 crew are onboard the ship. Vega suggested that, because of their age, many would be unaware of its history. He said removing the ship from service would be a symbolic gesture that would help the Chilean community to \u201cheal those wounds\u201d of Pinochet\u2019s regime, though that might require a \u201cmore radical government\u201d in Chile. \u201cRegardless of what the present purpose of the ship is, crimes were committed there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople got killed there. \u201c[The navy needs] to take into account what happened to the most prestigious ship that they have \u2026 There\u2019s no question it\u2019s a beautiful ship but they need to retire it as a symbol of some accountability.\u201d The Chilean-Australian Association, the consulate general of Chile in Sydney and the embassy of Chile in Australia \u2013 which have promoted the Esmeralda\u2019s appearance in Sydney \u2013 have been contacted for comment. The ship is due to depart on Monday afternoon and will return to Chile next month."
"2||Norfolk Island body issuing Australian gambling licences to be shut downThe Norfolk Island Gaming Authority will be shut down after a scathing report found it to be \u201cbarely viable\u201d, failing in its regulatory role, and with internal controls that could \u201cgive rise to fraud and corruption\u201d. The report, based on a two-month investigation of the authority and the Norfolk Island administration, found a litany of serious concerns including a lack of transparency, oversight, or resources, a disregard for risks or appropriate regulation, and serious concerns over conflicts of interest in appointments. \u201cThe authority and the former administration have been more concerned about raising revenue from gaming licences than having due regard to its regulatory functions,\u201d the report said. \u201cWe recommend that it not continue to operate in its current form.\u201d The gaming authority of the Pacific island \u2013 an Australian territory \u2013 was reviewed in April and May of this year under instruction by the Norfolk Island administration, after concerns were raised about its practises. The then federal minister for territories, Paul Fletcher, revoked the authority\u2019s power to license betting agencies in April following revelations it had effectively given permission for the world\u2019s largest illegal betting organisation to operate. The report, released by the federal government on Saturday, came to the overall conclusion that the gaming authority was \u201clargely ineffective\u201d and had \u201cfailed to fulfil its regulatory role to an acceptable level\u201d. The federal minister for local government and territories, Fiona Nash said there was no choice but to shut down the authority based on the final report, and an earlier draft, by the assessor, Centium. \u201cGambling in Australia must be carefully regulated to ensure the integrity of our sport and to protect consumers,\u201d Nash said. \u201cBefore arriving at this decision, I asked Centium to undertake a further assessment to determine whether it would be possible to rectify the myriad of issues identified in the first report. \u201cCentium\u2019s report made it abundantly clear that the authority is beyond redemption and that these problems cannot be resolved satisfactorily. As a result, I am entirely confident that closing the authority is the right thing to do.\u201d The report found the authority was \u201clargely ineffective\u201d in regards to two thirds of Centium\u2019s terms of reference, and \u201cpartially ineffective\u201d for the rest. It found the authority was \u201cgrossly under-resourced\u201d. \u201cBasic control elements are not in place, such as: governance and reporting structures, a risk register, contracts with key personnel, segregation of duties, controls to prevent conflicts of interest, staff remuneration processes and policies and procedures.\u201d It found the internal control system was lacking, leading to a perception that it was \u201chighly susceptible to fraud and corruption\u201d. The investigation found the director of the authority had not formally disclosed he was the brother-in-law of the former Norfolk Island chief minister and minister for tourism, industry and development, and concerns had been raised about the latter\u2019s influence on internal audits. The appointment of a lottery agency\u2019s chief operating officer as a contractor to provide regulatory services was also a \u201cserious error of judgement\u201d by the authority and its director, who the report said was aware of the contractor\u2019s position. \u201cThere is a clear conflict of interest between the authority and a person it regulates,\u201d it said. \u201cThe board should have been advised of this conflict. Importantly, none of the licensees interviewed by us were aware of his senior position with a competing licensee.\u201d Nash said current betting agencies have until March 2017 to find licenses in other jurisdictions, and the federal government will cover the \u201csmall shortfall\u201d in revenue for Norfolk Island. From July Norfolk Island lost the right to self-govern after it was brought under Australian tax and welfare systems, an act which caused split among the island\u2019s community."
"6||Ominous news for Aleppo as Russian frigate reaches Syrian coastA Russian frigate armed with cruise missiles has passed through the Bosphorus on its way to the eastern Mediterranean in a potentially ominous development for the embattled Syrian city of Aleppo. The Admiral Grigorovich, part of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, arrived off the Syrian coast on Friday as the latest pause in the Russian bombardment of eastern Aleppo came to an end, adding to an emphatic Russian show of naval force in the Mediterranean. Unlike the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier and Peter the Great nuclear-powered battle cruiser, whose arrival in the region has drawn considerable publicity, the newly commissioned Grigorovich has a fearsome ground attack capability in the form of Kalibr land-attack cruise missiles. Three Russian submarines from Russia\u2019s northern fleet capable of firing Kalibr missiles are also reported to have arrived in the Mediterranean. Russia has used Kalibr missiles, equivalent to US Tomahawk missiles, against Syrian targets a handful of times over the past year. The concentration of forces in the eastern Mediterranean in support of the Syrian regime\u2019s ambitions to retake Aleppo from rebel forces, suggest they may be used again in the coming few days or hours. Earlier this week, Vladimir Putin warned Syrian rebels and civilians trapped in eastern Aleppo to leave the city by Friday night, when a temporary moratorium on air strikes was set to expire. But opposition groups told the Guardian that promised safe passages out of besieged areas did not exist. As the deadline drew near, opposition groups pushed on with an assault on loyalist west Aleppo, while residents seemed resigned to a resumption in airstrikes. \u201cNothing can be done. Nobody can stop the planes,\u201d Bebars Mishal, an official with the White Helmets volunteer rescue service, told Reuters. The Kuznetsov battle group paused in its approach towards Syria off the east coast of Crete on Thursday, to carry out aviation exercises. Russian ministry of defence footage showed warplanes taking off and landing on its deck. The Kuznetsov is carrying about 10 Sukhoi-33 and four Mig-29 fighter aircraft, as well as up to two dozen helicopters. Although the Su-33s have recently been adapted to drop bombs more accurately, the plane has never been used for ground attack. Only the Mig-29 is designed for that purpose. If the planes are used to bomb targets in Syria, it would mark the first time Russia has used its only aircraft carrier in combat. That lack of experience, however, may limit its usefulness. \u201cThere are very few carrier-trained pilots. In fact, there are more planes than pilots, and most of the planes on board are not made for ground attack. For naval aviation this is largely a training run,\u201d Michael Kofman, a Russian specialist at the Centre for Naval Analyses, a federally funded research institute. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done anything done anything like this in a long time, and its getting heavily covered by the local and international media,\u201d said Peter Zwack, a retired US brigadier general and former military attache to Moscow, now at the National Defence University. \u201cThey are arriving in the eastern Mediterranean right before our election. It\u2019s posturing and secondarily adding capability in Syria.\u201d The visit of its flagship to the Mediterranean is also a morale-boosting demonstration of military capacity for the Russian navy, which has not played a significant role in the Ukraine or Syrian conflicts, but which is seen by Vladimir Putin as vital to Russian self-image as a global power. \u201cRussia\u2019s naval presence in the Mediterranean is as much about military posture and ability to project power beyond its region as much as the Syria campaign in general. Moscow sees it as important attributes of a \u2018great power\u2019,\u201d said Maxim Suchkov, an expert on the Russian Foreign Affairs Council and an editor at Al-Monitor covering Russian relations with the Middle East. The importance of image to this naval expedition is illustrated by the fact that Russian sailors have spent several days during its Mediterranean journey painting its deck bright blue, presumably so it looks better in aerial photographs. The carrier has had a long and troubled history. It was launched in 1985, but took a decade to become fully operational. It was first called the Riga, then renamed the Leonid Brezhnev as the former Soviet premier died, and then the Tbilisi, after the Georgian capital, and then rechristened after the Soviet Union fell apart and Georgia gained independence. It was initially armed with a dozen Granit anti-ship missiles, but those have recently been removed to make more space for aircraft. The carrier has had persistent problems with its propulsion system, based on turbo-pressurised boilers, which belch out black smoke due to an excess of fuel over air in its engines. They have frequently broken down and require the Kuznetsov to be accompanied on high seas duty by a tug. The ship has spent more time in port than at sea and will be out of action for several years for refurbishment from next year. It is accompanied by the Peter the Great, a massive battle cruiser, with a fearsome array of missiles, but which are designed to hit planes, ships and submarines rather than attack land targets. A more potent threat from the flotilla sent from Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet may have escorted the Kuznetsov under the surface. UK reports, quoting British government sources, say two nuclear-powered Akula-class and one diesel-powered Kilo-class submarine have been spotted trailing the battle group into the Mediterranean. At the same time as the Kuznetsov left Murmansk, two destroyers left Vladivostok, the headquarters of the Pacific Fleet. Those destroyers, the Bystry and the Admiral Tributs, are reported to be off the Gulf of Aden. Kofman said that they could be on call in case the Kuznetsov encounters engine trouble, \u201cpossibly a Plan B for nervous admirals\u201d. However, the Bystry, has the same unreliable propulsion system. The arrival of the Grigorovich and the Russian submarines armed with cruise missiles could add to the devastation being wreaked on eastern Aleppo, home to 275,000 people. However, if that was Russia\u2019s only aim, it could easily increase the number of planes it bases at Hmeimim air base, near Latakia. The flexing of naval muscle is about geopolitical image as much as military firepower, but it carries with it the risk of humiliation. The Russian naval base at Tartus is not equipped to host large ships like the Kuznetsov and there are no friendly naval bases nearby in case of breakdown. \u201cIt\u2019s a dice roll,\u201d Kofman said. \u201cIf anything happens it will be a long tow back home.\u201d \u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 8 November 2016 to correct a misspelling of Admiral Grigorovich."
"2||Public figures call on government to hold free vote on same-sex marriageA group of 114 allies of the LGBTI community have signed a statement calling for the government to ditch the same-sex marriage plebiscite and hold a free vote on marriage equality. The petition has been signed by authors Peter Carey and Mike Carlton, the Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore, actors Noeline Brown and Noni Hazlehurst, the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Ged Kearney, comedians Corinne Grant and Catherine Deveny, former Labor senator and Olympian Nova Peris and former president of the Jewish Community Council of Victoria Philip Bliss. \u201cWe believe a plebiscite on marriage equality is unnecessary, and will be costly and divisive,\u201d the statement read in part. \u201cWe are particularly concerned about the harm to vulnerable LGBTI people.\u201d It will be sent by marriage equality advocacy group Just Equal to parliamentarians as the Senate begins debate of the same-sex marriage plebiscite on Monday. The plebiscite bill is expected to be defeated, with Labor, the Greens, Nick Xenophon Team and Derryn Hinch against it. The Coalition\u2019s Dean Smith will abstain, but is prepared to vote against it if he has the casting vote. Just Equal spokesman Ivan Hinton-Teoh said: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see so many allies of LGBTI people getting behind the campaign to stop a marriage equality plebiscite and have a free vote instead. \u201cWe could never have done this without the help of the allies of LGBTI people, who want equal marriage achieved by an equal process, not a divisive, damaging and unnecessary public vote.\u201d If the bill is defeated as expected, attention will turn to whether the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, will advocate or allow a free vote on same-sex marriage, which he has not ruled out, or whether the government will maintain its policy for a plebiscite, as conservatives in the Coalition have demanded. There are two same-sex marriage bills currently in the lower house: one from Labor and one from a cross-party group. Labor\u2019s equality spokeswoman, Terri Butler, told Guardian Australia Labor would join the cross-party bill if a Coalition MP joined. But Coalition MPs have steadfastly maintained there is no \u201cplan B\u201d if the plebiscite bill is defeated and said marriage equality could be delayed for years. Labor, the Greens and others in favour of same-sex marriage may also introduce a Senate bill to increase pressure for a free vote. On Thursday, Turnbull said the bill was up for debate next week because it was \u201cvery, very time-sensitive legislation\u201d that had to pass before a plebiscite on 11 February. That contrasted with his approach to the Australian Building and Construction Commission bill, about which Turnbull said the government would not commit to a vote unless it could win. On Friday, he recognised the plebiscite bill was unlikely to pass on current numbers and called on Labor to support it. The Australian Marriage Equality co-chair, Alex Greenwich, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe plebiscite needs to be resolved and voted down as matter of urgency and we hope that can happen on Monday or Tuesday this week at the latest.\u201d Greenwich said AME would campaign to demonstrate the \u201cstrong and diverse support for marriage equality\u201d and why it was important for Australians through its Equality Campaign. He said once the plebiscite was defeated attention would shift from the process to the substance of marriage equality, which a majority of Australians support. Carlton said he signed Just Equal\u2019s statement because same-sex marriage was \u201ca simple matter of liberty and equality\u201d. \u201cNeither church nor state has business keeping same-sex couples from marrying,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people are entitled to cement their union in any way they see fit, just as heterosexual couples can.\u201d Carlton said it was \u201ctime to end discrimination\u201d and \u201ctime [parliament] did its job\u201d. He described the plebiscite as a \u201crort to avoid a catastrophic split in the Liberal party and the Coalition\u201d. Liberal MP Andrew Laming said the Coalition was committed to the plebiscite as the way to decide whether to legalise same-sex marriage. \u201cI don\u2019t see alternative paths if it goes down,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect there to be an alternative if [it does] \u2013 it was our election commitment.\u201d"

"3||Andy Murray beats Tomas Berdych at Paris Masters to close on world No1 spotAs Novak Djokovic\u2019s glorious reign of 122 weeks as the king of tennis edged towards a conclusion with a shock defeat in Paris on Friday, Andy Murray, the heir apparent for 76 weeks stretched over seven years, put one undoubtedly trembling hand on the crown. Murray, enjoying the season of his life, beat Tomas Berdych 7-6 (11-9), 7-5 in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters and will replace Djokovic as world No1 if wins his semi-final on Saturday against Milos Raonic. That would erase the 235 points between himself and the Serb and move him past the man who has been his master for most of their parallel careers \u2013 but who earlier succumbed to the world No10, Marin Cilic, for the first time in 15 encounters over eight years. The Croatian\u2019s 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) win in an hour and 44 minutes stunned a struggling Djokovic, who saved two match points despite nursing an injury to his right arm that has troubled him for months, and handed Murray the chance he has worked so hard for, not just the past month or so while collecting titles in Beijing, Shanghai and Vienna but for much of his 11 years on the Tour. Murray said: \u201cMaybe there were a few more nerves before but, once I got out there, no. It was a great atmosphere. It didn\u2019t really bother me. I don\u2019t know [how he will handle the pressure on Saturday]. I\u2019ve never been in this position before. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll deal with it. Normally in big matches, when you got on court, you feel fine. If I wasn\u2019t to get to No1 this year, I was looking to next year. If it happens, great. It\u2019s been a great few months for me and I\u2019ll try to finish this week the best I can.\u201d \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t my goal at the start of the week. It wasn\u2019t my goal two or three weeks ago. This is a long-term thing. To get to No1 is not about one match. It\u2019s about a whole season that you put together and 12 months of work. If it doesn\u2019t happen tomorrow, it can still happen in a few months. That is when I [originally] thought I\u2019d have a better chance of doing it. But I\u2019m not putting any extra pressure on myself.\u201d He also paid tribute to the incumbent. \u201cHe\u2019s not just the No1 player just now. He\u2019s one of the best players that\u2019s ever played \u2013 just like Roger [Federer] and Rafa [Nadal] have been, as well.\u201d He said of a dramatic first-set tie-break against Berdych: \u201cI played some good ones, he played some bad ones on the set points, and I just fought as hard as I could. I served pretty well in those moments, better than him. There were a few net cords that went my way. I dealt with the double-fault well. It didn\u2019t affect me.\u201d His win was littered with the usual sprinkling of magic and angst over nearly two hours on Court Central. In a tie-break that will make any highlights reel of the season Murray came from 6-1 down, saved seven set points, double-faulted with the most horrendous second serve for 8-9, watched a nailed-on Berdych winner drift long after banging the tape and allowed himself a huge, puffed-cheek gasp of relief when a double-fault give him set point at 10-9, on serve. After a shootout that lasted a quarter of an hour Murray put away an angled forehand to leave the Czech rooted to the baseline. Having constructed a mental mountain for himself after a first set of the highest quality, Berdych, not always the most resilient of players, dropped serve at the start of the second. But, steeling himself to the task, he broke back when Murray, serving for the match at 5-4, thrashed a forehand into the net. The Czech, who had gone for his shots all night, could not sustain the fightback, however, belting his sixth double fault. At the second attempt Murray had a match-winning serve wrongly overruled at 40-15, battled to deuce and put it to bed with consecutive aces, his fourth and fifth of an excellent match. Defeat was doubly painful for Berdych as it put him out of contention for the eighth and final place in the ATP World Tour Finals that start in London on Monday week. Djokovic could not have been more gracious afterwards, acknowledging that Murray, whom he has beaten 24 times in 34 matches, would be a worthy successor as the game\u2019s best player. \u201cIf he gets it, which he is in a very good position to do, he\u2019s definitely a player who deserves that,\u201d Djokovic said, as Murray\u2019s match against Berdych was playing out on TV screens all around him. \u201cUndoubtedly much respect for what he has done. We have known each other since very early days. We were 11 years old when we first played against each other. And to see how he has raised his level in the last 12 months is quite extraordinary. All I can say is that he\u2019s deservedly in the position he\u2019s in at the moment.\u201d Djokovic, who had looked so solid as he completed a career grand slam at Roland Garros in the summer, has seen his game slowly fracture around the edges under pressure on and off the court. He was as honest as he ever has been in addressing his dilemma. There are growing rumours he may soon part company with one of his coaches, Boris Becker, and Djokovic did not provide any evidence to the contrary. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. It\u2019s early to talk about it but the team that\u2019s there is there. I\u2019ll see what\u2019s gonna happen for next year.\u201d As for his own game and ambitions, Djokovic was equally candid. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I was going to feel [after finally winning the French Open, beating Murray in the final]. At a certain point I had to reach this kind of phase where I had to reflect and say: \u2018OK, I have played on the highest possible level for that much time.\u2019 The drop of form is normal in sports. I\u2019m not too concerned about how the future will go for me. I\u2019m just living in the moment and that\u2019s all.\u201d He added: \u201cIt would be disrespectful to all the players that I only talk about myself or Andy, even though we are in two top spots in the world at the moment. There are guys like Marin Cilic, for example, or Stan Wawrinka who are right behind. They keep on pushing, keep on fighting. This is sport. You can\u2019t always expect to win. In terms of what the future brings to me, that\u2019s not in my hands. I\u2019m going to keep playing at this level as long as I feel like that\u2019s the right thing for me.\u201d But this is Murray\u2019s moment. If he gets to the top of the mountain, he will be the oldest player to do so since John Newcombe, then 30, in 1974, and would join the 25 illustrious players who have ruled since the ATP introduced the ranking system in 1973. And as Djokovic said, no one could say he has not earned it."
"10||Fears over new Down's syndrome test may have been exaggerated, warns expertA safer prenatal test for Down\u2019s syndrome due to be introduced on the NHS is not predicted to lead to more pregnancies being terminated, according to one of Britain\u2019s most eminent statisticians. Sir David Spiegelhalter, professor for the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, said that the best evidence available suggests that the blood test, which will be made available in 2018, would lead to an increase of around 20 in the number of positive diagnoses made each year through screening. He added the test would result in far fewer women opting for invasive testing, reducing miscarriage numbers. Spiegelhalter cautioned that this evidence sometimes appeared to have fallen out of view in debates in which some campaigners have warned that a generation with Down\u2019s syndrome could be \u201cscreened out\u201d. \u201cPeople feel very strongly about it, of course they do. It\u2019s all the more reason to stand back and look at the figures,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a mismatch at the moment between the official basis on which this is being rolled out and the discussion around it.\u201d According to the Department of Health\u2019s own projections, Spiegelhalter said, more than 40 miscarriages would be avoided every year because far fewer women would be given amniocentesis, an invasive test in which a tiny amount of fluid is removed from the womb. He added, however, that it was impossible to predict exactly how families would respond to the new screening regime. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of concerns expressed about the increased number of terminations,\u201d said Spiegelhalter. \u201cIn the assumptions under the current model that\u2019s not the case. The estimate is that there wouldn\u2019t be a change.\u201d The new test, which works by detecting tiny quantities of foetal DNA circulating in the mother\u2019s blood, will be offered to about 10,000 women a year who are considered to have a higher chance of giving birth to a baby with Down\u2019s syndrome, or two rarer genetic conditions: Edwards\u2019 and Patau\u2019s syndromes. The test is offered after the standard screening that all pregnant women receive at 12 weeks, which involves an ultrasound and a blood test. According to recent Department of Health figures, 7,900 women agreed to an invasive test and 46 miscarried. More than 3,000 chose not to have the test for fear of losing their baby or because they would wish to continue with their pregnancy regardless of the result. The figures showed 1,031 Down\u2019s cases detected in a year. The blood test, which predicts Down\u2019s syndrome with more than 90% accuracy, means most high-risk women will be able to avoid amniocentesis. The government predicts that around 10,000 women would opt to have the non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT). Of these, the Department of Health predicts that most would be screened out and fewer than 1,500 would proceed to the invasive test, where 1,055 Down\u2019s cases would be positively identified. The motivation for introducing the new blood test is safety, but controversy has been building based on concerns that far more parents would be inclined to find out if their baby was affected by a genetic disorder, potentially leading to more pregnancies being terminated. In a BBC documentary last month, A World Without Down\u2019s Syndrome?, actor Sally Phillips, whose son Olly has Down\u2019s syndrome, raised concerns about the new test and highlighted the joy that her son had brought to her family. Spiegelhalter said he \u201cin no way seeks to criticise the campaign groups\u201d, but wants to give people access to the best evidence available. His analysis is due to be published on the website of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, which launched last week and will aim to provide unbiased statistics on public health and policy issues. Philip Dunne, the health minister, said: \u201cWe want women to be able to access the safest screening tests available, so based on the clinical evidence, we have approved the use of a new non-invasive prenatal test for Down\u2019s, Edwards\u2019 and Patau\u2019s syndromes. By offering non-invasive prenatal testing, fewer pregnant women will go on to be offered diagnostic testing which carries a risk of miscarriage.\u201d Lynn Murray, spokesperson for the campaign group Don\u2019t Screen Us Out, said that the concerns of those opposed to the policy went beyond the projected screening statistics. \u201cWe are very disappointed that the Department of Health have approved the NIPT roll-out without consultation with the very group that this is going to have the biggest impact on, people with Down\u2019s syndrome and their families,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government has admitted itself that it has made no assessment of the impact this will have on the community of people with Down\u2019s syndrome.\u201d"
"11||California politician likes climate change because 'our enemies' live in hot placesRandy Voepel is a big fan of climate change because America\u2019s \u201cenemies are on the equator\u201d and a warmer climate will make their lives worse. Voepel, a Republican running unopposed to be a California assemblyman, told a reporter in 2007 that he likes global warming because of the harm it will bring to certain nations and because \u201cwarmer weather gives the region warm days in November\u201d, the Voice of San Diego reported at the time. Nine years later, as he prepares to become a state legislator in the liberal Golden State, Voepel\u2019s unusual stance hasn\u2019t shifted. \u201cMost of our enemies live in hot climates, desert climates,\u201d he told the Guardian on Friday, saying he stands by his remarks. \u201cIt will probably have a negative effect on their environment.\u201d Voepel, currently the mayor of Santee, a San Diego suburb, has a history of making bizarre statements about communism, homelessness and the environment, among other things, according to the Los Angeles Times, which rounded up his most memorable comments over the years. Asked about his earlier remarks touting the benefits of climate change, Voepel told the Times: \u201cMost of the Muslim nations are in the hot areas of the world.\u201d When the Guardian asked for clarification, the mayor said: \u201cI\u2019m not at all against Muslims, but I reject sharia law. The Muslims that practice sharia law do not recognize the United States Constitution, and they do not recognize our laws or the European Union laws.\u201d The threats of sharia law are largely rooted in myths, and in recent years Republican politicians in the US have increasingly made inflammatory statements about supposed the dangers sharia law could bring to America. Many in the Republican party, including at times presidential candidate Donald Trump, have continued to reject the science of climate change. In the phone interview Friday, Voepel said: \u201cI believe only about 1% of climate change is impacted by human beings. The rest of the 99% is solar cycles, the natural wobbling of the earth and volcanic activities.\u201d A bulk of evidence shows that humans are responsible for about 100% of the warming since 1950. California has been a leader in the US with some of the most ambitious climate change policies, and Voepel said he would do his best to fight back. \u201cThe way California goes is the way the United States goes,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cI would vote no no no no no.\u201d The Times also found a television interview in which the mayor blamed homeless residents for stripping copper out of a park in Santee. \u201cI\u2019m getting attacked here by the Viet Cong, stealing my copper, and I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Voepel said at the time. He told the Guardian, \u201cIt isn\u2019t like I have a war going on against the homeless.\u201d On communism, the Times reported that Voepel once reportedly refused to give his autograph to someone claiming to be a Chinese national, saying, \u201cI respectfully decline to cooperate in any way with what I consider to be an enemy of the United States.\u201d \u201cChi-Coms are Chi-Coms,\u201d he told the reporter last week, referring to communists in China. Voepel is on track to represent a heavily Republican district, replacing a termed-out assemblyman. An earlier opponent dropped out in April and endorsed Voepel. There are 80 members of California\u2019s assembly who propose and vote on state policy. The mayor of 16 years told the Guardian that his positions match the conservative values of his constituents, adding: \u201cI\u2019m just a little more gutsy and flamboyant than most conservatives.\u201d"
"12||Lady Gaga to play Donatella Versace in American Crime Story, reports sayLady Gaga is tipped to play Donatella Versace in the third season of American Crime Story. According to Us Weekly, a source has claimed that the singer will star as the fashion mogul in a season set to focus on the death of her brother, Gianni Versace. The unconfirmed report would lead to a continuation of the star\u2019s relationship with the show\u2019s creator Ryan Murphy. Gaga starred in the past two seasons of his hit FX show American Horror Story. During a recent panel, Murphy was asked whether Gaga would make for good casting as Versace, to which he replied, with a grin, \u201cYa think?\u201d Versace/Cunanan: American Crime Story will examine the murder of the legendary designer by serial killer Andrew Cunanan in 1997. It will be filmed next year, at the same time as the second season of American Crime Story, which will focus on Hurricane Katrina. The first season of the show, set around the trial of OJ Simpson, was a hit with viewers and critics, winning five Emmys. Murphy is also working on a new show called Feud, which will examine the bitter rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Gaga is coming off the back of her hit country/pop album, Joanne, the fourth biggest debut of the year so far. She is also set to star in the remake of A Star is Born opposite Bradley Cooper."
"4||Gareth Southgate: \u2018You have to be honest or players lose faith and belief in you\u2019Gareth Southgate may be new to senior international management but as he prepares for the second half of a four-game audition for a role he is enjoying more than he expected, he admits he had concerns England would pay for their lack of big-match experience at Euro 2016. Having inherited Sam Allardyce\u2019s selection when stepping into the breach in September, the interim head coach will name his England squad on Sunday evening for the games against Scotland and Spain. Then he aims to broaden the leadership net to help the developing talent take greater responsibility and avoid the kind of freeze that cost Roy Hodgson\u2019s players so ignominiously against Iceland in France. \u201cOne of the concerns I had about the team going into the summer was there was not a lot of big-match experience,\u201d Southgate told the Football Journalism students at the University of Derby this week. \u201cPeople could argue Iceland isn\u2019t a big match but any match for England in a major championship is big pressure. \u201cIf you looked at the team 10 years ago, they would have had Terry, Ferdinand, Beckham, Lampard, Gerrard, Ashley Cole. They\u2019d all have been in regular semi-finals of the Champions League, they all had big tournament experience. \u201cIf you look at Spain and Germany, their guys have huge international experience but also most of their players at Madrid and Barcelona are challenging for La Liga every year [and] for the Champions League in high-pressure matches. So you\u2019re building up a block of experience and belief. \u201cMost of our team last summer were guys who hadn\u2019t been in that situation. Some of that can only come through experience, some of the understanding of how to deal with it comes from experience. Although painful for everybody, and I\u2019ve had my own painful experiences in an England shirt, you are stronger for it and it\u2019s then how you address it and move forward.\u201d Southgate could be forgiven for worrying about his own future, having been asked to look after England\u2019s final four games of the year after Allardyce\u2019s dramatic departure, but his graduation from nurturing the nation\u2019s grassroots up to the under-21s over the past five years means he is more focused on developing the country\u2019s needs. A resounding victory over Scotland in next Friday\u2019s World Cup qualifier at Wembley and a good performance in the friendly with Spain four days later would surely mean the full-time job is Southgate\u2019s to turn down but he is more interested in the players\u2019 development than his own. He wants to alleviate the burden of leadership from Wayne Rooney\u2019s shoulders, and nurture a captains\u2019 cabal. The 46-year-old, who won 57 caps for his country during his playing career, was in relaxed mood as he explained how his experiences in charge of the under-21s, who won the Toulon Tournament in the summer, can aid the seniors. The progress of players such as Jack Butland and Harry Kane has been accelerated by this approach. \u201cWith the under-21s we\u2019ve tried to develop as many leaders as possible, and that involves giving people as much responsibility as we can,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI think Wayne has had to lead a bit too much, a lot of the leadership has been resting on his shoulders. \u201cSo small things like different people doing a press conference the night before the game, like we did with Theo Walcott last time, mean other people come into experiences where they are out of their comfort zone. When we work in workshops or other sessions, we have different people leading the group, ensure different people are speaking up.\u201d When speaking to the Derby students, Southgate continued: \u201cPlayers are similar to you guys; it isn\u2019t always easy to speak in front of your peers. Putting them in uncomfortable situations, on or off the training pitch, are all things that can help them step forward and take responsibility. \u201cSo with the under-21s, we have a leadership group of five or six who take turns to do things like that and in the end they start to set the standards for the rest of the group. If somebody\u2019s late for training, or their recovery sessions, it was Nathan Redmond or James Ward-Prowse who was pulling them back into line, rather than me as the coach. \u201cI think that\u2019s more powerful if the team are doing that \u2013 and it saves me a lot of hassle! We want players to go out and take responsibility on the field so if we\u2019re not giving them responsibility off the field on a daily basis then it\u2019s very difficult for them to go and do it when they step up for a game.\u201d Southgate also believes maximising a relationship based on integrity between coach and player can improve performance. By offering truthful feedback rather than platitudes \u2013 or falsehoods \u2013 the coach would not only show concern for the individual player but aid his developing contribution to the team. \u201cI always thought it was helpful with the under-21s to have an honest conversation with a player. \u2018You\u2019re in the starting team and we think you need to work with this, this and this\u2019 or, \u2018you\u2019re in the squad but to get into the team, these are the areas you need to improve upon\u2019 or, \u2018you\u2019re in the squad and to stay in the squad you have to up your game\u2019. \u201cI think that feedback is really important to players, I think they value one-to-one discussions. I think it has got to be honest. There is no use saying: \u2018You\u2019re really unlucky not to be in\u2019 as it doesn\u2019t mean anything, you are not giving a player something he can go away and work at. \u201cSo I think it is important to be precise. Also players are pretty savvy; if you tell them something which they believe not to be true or in a couple of weeks\u2019 time it isn\u2019t true, then they\u2019ll lose faith and belief in you. Sometimes those conversations are really difficult as you have to leave a player out but I think you owe it to them to be honest.\u201d Southgate is a great believer in the long-term development of players and teams but is also intent on enjoying the here and now. Managing your country may look pretty stressful but it is also a major opportunity. \u201cI set out that, although it has been a great responsibility, we were going to enjoy it because I don\u2019t see the point of going into something and feeling it is a burden. I think the players would pick up on that most importantly. There will be games going on all over the country, with respect to the lower divisions, when I will be going out to [face] Scotland and Spain at Wembley so in the real world that is pretty exciting isn\u2019t it?\u201d Neither is it the most stressful, notwithstanding the beam of publicity that comes with leading the nation\u2019s football team. Being pitched into management at Middlesbrough at the age of 35, ironically when Steve McClaren left for the England job, was \u201cby far the most stressful experience of my life \u2026 The intensity of [managing England] is different but actually I think the pressure is what you decide it is.\u201d Dealing with a relegation at Middlesbrough, after two years in mid-table, and with England\u2019s failure to progress to the semi-finals of last year\u2019s European Under-21 Championship has not dented Southgate\u2019s vision of the way the game can be played but, despite the under-21s continuing with a passing game that showcases the FA\u2019s DNA paradigm, he offers a pragmatic perspective for how England can approach Russia 2018. Southgate has evidence that England\u2019s age-group teams from under-16s to under-21s, over whom he has been in charge, are as technically proficient as any. But now England have made catching up on dominating possession a priority, the next challenge follows: to be more durable mentally and to adapt tactics according to a given situation. This takes us back to where we came in which involves England players being capable of taking responsibility, being able to execute technique under pressure collectively. This will take time. Not many denigrate the technical abilities of Dele Alli, Ross Barkley, Jack Wilshere, Kane, John Stones et al. But England may need tough it out while this talented crew acquire the requisite mental resilience, Southgate suggests. \u201cYou could go to a European Championship like Portugal just did and scramble your way through,\u201d he said. \u201cThey found a different way to win and maybe that\u2019s what we will need to do to have immediate success short term because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be the No1-ranked team in the world in a few years, because of the age of our players. So we\u2019re going to have to be quite savvy in the ways that we get results.\u201d Gareth Southgate was speaking to students on the UK\u2019s only Football Journalism degree course at the University of Derby derby.ac.uk/journalism"
"13||Nasa begins testing enormous space telescope made of gold mirrorsNearly 20 years after its engineers began construction, Nasa began testing this week on the largest space telescope ever built, a 21ft arrangement of mirrors and instruments that is meant to succeed the Hubble telescope and look through 13bn years of space. Nasa administrator Charles Bolden announced that the agency had finished construction earlier this week on the James Webb Space Telescope, an $8.8bn giant whose 18 gold-coated, hexagonal plates that span the length of a tennis court and which, from bottom to top, is as tall as a three-storey building. \u201cWe\u2019ve done two decades of innovation and hard work, and this is the result,\u201d project scientist John Mather said at a press conference on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re opening up a whole new territory of astronomy.\u201d The telescope is designed to be far more powerful than Nasa\u2019s famous but aging Hubble telescope, which has for 26 years revealed auroras and supernovas, mapped the sky for dark matter, and discovered billions of stars, galaxies and planets, including those in habitable zones. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has a giant sunshield that divides the craft in two: one side facing the sun, which will power the device, and another to keep the instruments at an operating temperature of -220C, cold enough to minimize the effect of the telescope\u2019s own heat on its observations. The telescope has a primary mirror more than five times larger than Hubble\u2019s, meaning the JWST will be able to spot fainter, more distant objects. The JWST\u2019s greater power will also mean that it can see planets in greater detail, letting scientists look for atmospheres, seasons and even weather or signs of life. Mather said the telescope will have \u201cseven times the collecting area\u201d of Hubble, and enough power to detect the body heat of a bumblebee on the moon. \u201cWe\u2019d like to know if another planet out there has enough water to have an ocean, and we think we can do that,\u201d Mather said. The new telescope will have infrared instruments, to reflect and collect infrared wavelengths, meaning it can look farther back in time \u2013 at the stars and galaxies hurtling away into the expanding reaches of the universe, from where it takes light billions of years to reach the Earth. Those stars\u2019 light has stretched into wavelengths so red (\u201credshifted\u201d) it has entered the infrared spectrum, past the range of Hubble\u2019s view. The telescope will now be subjected to two years of tests before its planned launch in 2018. Unlike Hubble, it will be sent far from where astronauts could repair it, and Nasa said it will first test the JWST for the \u201cviolent sound and vibration environments\u201d of a rocket launch, including tests of forces 10 times stronger than gravity and blasts of sound to mimic rocket explosions. Then they will test for the conditions the JWST will face during two weeks of delicate unfurling in space and years in orbit. In February, the scientists will send it to a chamber at the Johnson Space Center that can be lowered to -220C (about -370F), and Bolden said it is designed to survive collisions with space debris and small holes in its mirrors, and that the telescope will need six months in space before it\u2019s ready for work. He added that scientists need to \u201cget it right here on the ground\u201d to avoid finding, \u201cas we did with Hubble, that we don\u2019t have the ability to do what we thought it was going to be able to do\u201d. The JWST was originally meant to launch in 2014, but the project was nearly canceled by Congress in 2011 due to delays and budget problems. \u201cOur lessons learned from the Hubble were, if you really care about something, you\u2019ve got to measure it at least twice,\u201d Mather added, alluding to repairs astronauts had to make after launch. Bolden said the telescope will help scientists see stars and planets from the earliest epoch of the universe. \u201cNasa has always sought to unravel the mysteries of our universe; to find out where we come from, where we are going, and whether we are alone in the universe,\u201d he said in a later statement. \u201cWe are building the James Webb Space Telescope to answer these age-old questions.\u201d"
"14||HBO cancels Bill Simmons talk show Any Given WednesdayAny Given Wednesday, Bill Simmons\u2019 weekly HBO talk show, is ending after barely four months on the air. HBO announced on Friday that the show will finish before the end of the season. The network said in a press release: \u201cAny Given Wednesday will finish its run on Wednesday November 9 and will not return to the network next season.\u201d Simmons accepted responsibility for the show\u2019s failure. He said: \u201cOne of the many reasons I joined HBO was to see if we could create a show built around smart conversations for sports fans and pop culture junkies. \u201cWe loved making that show, but unfortunately it never resonated with audiences like we hoped.

With that said, I want to thank the dedicated staff that worked so diligently with me behind the scenes to make this show every week \u2013 we hired so many great and talented people and I loved having them in my life. It\u2019s difficult for me to imagine not working with them any more.\u201d Simmons, who spent 14 years with ESPN and founded Grantland in 2011, joined HBO in July 2015 on what was reputed to be a $20m, three-year deal.

HBO Sports insisted it would remain in business with Simmons. \u201cHBO is committed to Bill Simmons, and we are excited to bring his unique vision to bear on an array of new programming initiatives under the HBO Sports banner in 2017,\u201d added Peter Nelson of HBO Sports. \u201cBill is an award-winning executive producer in the documentary arena, and we will work closely with him in developing new and engaging content for our subscribers.\u201d In the past year Simmons has launched the Ringer website and a podcast network in addition to his HBO series."
"10||Older teenagers 'quicker to improve maths and reasoning skills'Older teenagers and young adults are able to improve their fundamental maths skills and reasoning abilities more rapidly than younger teens, according to research that overturns longstanding assumptions about children\u2019s learning. The research, published by academics from University College London\u2019s Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, also upends ideas that tests used in grammar school selection can be made \u201ctutor-proof\u201d to assess potential. In particular, the research found that older adolescents significantly improved their performance in maths skills after training \u2013 suggesting that older teenagers could reveal further potential even after sitting GCSE exams at the age of 16. \u201cWe find that these cognitive skills, which are related to mathematics performance, show greater training effects in late adolescence than earlier in adolescence,\u201d said Lisa Knoll, one of the authors of the research. \u201cThese findings highlight the relevance of this late developmental stage for education and challenge the assumption that earlier is always better for learning. We find that fundamental cognitive skills related to mathematics can be significantly trained in late adolescence.\u201d The research \u2013 the first of its kind to compare the effects of training between age groups \u2013 gave tests in one of three formats to more than 600 children, teenagers and adults aged 11 to 33. After completing 20 days of training through brief online sessions, they were retested to measure improvement. While one of the three formats \u2013 face recognition \u2013 showed no improvement after training, the other two tests, of non-verbal reasoning and number judgments, showed distinct differences between age groups, with those at the older end of the age scale developing more rapidly after training. The tests were repeated six months later and showed little difference in outcome. The non-verbal reasoning test involved looking at a grid of shapes, with the final square left blank. Participants had to choose the correct shape to complete the pattern, and the shapes could vary by colour, size, shape and position. In another test, described as \u201cnumerosity discrimination\u201d, participants were shown two groups of different coloured dots in quick succession and had to judge which group had the most dots. Prof Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, senior author of the study, said that while older teens did better following training in non-verbal reasoning, the tests showed that younger teens aged 11-13 could also advance rapidly after being given brief online training sessions for three weeks. \u201cThis calls into question the claim that entry tests for selective schools that include non-verbal reasoning [can] assess the true potential of every child,\u201d Blakemore said. In the recent debate over the revival of grammar schools, supporters have claimed that \u201ctutor-proof\u201d tests using non-verbal reasoning could be used to judge academic potential in 11 year-olds. The claim has been challenged by experts including Prof Robert Coe at Durham University, who argues that all such tests are vulnerable to coaching. The UCL paper, published in the journal Psychological Science, concludes that \u201ccomplex cognitive skills relevant to maths education, particularly relational reasoning, show larger training effects in late adolescence than earlier in adolescence\u201d. It notes: \u201cThe fact that relational reasoning can be trained in all age groups tested here, and is particularly amenable to training in late adolescence, does not support the notion that matrix reasoning gives an indication of some kind of innate, fixed ability. This has implications for education because matrix reasoning is commonly used in IQ tests and school entrance exams.\u201d"
"5||Trump and Clinton visit battleground states as election day loomsDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton blitzed five battleground states between them on Friday, with four days remaining until American voters will choose their next president. Clinton began the day with a rally in Pennsylvania, a state where she holds a consistent lead over Trump, while the Republican nominee made a last-minute push in New Hampshire. Trump has surged in recent days in the Granite State, where he scored his first victory of the Republican primary contest earlier this year. Clinton\u2019s long-held lead in New Hampshire has collapsed in recent days. She was shown trailing Trump or tied with him in four new public polls taken in the wake of the letter from the FBI director, James Comey, informing Congress that it was possible new emails had been discovered related to the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. The news has helped ensure that a number of Republicans and libertarians previously skeptical about Trump have now rallied around the nominee. Former New Hampshire governor John Sununu predicted before Trump appeared there on Friday that the margin for the winning candidate could come down to 5,000 votes. Clinton\u2019s campaign announced that she would hold a rally in Manchester on Sunday, in a sign of the state\u2019s renewed competitiveness in the final stretch. Barack Obama will campaign in the state on Clinton\u2019s behalf the day before the election. Although New Hampshire only provides four electoral votes, a win there would greatly aid Trump as he navigates a narrow path to victory. Trump needs to win Ohio, Florida and North Carolina to keep close to Clinton in the electoral college. Then, he either needs to win Pennsylvania or a political grab bag that includes New Hampshire, as well as Nevada and the one electoral vote of Maine\u2019s second congressional district. Trump faced another bad news cycle on Friday, however, after two close aides of Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, a vocal Trump surrogate, were convicted in the so-called Bridgegate trial over the closure of several access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in 2013 for political reasons. Christie is leading Trump\u2019s transition team and is scheduled to campaign for the Republican nominee on Saturday. Clinton embarked on a packed itinerary on Friday, with plans to hit three key states in one day. The Democratic nominee held a rally in Pittsburgh, where thousands formed a line that snaked around the stadium of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the city\u2019s football team. She was introduced there by Mark Cuban, the influential businessman and investor who hails from Pittsburgh and has been a prominent backer of Clinton\u2019s. Cuban has repeatedly taunted Trump while stumping for Clinton, and continued to take shots at the Republican nominee in his remarks on Friday. \u201cYou cannot be president of the United States if you don\u2019t know when to shut up,\u201d Cuban said. He then led a call and response with the crowd, posing questions of Trump that ranged from his trustworthiness to his wealth. \u201cDo you think he cares more about you or his bank account?\u201d Cuban said. \u201cBank account!\u201d they shouted back. Upon taking the stage to a raucous crowd, Clinton sought to contrast her economic agenda with that of Trump. Casting him as someone who neither possessed the leadership to steer the economy nor empathy for the working class, Clinton highlighted Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns as revealing of his character. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know how he lives with himself,\u201d she said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he see the millions of women and families struggling?\u201d She also struck familiar themes about her opponent stiffing his own workers while touting her plans to introduce 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, enact equal pay for women, raise the minimum wage and expand access to affordable childcare. Clinton\u2019s closing argument was not simply policy-driven, however, leaning heavily on Trump\u2019s volatile persona and what that would mean for the country under his stewardship. \u201cThink about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him,\u201d Clinton said, prompting audience members to break into shouts of \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cImagine how easily it could be that Donald Trump would feel insulted and start a real war, not just a Twitter war, at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d From Pittsburgh, she was scheduled to move on to Detroit and Cleveland, the latter of which was billed as a get out the vote concert with rapper Jay Z. Aides aboard Clinton\u2019s press plane played down rumors that Beyonc\u00e9 would join her husband at the event, saying only there would be special guests. Clinton was accompanied on Friday by a heavier staff presence, with at least eight top aides spotted boarding her plane. Before takeoff from her home of Westchester, New York, where Clinton typically stays overnight, she chatted toward the front of the plane with digital director Teddy Goff and policy director Maya Harris. Speechwriter Dan Schwerin was also on hand, as were campaign chairman John Podesta and Capricia Marshall, who served as the chief of protocol when Clinton led the state department. Clinton\u2019s campaign underscored the importance of early voting returns in a conference call with reporters on Friday afternoon. They pointed in particular to turnout among Latino voters in the must-win state of Florida, stating it had risen 120% from 2012. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, also noted a 90% increase in Asian American voters overall. Turnout among minorities disproportionately benefits Democrats, as such demographics have increasingly been marginalized by Republicans in recent election cycles. In Pittsburgh, Clinton said the country was \u201con track right now to have the biggest turnout in American history\u201d. But she urged her supporters not to take anything for granted. For those who knew someone considering voting for Trump, she warned, \u201cPlease stage an intervention.\u201d After his stop in New Hampshire, Trump was due to hit Wilmington, Ohio, and Hershey, Pennsylvania, later on Friday. On Saturday both candidates will head south to Florida \u2013 the ultimate swing state that Trump at least must win if he wants the keys to the White House. Trump will hit North Carolina and Nevada, too, while Clinton will head back to Philadelphia for another star-studded concert \u2013 this time with Katy Perry in Philadelphia."
"15||#SavePepe: cartoon frog's creator tries to take meme back from alt-rightHow could you reclaim a meme that\u2019s been appropriated by white supremacists? That\u2019s the challenge faced by Pepe the Frog\u2019s creator Matt Furie. Furie has launched the #SavePepe campaign in an attempt to transform the cartoon frog from a symbol of hate used by racist Donald Trump supporters to a symbol of peace. He\u2019s urging people to flood the internet with their own \u201cpeaceful or nice\u201d versions of Pepe to claw the character back from the alt-right. \u201cWe are in uncharted territory right now,\u201d said Furie, an artist and author of children\u2019s books as well as a Hillary Clinton supporter, \u201cBut I have to take some responsibility for him because he\u2019s like my kid or something.\u201d Furie created Pepe back in 2005 as one of four anthropomorphic characters in a comic book called Boy\u2019s Club to amuse his friends at work. \u201cThe frog was just a chilled-out frog who likes to eat snacks and talk on the phone, smoke weed,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the characters are an extension of different parts of my personality, but particularly Pepe. He has these heavy eyelids and laid-back nature that I think I have.\u201d Pepe first became a meme in around 2008. People were lifting frames from the comic book, particularly one where Pepe has pulled his pants all the way down to pee and says \u201cfeels good, man\u201d and another where Pepe is consoling himself about his lack of success with women, saying \u201cat least I have time for a pizza on a bagel\u201d and adding their own captions. \u201cThen the Sad Frog took off,\u201d said Furie, referencing a meme that flipped \u201cfeels good man\u201d on its head. \u201cIt just started to have a life of its own. All these versions of Pepe having different personalities \u2013 smug, sad or really violent and weird,\u201d said Furie, citing a \u201cscatological and weirdly graphic\u201d version known as Poo Poo Pee Pee Pepe [NSFW]. Pepe\u2019s success was international, and he won major followings in China and Korea. \u201cPepe transcends all these kind of sociological boundaries. He\u2019s just a cartoon frog that\u2019s sad and people can relate to that.\u201d That all changed on 12 September, when Hillary Clinton posted an explainer about Pepe the Frog becoming a racist hate symbol. Over the previous few weeks, Pepe had been appropriated by the alt-right and was being used as a mascot for white supremacy by some Trump supporters. Two weeks later, Pepe was added to the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s database of hate symbols, joining the swastika, the triangular Klan symbol and other iconography associated with racism. Pepe\u2019s face is a common profile icon for Trump supporters on Twitter. Furie acknowledges that he lost control of Pepe the day he became a meme. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter who creates the meme. It becomes an internet thing.\u201d However, when ADL credited him as the creator of Pepe, he realized he had to intervene. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst-case scenario for any artist to lose control of their work and eventually have it labelled like a swastika or a burning cross,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to step up and speak on the cartoon frog\u2019s behalf.\u201d Furie has collected about 600 positive or peaceful frog memes being generated by the #SavePepe campaign. He plans to incorporate these into what he calls a \u201cPeace Pepe Database of Love\u201d, an online resource for people who want to support his campaign to cement Pepe\u2019s reputation as a \u201cstoned, chilled frog\u201d. \u201cI would like to get the frog off the hate database. It means a lot to me as he\u2019s an extension of myself.\u201d"
"16||Marina Abramovi\u0107 mention in Podesta emails sparks accusations of satanismPerformance artist Marina Abramovi\u0107 has become an unlikely source of fear for rightwing groups after her name was mentioned in the Podesta emails. In a leaked email between Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, and his brother Tony Podesta, an invitation from Abramovi\u0107 is forwarded. It reads: \u201cI am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining?\u201d The act of spirit cooking involves Abramovi\u0107 using pig\u2019s blood as a way of connecting with the spiritual world, to cook up thoughts rather than food. A video of the practice shows her writing various statements with the blood, such as \u201cwith a sharp knife cut deeply into your middle finger eat the pain\u201d. Abramovi\u0107 is known, and lauded, for work that focuses on pain, blood and the relationship between the performer and the audience. Her work has won many awards, including the Golden Lion at Venice. The email has caused shock within some Republican circles, with Alex Jones\u2019s news site Infowars calling it \u201cone of the most disturbing WikiLeaks revelations to date\u201d, as well as stating \u201creports that FBI agents see Hillary Clinton as \u2018the antichrist personified\u2019 now make a lot more sense\u201d. On Twitter, #SpiritCooking was the top trend on Friday morning. Republican author Mark Dice tweeted: \u201cI am now accepting apologies from everyone who said I was crazy for writing books about how the Establishment are Satanists\u201d. While another tweet, shared over 1,000 times compared her to the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. Abramovi\u0107 spoke about the reaction today to Artnews. \u201cI\u2019m outraged, because this is taken completely out of my context,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just a normal dinner. It was actually just a normal menu, which I call spirit cooking. There was no blood, no anything else. We just call things funny names, that\u2019s all.\u201d She also claimed that those referring to her body of work as satanic are mistaken. \u201cMy work is really more about spirituality and not anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my work for so long, and this is a misunderstanding. It\u2019s absolutely outrageous and ridiculous \u2026 I mean, this world is really turning to hell. I am completely amazed, something is taken out of context for the purpose of winning. We are living in such a strange world.\u201d"
"8||It\u2019s winner takes all on Brexit island, because the audience demands itLike so many of the biggest formats in the golden era of reality TV, Brexit is set on an island. Back in the early years of the millennium, you were nothing in unscripted programming unless you were marooned on an island or in a McMansion, then forced to fight your way to the prize by scheming, screaming, demeaning, and not forgetting the lyrics to Dance with My Father. The transatlantic spirit of the age was Simon Cowell, a populist whose love of plebiscites did little to disguise his totalitarian ambition. When he declared, \u201cNo one is ever going to publish a book called Simon Cowell, My Struggle\u2019\u2019, I wept for the loss of the German edition. The holy grail of reality formats was conflict, as orchestrated by cynical, unseen producers, who manipulated participants into degrading themselves and the public into voting \u2013 at financial cost \u2013 for the result. Absurd props and esoteric MacGuffins were spoken of as solemnly as if they were articles of a country\u2019s constitution. Tribal Council. The Diary Room. Bushtucker Trials. The \u00a3350m Bus . Judges\u2019 Houses. Unelected Judges\u2019 Houses. Hang on \u2013 a couple of those have ended up in the wrong list. Still, you get the idea. As any number of dystopian fictions from Rollerball to The Hunger Games have long warned us, the future is a televised contest played for the highest stakes. So we must have known the current shitshow was in the post. Either way, it turns out all those who used to tut, \u201cHow low can reality TV go?\u201d were totally asking the wrong question. Look how high it\u2019s gone! Never mind history repeating itself as farce \u2013 reality TV is repeating itself as history. On the other side of the Atlantic, arguably the biggest reality star of that golden era is currently the Republican nominee for the presidency. Over this side, to many narcotised by two decades of the genre, the uncomplicated certainties of its voting are regarded as less of a conspiracy than judicial process. With the exception of X Factor, where the hostility was more covert, reality TV voting was always disapproval voting. You voted off. You voted out. And that was that. A significant section of the population believe the EU was voted off on 23 June, and now are beginning to openly dismiss the rule of law, as though it were Jedward, or a Survivor contestant who disparaged the Ulong tribe\u2019s plans for a shelter with an awesome sex crib attached. Who does Cayla even think she is? What even is the rule of law? Who made it queen of everything? Tory MP David Davies doesn\u2019t believe in it; half the papers don\u2019t believe in it; others have already taken their lead without encouragement. Maybe the rule of law\u2019s \u201cjourney\u201d on the show has come to an end, and we should crank up Everybody Hurts and bid it farewell with a montage of its best bits. Today\u2019s Daily Express front page likened the \u201cthreat\u201d of a high court ruling on the triggering of article 50 to that of Hitler. Guys \u2013 if you hate Hitler so much, stop publishing front pages that read like future exhibits in a museum show called Before the Militias. The second most WTF-laden intro was in the Daily Mail, which assigned ark-of-the-covenant-like qualities to a leaflet whose only prior claim to fame was being dismissed as a biased disgrace in the Daily Mail. As Friday\u2019s paper had it: \u201cMPs last night accused judges of failing to read the \u00a39m taxpayer-funded publicity leaflet that stated the referendum result would be followed directly by ministers.\u201d Wait \u2013 MPs accused judges of failing to read a leaflet? Did they also accuse them of failing to follow the rules of Bootcamp? Can we settle this with an immunity task/a sing-off in the karaokosseum/ a catfight between the leaflet and the bus? Also: didn\u2019t the Daily Mail watch the shows? The mean judge is always a Brit \u2013 and in this case, there are three of them. Can\u2019t at least one of these leaflet-shunners be replaced by X Factor judge \u2013 and Brexiteer \u2013 Sharon Osbourne? Having banged on about their failure to remotely understand what they were asking for at the time, I do have to offer another slow handclap for the generation of politicians such as Gordon Brown \u2013 a man so obsessed with the X Factor that he once wrote personal letters to the finalists \u2013 who were forever on about wanting \u201can X Factor politics\u201d. Newsflash, Gordon: this is what X Factor politics looks like. Try not to choke on it! Now his ratings are on the slide, Cowell can at least take comfort that his plan to \u201cgive politics the X Factor\u201d has come to pass. \u201cThe fact we\u2019re allowing the public to make the decisions most of the time is a really good thing,\u201d Cowell once mused of his various shows. \u201cThe great thing is when you start seeing it in places like China and Afghanistan. It\u2019s democracy. We\u2019ve kinda given democracy back to the world.\u201d Man, he had it all figured out, didn\u2019t he? A bit like his best mate Philip Green \u2013 whose report into government efficiency concluded that running the vast and complex machinery of the state was akin to retail \u2013 Cowell\u2019s reputation as a man with the answer to everything is likely to oxidise rapidly. At one stage he punted the idea of a TV show where the public voted every week on a political issue \u2013 and perhaps Simon passed on this faith in frequent referendums to David Cameron, whom he backed in a major Sun splash on the eve of the 2010 election. Cameron, he reckoned, was a man of \u201csubstance\u201d with \u201cthe stomach to navigate us through difficult times\u201d. In the end, it\u2019s amazing \u2013 considering how histrionic and uncivilised many found it at the time \u2013 quite how rule-abiding and righteous reality TV now looks compared to actual reality. There were parameters on the shows, even on many of the ghastlier ones. I mean, at least soundstages were frequently equipped with lie detectors. Imagine how much better this US election would have been with a polygraph. Imagine how much better the referendum campaign would have been with a polygraph. Imagine how much better both would have been if politicians had been bleeped and called into the producers when they said something racist. Please don\u2019t take all this as the view from above. It is hardly a matter of pride, but I suspect I am as unwittingly, hopelessly addicted to the horrifyingly debased dramas of today\u2019s politics as many others. I used to watch lots of reality shows, but they haven\u2019t done it for me for years now. Maybe the hit I used to get off their dramas and conflicts \u2013 was it dopamine? \u2013 requires a bigger stimulus. In the mad fever dream of the US election and the increasingly frightening divisions of Brexit, both amplified by social media, maybe I and countless others have found it. This used to be the way we watched. Now it\u2019s the way we seek to govern; the way we govern; the way we live."
"0||In the key of zzz: the concerts intended to send you to sleepIt\u2019s just after 7pm on Thursday in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a time when restaurants and bars are just starting to buzz with activity. But inside the National Sawdust arts space, audience members are stretching out on pillows and cushions, forming two long rows. The lights go out. Antiphonal volleys of snoring become audible. It is just what the musicians had in mind. Theo Bleckmann, the experimental, genre-hopping singer, and Shai Maestro, a jazz pianist, billed their concert as a kind of \u201cmusical meditation\u201d, in which audience members should lie down, unplug, shut their eyes and immerse themselves in \u201csounds, melodies and landscapes\u201d. With the exception of several glowing red exit signs, lighting was completely extinguished and only the performers\u2019 silhouettes could be seen. One patron in a grey suit shifted awkwardly and glanced at his phone, before pulling his knees to his chest and apparently succumbing to the conceit. \u201cSometimes we have to coerce or push the audience into a new experience, or in my case, it was an old experience,\u201d Bleckmann said in a phone interview. As a teenager, the German-born singer would lie on his bedroom floor and scrutinize jazz recordings. \u201cWe don\u2019t listen to music sitting down, closing our eyes and really taking in the music any more. We\u2019re doing other things \u2013 we\u2019re checking our phones, we\u2019re watching TV. There are so many distractions.\u201d The 75-minute sequence of airy, lushly textured songs, many of which featured Bleckmann\u2019s wordless vocalizations and live electronic processing, is the latest wrinkle of an ongoing trend: concerts in utter darkness. At a time when orchestras are adding video and staging effects to generate visual interest, performers from a range of art music traditions are nurturing an opposite impulse, taking the (literal) spotlight off themselves and focusing on their audience\u2019s inner needs. This can be seen in Georg Haas\u2019s In iij. Noct (In the Dark), a knotty yet fashionable string quartet in which darkness is a compositional device; in Max Richter\u2019s \u201ceight-hour lullaby\u201d Sleep; and in a dramatic staging last month of Brahms\u2019s German Requiem at Lincoln Center\u2019s White Light Festival. For the latter performance, 60 casually dressed members of the Berlin Radio Choir traipsed amid the audience at Manhattan\u2019s Cathedral Church of St John the Divine in near total darkness. Bleckmann said he welcomed the inevitable outcomes of his experiment. \u201cIf people fall asleep, it\u2019s completely fine,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cThe first step in listening is to have your body relaxed and let your mind just wander and not be distracted by visual stimuli.\u201d Unlike Bleckmann\u2019s songs, which artfully straddled the line between introspective and narcoleptic, the string players for Haas\u2019s quartet surround the audience in a more confrontational tableau. Haas asks for complete darkness, with even emergency exit lights extinguished (ushers at some performances have been equipped with night-vision goggles and a fire marshal has stood by). Los Angeles Times music critic Mark Swed writes that he first laughed off a liability waiver he was asked to sign, but then, \u201cafter an initial thrill of enveloping darkness, got nervous\u201d. Warnings to the anxiety-prone were similarly issued at a 2013 performance at Lincoln Center\u2019s Clark Studio Theater. \u201cIt sets up a completely different dynamic for audience members,\u201d conceded Jane Moss, Lincoln Center\u2019s artistic director. \u201cIf you are in complete darkness, to a remarkable degree, you have to trust the person sitting next to you. In terms of the human wiring, that is a state of alarm. It took me 10 minutes to settle into that piece.\u201d But Moss believes that audiences develop a stronger sense of community and camaraderie during concerts in the dark, or in other physical formats that depart from the proscenium stage with a curtain. \u201cEven 20 years ago, you would buy a ticket to the great, celebrity performer and you would sit there as a rapt worshipper of this god who is performing on stage,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is audiences wanting an experience that they\u2019re a part of. It\u2019s a shift in audience orientation.\u201d These same impulses have, to varying degrees, influenced the participatory trend of immersive theater. Perhaps not to be outdone, Lera Auerbach\u2019s 2013 opera The Blind calls on attendees to be blindfolded and led into the hall as gusts of cold air rush through the auditorium. Next month, the Brooklyn Academy of Music will present a sensorial concert of Debussy\u2019s String Quartet, in which blindfolded patrons are fed and exposed to various scents. But the largest subcategory involves sleep-themed music. Richter\u2019s Sleep, for piano, strings and vocals, which received its premiere in London in September 2015, has drawn attention not just for aiding sleep but interpreting the act into art. But as Victoria Williamson, the director of music and wellbeing at the University of Sheffield observes, such pieces can\u2019t be universally prescribed. \u201cIf we say, \u2018this is the perfect music for sleep,\u2019 and you put it on and say \u2018I don\u2019t like that,\u2019 that\u2019s a really strong barrier,\u201d she said. \u201cSo much of our response to music is based on aesthetics and you can\u2019t divorce it from that.\u201d Spotify currently hosts 1.9m user playlists titled \u201csleep\u201d, topped by Peaceful Piano, with 2.1 million followers. Pandora offers channels such as Spa and Relaxation, which range from new age massage-table music to mellow singer-songwriters. There are even music-playing pillows and \u201csleep-tainment\u201d options on Netflix. But as concert presenters aim to soothe frazzled urbanites, research is still ongoing. The Cochrane Report, a meta-analysis of major music studies, reported last year that while there is some evidence to suggest that music may help treat insomnia, \u201cmore high-quality research is needed\u201d. Bleckmann says that while he enjoys listening to music late at night, he won\u2019t use it as a sleep aid. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep if I know an electronic thing is running,\u201d he said. That would give me insomnia. I\u2019m too neurotic.\u201d"
"11||Florida measure calls itself pro-solar but critics say it's 'a wolf in sheep's clothing'Climate change may have been largely ignored during the presidential election but it will be on the ballot on 8 November, with Florida voters deciding on a measure backed by large utilities that could effectively snuff out the solar industry in the state. The measure, known as amendment 1, has been criticized as \u201cfundamentally dishonest\u201d for superficially appearing to be pro-solar. However, renewable energy experts warn that it would remove the incentive for homeowners to get rooftop solar panels, devastating the solar industry in America\u2019s sunshine state. The amendment would change Florida\u2019s constitution to give consumers the right to have solar panels installed. But it also states that the government should \u201censure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do\u201d. A group called Consumers for Smart Solar, backed by more than $20m in campaign funding by Florida\u2019s large energy utilities, has put forward the measure, ostensibly to protect Florida residents from rip-offs. But critics contend that the proposal would lead the way to solar panel owners facing fees or a reduced price for the excess energy they put back into the grid, known as net metering. \u201cThe utilities have been fundamentally dishonest, their behavior is incredibly cynical,\u201d said David Pomerantz, executive director of pro-renewables group Energy and Policy Institute. \u201cIt has confused quite a few voters and that was by design. The large electric utilities in Florida feel extraordinarily threatened by customer-owned solar. Instead of trying to adapt to it, they want to kill rooftop solar in the cradle.\u201d Pomerantz said the measure would be a major blow to a solar industry that is already \u201cstunted\u201d in Florida. Fewer than 20,000 Floridian homes have solar panels, despite its enormous potential for solar energy, compared with Massachusetts, a north-east state with a quarter of the population, which has 163,000 homes with solar panels. The dismantling of net metering, one of the few incentives to get solar in Florida, could have a similar outcome as that seen in Nevada, where increased charges and reduced net metering credits saw leading solar panel installer SolarCity pull out of the state. Environmentalists have rounded on the Florida measure, with former vice-president Al Gore accusing the utilities of \u201ctrying to fool you\u201d into killing off the solar industry. A court challenge to stop the measure was defeated in the Florida supreme court but Justice Barbara Pariente, in dissent, called the amendment a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d and an attempt to \u201cconstitutionalize the status quo\u201d. Polling has shown strong support for amendment 1, although support has recently plummeted to close to the 60% threshold needed for the proposition to pass. The drop in support followed the Miami Herald\u2019s release in October of an audio recording by Sal Nuzzo, vice-president of free market group James Madison Institute. Nuzzo told an industry conference that amendment 1 was an \u201cincredibly savvy maneuver\u201d and \u201cpolitical jiujitsu\u201d that would \u201ccompletely negate anything (pro-solar groups) would try to do legislatively or constitutionally down the road\u201d. Consumers for Smart Solar, the utilities-backed group, has denied any connection to the Hames Madison Institute and insisted that the amendment would protect consumers from scams and from subsidizing solar companies from outside Florida. \u201cAmendment 1 is good for the environment, it is good for consumers and it is good for Florida,\u201d said Dick Batchelor, co-chair of Consumers for Smart Solar. \u201cHowever, in looking at ways to increase the amount of our energy that comes from the sun, it is essential that we do so in a way that safeguards consumers \u2013 particularly our seniors \u2013 with commonsense consumer protection rules that benefit every consumer, and that we have all come to expect.\u201d The Florida solar measure isn\u2019t the only climate-related item voters will decide on on Tuesday. Voters in Washington will decide whether the state will be the first in the US to introduce a carbon tax on emissions. The measure, called I-732, would place a $25-per-ton fee on carbon dioxide emissions from 2018, rising gradually over the course of 40 years to $100. It will aim to be revenue neutral, however, because Washington\u2019s sales tax will be cut by 1% and further tax rebated will be given to manufacturers and low-income households. The vote has split environment groups, some of which supported an alternative that would have raised money to be funneled into clean energy projects. The Sierra Club has said it doesn\u2019t support I-732 because it \u201cdoes not include all that is needed for an equitable climate policy and just transition to a clean energy economy\u201d, in particular by failing to support communities of color and low income. The projections put forward by Carbon Washington, the grassroots group behind the measure, have also been questioned. An analysis by the Washington Office of Financial Management found that the measure will cut the state\u2019s revenue by $200m a year. However, the measure does retain some notable support, including former Nasa scientist James Hansen, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Steven Chu, former secretary of energy under Barack Obama. An open letter penned by 51 climate scientists also backs I-732. \u201cThis revenue neutral measure offers the most progressive change in our tax code in decades and represents a bipartisan effort that rejects ideology,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWhile many interrelated social and environmental needs demand our attention, complex problems are best solved one step at a time. I-732 is a simple step in the right direction.\u201d"
"8||If Donald Trump wins, it\u2019ll be a new age of darknessWe are standing on the brink of the abyss. And, like anyone who\u2019s ever peered into a chasm, we are experiencing a queasy, sinking feeling. All round the world, not just in the United States, people are contemplating the prospect that on Wednesday morning we will wake to hear of victory for Donald J Trump. The mere imagining of that outcome is inducing anxiety in those far away from the action. I don\u2019t just mean obsessives such as me, who spend the midnight hour checking the early voting returns from Washoe County, Nevada. Otherwise normal people also confess to being reduced to nervous wrecks by the thought that Trump might actually win. They chart their mood swings on social media, delighting in hopeful news \u2013 Hillary Clinton up in ABC News tracking poll! \u2013 or panicking at any sign the snake-oil salesman might pull it off, such as today\u2019s Washington Post headline: \u201cDonald Trump has never been closer to the presidency than he is at this moment\u201d, I could feel my palms turn clammy. In Britain we feel especially vulnerable. If you voted remain, the memory of a ballot going the wrong way is fresh. And not just any ballot, but one you believe will cause lasting, epochal damage. The thought that Tuesday might bring the second such moment in a year is one to dread. Thanks to Brexit, the usual reassurances \u2013 the expert endorsements, the polling data \u2013 have lost their calming properties. In June the smart money, including the betting markets, said remain had it in the bag. Burnt by that experience, nothing can soothe us now \u2013 except the right result. Until then, we have to chew our fingernails, hit refresh on the Real Clear Politics polling page and wait. Many, especially in the US, will have a ready response: what\u2019s it got to do with you? To which the answer is: plenty. The experience of the last photo-finish election \u2013 Bush v Gore in 2000 \u2013 taught many non-Americans a lesson we could not forget. Americans decide, but their decision affects the entire world. The supreme court\u2019s installation of George W Bush as president had a profound and global impact. Just over a year later, Bush was agitating to invade Iraq, a choice whose consequences we live with still. (In Britain the focus is always on Tony Blair, as it was again this week when John Chilcot faced MPs. But that war would never have happened without Bush.) So a President Trump will change lives far beyond the US. An American leader who believes climate change is a Chinese hoax, who believes terror suspects should be tortured and their family members killed, who believes that Saudi Arabia should have nuclear weapons, who is fascinated by nukes\u2019 power of \u201cdevastation\u201d and who has asked repeatedly why the US doesn\u2019t use them; a man who says, \u201cI love war\u201d; a man who drools in admiration for Vladimir Putin and whose disregard for Nato, and refusal to promise to defend a member state if attacked, would all but invite Moscow to invade one of the Baltic states \u2013 such a man would plunge all of us into a dark future. That we are not living in the US will not protect us. But his impact will be felt \u2013 is perhaps already being felt \u2013 in a more subtle way too. For like it or not, the US and Britain breathe some of the same air. Their politics rubs off on us. (This year, unusually, it\u2019s worked the other way around too: Trump invokes Brexit daily.) So a Trump presidency would exert a pull beyond America\u2019s shores. Suspicion of migrants, loathing of Muslims, a desire to put up walls and roll back social progress \u2013 these currents exist everywhere. Were Trump to win, they would have the endorsement of the most powerful office in the world. For eight years, Barack Obama has been a cautionary voice, counselling against the global rush towards xenophobia and insularity. If Trump replaces him, white nationalism will have command of the world\u2019s loudest megaphone. Racists and bigots everywhere will feel validated, vindicated \u2013 and mobilised. The same is true of the contempt Trump shows for basic democratic norms. As much as the rank prejudice, it\u2019s this that has serious people \u2013 including Republicans \u2013 fearing they are witness to something akin to fascism. His insistence that \u201cI alone can fix\u201d America\u2019s problems; his threats to curb the free press, punishing news organisations that have criticised him; his hint that he would sack America\u2019s generals and replace them with ones more compliant; his threats to jail his opponent and his winking hint that gun rights activists could find a way to deal with Clinton; his refusal to say he will accept the outcome of the election \u2013 with each of these steps, Trump has trampled on the foundation stones of liberal democracy. Should he win, it would be a victory for a candidate who has lied more than any in history, who is spectacularly unqualified for the job and who stands contrary to the very idea of expertise. (Asked who he consulted on foreign policy, Trump answered, \u201cI\u2019m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I\u2019ve said a lot of things.\u201d) It would be a triumph over truth, facts and knowledge. It would be the start of a new age of endarkenment. It sounds extreme, it sounds far-fetched. But that\u2019s because we assume that stability, even the civilised order, are somehow the natural way of things, almost impossible to upend. But that\u2019s not how it is. Civilisation is frail. The balances and restraints that hold us in check are delicate: they took many centuries to construct but would take only moments to smash. They rely on goodwill, trust and co-operation more than we realise. Take those things away, and darkness beckons. In Britain, we are not smugly distant from this. Our own democratic system rests on respect for the rule of law and the judges who enforce it. Yet, even here a national newspaper can brand three senior judges \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, citing the fact that one of them is \u201copenly gay\u201d as evidence that their legal judgment was rigged and illegitimate. This is Trumpism \u2013 he too attacks judges who won\u2019t surrender to him \u2013 and it is a virus not confined to the US. Full of hatred towards anyone deemed an outsider, contemptuous of knowledge and red-faced with self-righteous fury at a nebulous, all-encompassing elite, it is becoming the movement of our times. The first step towards its defeat is denying it a victory on Tuesday. Across the globe, we have to hope that happens \u2013 and that Americans end this nightmare before it can begin."
"17||Google pays \u20ac47m in tax in Ireland on \u20ac22bn sales revenueGoogle\u2019s controversial advertising sales business in Dublin earned revenues of \u20ac22.6bn (\u00a320.1bn) from Europe, the Middle East and Africa last year but paid just \u20ac47.8m in tax, according to company filings in Ireland. Revenues at Google Ireland Limited rose 23% in 2015, to \u20ac22.6bn, and were equivalent to a third of the search group\u2019s global income. Of this Irish income, more than $7bn (\u00a35.6bn) is thought to have come from transactions with advertisers in the UK. Google has continued to route its sales from British advertisers through Ireland, despite efforts by the former UK chancellor George Osborne to crack down on multinational tech groups that \u201cabused the trust of the British people\u201d. Google Ireland Limited is one half of the search group\u2019s so-called \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax structure. Although Google reported booming revenues, its taxable profits were only \u20ac341m. This profit figure was small in large part because the company had to meet administrative expenses of \u20ac16.9bn. These expenses are thought to be dominated by royalty fees paid to other Google subsidiaries \u2013 income which eventually makes its way to a business called Google Holdings Ireland, the second company in Google\u2019s \u201cdouble Irish\u201d structure. Almost no information is made public about Google Holdings Ireland, which is an unlimited company. It is registered to the address of a law firm in Dublin, but is thought to pay no tax in Ireland as it is tax-resident in Bermuda. Because it is unlimited, Google Holdings Ireland is not required to file accounts, under Irish company law. However, Bermuda does not charge corporation tax, so the billions of dollars of income Google is able to move into Google Holdings Ireland each year go untaxed. Google has told investors that, at the end of last year, it had amassed an offshore cash pile of $42.9bn. Other US tech companies that have made use of \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax avoidance structures include Facebook, Microsoft and Apple. Under pressure from world leaders, Ireland agreed two years ago to start phasing out the tax benefits of such structures. However, Irish ministers have awarded generous \u201cgrandfathering rights\u201d which ensure Google and others are able to pour income into their offshore tax havens up until 2020. Google, which is ultimately owned by the holding company Alphabet Inc, insists it\u2019s business in Ireland are much more than a tax structure. At the end of last year, Google Ireland Limited employed 2,763 staff, an increase of 6% in 12 months. \u201cAs Google grows, Ireland continues to benefit,\u201d said Ronan Harris, who is shortly moving from Ireland to lead Google operations in the UK. \u201cIn 2015 we opened our second data centre, bringing total investment in capital assets in Ireland to over \u20ac750m.\u201d Ahead of the UK election in 2015, George Osborne promised to stop tech firms routing sales from customers in Britain to gateway jurisdictions, such as Ireland or Luxembourg, from where income can then be easily transferred to offshore tax havens. As UK chancellor, Osborne introduced a new punitive tax, known as the diverted profits tax, which he said would hit companies found to be artificially shifting UK income overseas. It later emerged, however, that while some companies, such as Amazon and Facebook, said they would change their ways, others \u2013 including Google and eBay \u2013 have continued to book UK sales overseas. In January, UK tax inspectors reached a \u00a3130m tax settlement with Google over taxes stretching back 10 years. Osborne initially heralded as a \u201cmajor success\u201d, though many others condemned it as too lenient. Separately, Google has promised significant investment in the UK, which some tax campaigners fear may have been a factor in the minds of those at HMRC reaching the settlement. A more serious challenge to the \u201cdouble Irish\u201d tax avoidance method \u2013 or at least the most significant instance of it \u2013 came from European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. In August she ruled that Apple\u2019s long-standing tax arrangements in Ireland relied on illegal state aid. As a result, the Irish government would have to collect \u20ac13bn in back taxes from the iPhone maker, she said."
"8||The Guardian view on the US election: Hillary Clinton is the world\u2019s best hopeThe US election matters as much to the world as it does to Americans. The overriding reason is that an immense and present danger hangs over multilateralism and the notion of a rules-based global order. A Donald Trump victory would immediately make the world more worrying and unsettled than it already is. The US may no longer be seen as the world hegemon, whether benign or threatening, but it is still the single most important power. Its behaviour has unique potential to either make solutions possible or to add to areas of chaos. A Trump presidency would be bad for the US and dangerous for the world. A vote for Hillary Clinton is the most effective way of preventing it. Domestic politics and the clash of personalities have dominated this campaign. But the little that Mr Trump has said is enough to know where the foreign policy risks and promises lie in the 8 November vote. A Trump victory would severely damage US standing almost everywhere. His strongman antics are a liability, not an asset. They are as distressing as they are ridiculous. Believing a man-to-man approach with Vladimir Putin will instantly dissolve Russia\u2019s aggressive revisionism reflects more ignorance than it does bravado. Mrs Clinton has a reputation for a hawkish outlook, but this will be tempered by war-weary public opinion in the US. She recognises that in the 21st century, US power has more chances of attaining goals if it acts inclusively, and not with go-it-alone reckless tactics. She has already applied much of this as secretary of state \u2013 playing a key role in the historic deal with Iran, in pushing a new relationship with Cuba and managing the complex US relationship with China. A Clinton presidency should rely on soft power in a smart way, a philosophy she touched upon in her Democratic convention speech this summer. She should pay close attention to climate change, development and working out fairer global trade arrangements. The US should also take the lead on international justice by signing up to the international criminal court \u2013 and Mrs Clinton has expressed \u201cgreat regret\u201d about Washington\u2019s refusal to join. There are questions that Mrs Clinton\u2019s team, should they enter the White House, need to resolve. She\u2019s revealed precious little of what she\u2019d do about Afghanistan, a 14-year war that president Obama pledged to end, but that is still grinding on. If she sits behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office she will have to work out what to do with the dozens of inmates remaining in Guantanamo Bay. When she talks of an intelligence surge, there are concerns about what this means for the spying powers of the National Security Agency. Mrs Clinton is a politician with the experience to tackle these matters. Mr Trump is not. He is more interested in pandering to dictators than in holding them accountable for crimes. He\u2019s spoken in favour of torture. His approach to trade is in line with his approach to immigration \u2013 the building of walls. He has portrayed global warming as a hoax. Mrs Clinton can be trusted with the nuclear button. Mr Trump cannot. A Trump presidency would be a leap into the unknown. His bigotry, his love of weapons, his impulsiveness and his America first-ism are all dangers. His victory would likely lead to more, not less, global confrontation. The most pressing issues are the burning crises of the Middle East. These will continue to hinder a US \u201crebalancing\u201d to Asia. There are no easy answers here. Mrs Clinton may want to put as much emphasis on protecting civilians as on combating Isis \u2013 she has spoken of creating a no-fly zone in Syria, a proposal that carries too much risk. She will have to search for better leverage in the region; heftier diplomacy that perhaps includes coercion through sanctions. For Europe the stakes are high. Mrs Clinton is concerned about the old continent\u2019s prospects. Mr Trump plays on American isolationism \u2013 he supported Brexit and cares little for transatlantic security guarantees. Russian muscle-flexing means that, whoever becomes president, European nations can no longer rely on the US to do all the heavy lifting. Global governance is under increased strain. Geopolitical competition is rife. US leadership has a key role to play. Mrs Clinton helped turn the page on the disastrous George W Bush era. The diplomatic accomplishments of the past eight years should not be minimised. Neither Mr Bush nor Mr Obama could have anticipated the crises that befell them once they reached office. How a president reacts matters greatly. On this count alone Mrs Clinton deserves to be elected."
"4||The challenge for the W-League this season is to keep the hype aliveHeading into the new season, there is a palpable sense of anticipation among us players, but also a feeling of great responsibility. As stakeholders in the game, it\u2019s up to us to continue the momentum that has built during the off-season and justify the fanfare which is heralding this new campaign. Women\u2019s football finds itself well positioned in the Australian sporting landscape on the eve of the 2016-17 season. The new pay deal struck by Professional Footballers Australia feels like a real breakthrough moment \u2013 every player needs to be recognised as a professional and needs to get paid. It\u2019s a small step but, significantly, one in the right direction. We have to develop our game, not only as footballers but also as women\u2019s footballers. The coming years are crucial and we need to really push on from where we are now. It\u2019s pointless if we fight for all this, only then to ease off the accelerator. As a senior player, I do feel a responsibility to advance our cause and as someone who\u2019s been in the game for a number of years, I\u2019m in a good position to do so. A lot of the girls enjoy strong relationships, so it\u2019s quite easy to talk to them and get them on the same page. We\u2019re seeing right now quite a number of girls getting involved with PFA to try to help build the game. It\u2019s exciting to see the advances made with the new AFL league coming along, and the success of netball and cricket leagues, but I still see football as the No1 women\u2019s sport in Australia. Maybe I\u2019m biased, but I believe it\u2019s is at the forefront of the women\u2019s sport push, even though every sport has a part to play in keeping the others on their toes and constantly pushing their competitors to raise the bar. You don\u2019t need to look much beyond my new club, Melbourne City to see how far we\u2019ve come. City really are the standard bearers at the moment and the benchmark others should aspire to \u2013 both on and off the pitch. I\u2019ve only arrived at the club three weeks ago but immediately I was struck by the level of professionalism here. We all heard what the club was like last year, but being here now I can see it for myself. The facilities are in line with the men\u2019s team \u2013 we have our own changeroom, lockers, physio and medical space. We share a gym with the men and we have access to the training fields they have \u2013 everything they have access to, we do too. Even my move here was handled impeccably. My room in the house was ready as soon as I arrived from overseas, all my stuff was already there, team outfits, everything. The transition from one team to another \u2013 from one country to another \u2013 has been incredibly smooth and the club have made it easy for me to settle in. It\u2019s testament to how the club is run, their operation in general, how much they want to develop the women\u2019s game, and how far it has come in a relatively short space of time. Yet I\u2019m still not satisfied with what we\u2019ve achieved so far and want to see even more progress being made over the next couple of years. The next big step is for the W-League to go fully professional, with more games and a longer season. I\u2019d also love to see the Matildas playing more frequently and getting to a stage where we\u2019re selling out stadiums. The media has a crucial role to play in making that a reality. At the moment, coverage in mainstream media is OK, even great during big events such as the World Cup and the Olympics, but the domestic game is filled with rich stories that currently aren\u2019t being told. Every player has a history, and would be a shame not to share \u2013 and celebrate \u2013 that. It\u2019s all part of what I see as the number one priority this season: ensuring we ride the crest of this wave and keep the hype alive."
"4||Football\u2019s invisibles: the long and lonely road from calamitous injuryWith so many headlines devoted to English football\u2019s uniquely tedious interpretation of this year\u2019s opium wars, the latest potholes encountered by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho on his road to managerial perdition and the apparently interminable hoopla surrounding West Ham\u2019s new digs in east London, it was easy to miss the news that Danny Ings has been sidelined for the rest of the season with another serious injury. Not long back from a long spell out after damaging one knee, the young Liverpool striker suffered the heartbreak of knackering the other last week. Having gone under the surgeon\u2019s knife in London, now the long and lonely process of recovery begins. In public, the 24-year-old has been making predictably encouraging noises about not giving up and returning stronger, while his manager, team-mates and countless Liverpool fans have offered their unequivocal support at this difficult time. But Ings knows the drill: following the matter-of-fact news stories and that initial flurry of heartfelt sympathy, he will quickly be forgotten, left out of sight and mind among the ranks of football\u2019s invisibles as he deals with the lonely daily grind of recovery and rehabilitation. Pretty much every football memoir ever written includes a section devoted to a long period in the subject\u2019s career when they were sidelined by injury, and their accounts of the mental, as well as physical, toll these setbacks take invariably make for compelling reading. Confined to a training ground exclusion zone both for practical reasons and the fear they might in some way \u201ccontaminate\u201d more fortunate team-mates, they are quickly reduced to the status of nonperson. Some find themselves ignored by managers who, perhaps unwittingly, have little or no interest in acknowledging the existence of a player who is temporarily useless. Bill Shankly was fabled for the frostiness of the shoulder he used to turn the way of occupants of Liverpool\u2019s treatment room, his thinking being that they would step up their efforts to return to fitness if a working life spent in solitary was the alternative. In his autobiography, The Artist, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta provides a harrowing account of what the Barcelona midfielder described as \u201cnot depression, exactly, not illness, but an unease\u201d that descended upon him as he struggled to recover from the thigh injury that had previously threatened to keep him out of the 2009 Champions League final, a glorious treble season that should have been a career and life high point. \u201cIt grows, the problem snowballs,\u201d he told his collaborators. \u201cYou\u2019re not right, not well, but the people around you don\u2019t understand it, because the Andr\u00e9s they know isn\u2019t this Andr\u00e9s; they can\u2019t see that somehow you\u2019re empty on the inside. It\u2019s very hard.\u201d Dealt the subsequent hammer blow of the shock death from a heart attack of his lifelong friend the Espanyol defender Dani Jarque, a vulnerable Iniesta told the Barcelona physiotherapist Emili Ricart he felt he was made of glass. \u201cIt was like he thought he would never be right,\u201d said Ricart. \u201cThat he would never be fully fit again.\u201d Thank heavens he was wrong. Made of glass. It is almost identical to the expression Jimmy Bullard used when explaining when exactly it was he became aware the jig was nearly up as far as being a professional footballer was concerned. \u201cTowards the end of my career I felt like a glass ornament out there and whatever happened, I would get injured,\u201d he told me, looking full of uncharacteristic regret. Despite his childish eagerness to elicit giggles on every page of Bend It Like Bullard, he struggles to make light of the desolation he felt during long periods of rehab in the wake of two serious knee injuries. For all that, the image he conjures of himself and fellow invalid Owen Hargreaves forging an unlikely friendship over long hours on adjacent exercise bikes in a Colorado rehab centre does amuse. Niall Quinn suffered a similar purgatory but at least came out the other side the same, if not a better, player. After contracting septicaemia in the wake of a knee operation he arranged without the permission of his employers at Manchester City, the Irishman almost died and lost so much weight he looked like \u201ca dozen coat hangers stuck inside a sock\u201d. His long road to recovery began with weightlifting sessions, lifting nothing heavier than a sweeping brush. \u201cI hate liver,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI ate kidneys. I ate organs of some sort for breakfast, dinner and tea. I drank shakes that contained 5,000 calories a hit. Early on, I swam. After a while I did football exercises. As often as I could I went to the gym, sometimes three times a day.\u201d Imagine the tedium and ask if it\u2019s any wonder it takes such a psychological toll. \u201cAt home I became a bastard to live with,\u201d Quinn adds. \u201cNobody has ever felt more sorry for himself or self-absorbed.\u201d For those of us on the outside looking in, the footballer\u2019s lifestyle is enviable. But it is not all beer and skittles. Careers are short and for all their upbeat positivity in the immediate aftermath of calamitous misfortune, Ings and players like him must know they are about to endure a particularly long and special kind of mental hell."
"8||The Guardian view on Brexit ruling: the response to the courts threatens to undermine the bedrock of a democratic societyThe rule of law is the bedrock of a democratic society. It can check corruption and abuses of power. It permits individuals to order their lives. It allows private corporations, public bodies and the executive to regulate effectively their own activities. If the rule of law is to be upheld, it is vital that there should be an independent judiciary. This fact appears lost on Brexiter rabble-rousers. This voluble, influential political sect has unleashed gales of fury on the high court judges who ruled that only parliament has the authority to trigger article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, the legal route for Britain to leave the EU. Leading the charge are rightwing newspapers, which claim themselves to be champions of free speech and traditional British liberties. Yet since the Brexit vote they have sought to delegitimise their opponents\u2019 views and silence them through intimidation. This morning these newspapers laced racial innuendo with accusations of treachery, casting themselves as representatives of the people against unelected \u201cout of touch\u201d judges and their \u201cloaded foreign elite\u201d remainer acolytes. This is rhetoric that goes beyond character assassination and rightwing posturing into something darker and more dangerous. Remember, we are only months away from the gunning down of a pro-remain MP in broad daylight. During the course of this case, the bench \u2013 headed by the lord chief justice \u2013 was compelled to remind the gallery that threats against the claimants would be taken as contempt of court. The hysterical, and frankly ludicrous, response to the ruling was to claim that the judges\u2019 decision had sparked a crisis akin to that faced by Winston Churchill during world war two when he called on Britons to \u201cfight them on the beaches\u201d. This intolerance threatens to undermine political freedom and judicial independence. No court is infallible. One can dissent from judgments without trying, via newsprint and social media, to shatter a nation\u2019s confidence in judges as impartial guardians of the rule of law. Judges don\u2019t do opinions unless they are legal ones. Hence the need for politicians to speak up. So we ask: where is the prime minister in all this? Has she lost sight of the obvious \u2013 that the rule of law requires that the courts have jurisdiction to scrutinise the actions of government to ensure that they are lawful? Where, pray, is the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, who \u2013 as former office-bearer Charles Falconer notes \u2013 has a constitutional duty to defend the judges? The government will have its appeal heard in the supreme court next month. Unless ministers make clear their support for the judiciary, it looks as if the government is colluding to try to cow the highest courts in the land. The high court used Jacobean case law \u2013 \u201cthe King by his proclamation or other ways cannot change any part of the common law, or statute law, or the customs of the realm\u201d \u2013 to spike the government case that ministers have a right to invoke article 50 under the royal prerogative. The citizen must be able to challenge the executive before an independent judiciary. Because it is the executive that exercises the power of the state and because it is the executive which is a frequent litigator in the courts, it is from executive pressure or influence that judges require particularly to be protected. By standing by, ministers are encouraging mobocracy to overwhelm the rule of law."
"18||Sandman: is Neil Gaiman's comic masterpiece unfilmable?Perhaps we should be calling it \u201cThe Curse of Sandman\u201d. Another screenwriter who was on board to work on the long-proposed movie adaptation of the Neil Gaiman-penned comic book appears to have jumped ship. Eric Heisserer, whose credits include the recent remakes of 80s horror staples Nightmare on Elm Street and The Thing, was hired back in March by New Line as the latest writer for its troubled project to bring the DC/Vertigo comics series to the big screen. Heisserer was brought in just after director and actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt left the movie, citing creative differences with Warner subsidiary New Line. Sandman was created for DC by Gaiman in 1988 and as a comic book it ran for 75 issues, becoming part of the publisher\u2019s mature readers line Vertigo not long after it launched. It\u2019s a sweeping, epic narrative concerning not just Morpheus, the titular Sandman and lord of the realm of dreams, but also his \u201cEndless\u201d siblings \u2013 including Death, Destiny and Desire \u2013 and the diverse denizens of the otherworldly Dreaming. And perhaps that\u2019s where the trouble lies; Sandman is just too big to fit neatly into a two-hour movie slot. It wasn\u2019t composed of neat five- or six-issue story arcs as many comic series are today; it was a succession of long-running stories and one-off issues \u2013 some of which didn\u2019t feature the title character at all. Pretty much everyone agrees that Sandman would actually work better as a TV series. Heisserer told iO9: \u201cI had many conversations with Neil [Gaiman] on this, and I did a lot of work on the feature and came to the conclusion that the best version of this property exists as an HBO series or limited series, not as a feature film, not even as a trilogy. The structure of the feature film really doesn\u2019t mesh with this. So I went back and said here\u2019s the work that I\u2019ve done. This isn\u2019t where it should be. It needs to go to TV. So I talked myself out of a job!\u201d Gordon-Levitt wrote on his Facebook page six months ago when he left the film: \u201cA while back, David Goyer and I made a producing deal with Warner Brothers to develop a movie adaptation of Neil Gaiman\u2019s Sandman. Neil himself came on as an executive producer, we hired the excellent screenwriter Jack Thorne, and we started in on the ambitious task of adapting one of the most beloved and boundary-pushing titles in the world of comics. I was pleased with the progress we were making, even though we still had quite a ways to go.\u201d He went on to talk about the change in ownership of the Sandman material (it switched to Warner Brothers subsidiary New Line), before adding: \u201cI wish nothing but the best for the team moving forward.\u201d But is there any forward to move to? Though Gaiman created the characters \u2013 and made existing ones his own for the series \u2013 Sandman belongs to DC/Vertigo, not him, so he has no actual say in what happens with any adaptation. Gaiman has seen his work adapted for the big screen \u2013 notably his creepy children\u2019s book Coraline and his fairytale adventure Stardust \u2013 but has found equal, if not greater success in TV. Earlier this year in the UK, Sky Arts screened Neil Gaiman\u2019s Likely Stories, adapted from his short fiction, and next spring we see the much-anticipated Starz TV series based on his hit 2001 novel American Gods. Even American Gods was first mooted as a movie, because even 10 years ago that was considered the ultimate success story for an adaptation. It was considered too big and unwieldy to adapt for a single film, though. But now we live in something of a golden age for serial TV thanks to Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead. Gaiman told me earlier this year at the launch of Likely Stories: \u201cIt used to be that if you couldn\u2019t get a film you might get a movie made for TV or a miniseries, and that was considered quite a step down. But now people want to make TV. Here we are 15 years later, and what worked against us is actually on our side. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Which surely, as everyone suggests, is the route any adaptation of Sandman must go. Indeed, the very first plans to adapt Sandman were actually for TV: Supernatural creator Eric Kripke was initially attached to the series, but the project collapsed in 2011. Maybe if American Gods is the success everyone is anticipating then Warner/New Line will stop worrying and the curse can be put to bed."
"19||Good to meet you\u2026 Liz FoxI\u2019m a 26-year-old writer and graphic designer working for a small manufacturing non-profit in the States. Though I live in Cleveland, Ohio, I was brought up in the south and subjected to a second-rate education with little basis in fact or effectiveness. There wasn\u2019t much to satisfy my writing urges, and this, paired with a desire to draw up album reviews and let people know I listened to Brian Eno, led me to pursue a journalism degree. But by the time I got there, newspapers were already regarded as relics, and professors weren\u2019t betting on choice students becoming the next Woodward and Bernstein. The state of the industry was a constant water-cooler topic in the public radio office I worked in, and everything felt flat and ambivalent when it came to what would happen next. Then Cablegate happened. Specifically, a cache of over 400,000 US cables, war logs, and other confidential documents regarding the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were released by WikiLeaks in 2010, who had turned them over to the New York Times, the Guardian, and other outlets for publication. I had read the Guardian plenty before then (mainly arts and culture pieces), but since I\u2019m American, it was never as much of a cultural cornerstone as NYT. However, as the paper began publishing more on WikiLeaks, I found myself opened to an entirely new world of coverage, thanks to Nick Davies and a masterful feature on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. In an old paper for my law, policy and ethics course, I referred (pretentiously) to the leaks and corresponding coverage as \u201cthe Pentagon Papers of my generation\u201d. I can\u2019t say the same for Assange, but my fondness for the Guardian has only grown since then. The last few years have seen me falling in love with pieces by Owen Jones, Abi Wilkinson, and Rafael Behr, spanning topics from millennials to Boris Johnson to anti-semitism. Most recently, the paper\u2019s Brexit coverage \u2013 and the impending doom that comes with it \u2013 has been provocatively excellent, and I continually find new voices and reasons to keep reading. Though, I guess I could do with more Frankie Boyle, but couldn\u2019t we all? \u2022 If you would like to be interviewed in this space, send a brief note to good.to.meet.you@theguardian.com"
"1||Constitutional battle lines are being drawn following Brexit rulingNow the members of the demagogic right are demonstrating that they are not only a threat to our economic wellbeing but our constitutional settlement (Scotland weighs up whether to join in article 50 legal fight, 4 November). When Nigel Farage threatens those parliamentarians who delay or block Brexit with public anger (which he will do his best to provoke), he is denying parliament the right to hold the executive to account. He has no understanding of the role of the MP as the representative of the people and not its delegate (as defined by Edmund Burke) which until now was regarded as the correct understanding of the role of the MP. Britain is a representative or parliamentary democracy, not one ruled by plebiscite which is more characteristic of authoritarian states, such as Hitler\u2019s Third Reich. When Ukip\u2019s Suzanne Evans demands the sacking of the judges, she is undermining the independence of the judiciary, yet another of the bulwarks intended to prevent the arbitrary exercise of power by governments. Politicians such as these when they speak of the will of the people are using it as a means of removing from the constitution all those elements that they don\u2019t like, in particular those that protect the rights of minorities, in this case the 48% who voted remain. The Brexit debate is no longer just a debate on EU membership but a fight to retain those elements of the British constitution that make it a liberal democracy. Derrick Joad Leeds \u2022 The Burkean philosophy quoted by your correspondent (Letters 3 November) is the root of arrogance and self-righteousness of some members of parliament. Burke\u2019s flowery language can be reduced to ignoring your constituents\u2019 wishes if they do not accord with the representative\u2019s enlightened conscience entrusted by providence. Messianic zeal should have no place in a secular society. Steve Simmons Camberley, Surrey \u2022 The death threats made to Gina Miller are both scandalous and extremely worrying coming so soon after the tragic death of Jo Cox. Such scurrilous comments, bordering on xenophobia, should be refuted by our free press and not encouraged as we have seen from the rightwing press, describing the high court judges who ruled in the article 50 case as \u201cthe enemies of the people\u201d. Upholding the rule of law is at the cornerstone of our democracy and the judges involved have done just that. The true \u201cenemies of the people\u201d are those who rail so provocatively against them. George Longstaff Bidford-on-Avon \u2022 The argument about whether parliament or the prime minister should trigger article 50 clouds another issue: that article 50 is impossible to use. Under article 50, the other 27 member states can present an ultimatum, since the UK\u2019s membership will automatically cease after two years. Worse, even if a compromise is reached, it has to be approved by the European parliament. If MEPs reject the agreement, the UK will still have to leave. Thus, the 27 cannot credibly commit. The setup imposed by article 50 makes negotiation impossible. Invoking article 50 is close to unconditional surrender before negotiations have begun. Hopefully, parliament will have sense enough to see the futility of negotiating without any leverage and rule out the use of article 50. And hopefully, EU leaders and leaders of other member states will realise that their commitment not to negotiate before article 50 is invoked is not credible. A deal has to be struck, and it is pointless to demand that the UK surrenders all weapons before the fight has even begun. Brexit can mean anything. Just as the British crown has all sorts of arrangements with its various affiliated nations \u2013 the constituent nations of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, crown dependencies, etc \u2013 so can the EU have a variety of arrangements with the UK, possibly with special provisions for Scotland. This needs to be achieved by a treaty change or by some other means, instead of through the unusable article 50. Mikael Sandstr\u00f6m Saltsj\u00f6baden, Sweden \u2022 Steve Flatley (Letters, 3 November) suggests, perhaps tongue in cheek, that the government could appeal to the European court if they lose their article 50 case in the supreme court. I can\u2019t see that it\u2019s been pointed out yet that the supreme court must refer the case. The reasoning of the high court in deciding that the crown prerogative cannot be used proceeded from the initial assumption, agreed by the parties to the case as \u201ccommon ground\u201d, that notice of withdrawal under article 50 cannot be revoked. This is a matter of interpretation of article 50, and as the final court of appeal, the supreme court will be obliged to refer the case to the European court of justice under Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Peter Roderick Barrister and senior research fellow, Queen Mary, University of London \u2022 What a shambles. Cameron takes a bill to parliament to have a referendum he expects to vote remain to see off Ukip. The entire scrutiny process of the passage of the bill fails to ask whether this is our MPs\u2019 last say in the matter. So now our learned friends are making a pretty penny at our expense sorting out what I thought we paid our MPs to do. The only good thing is Nigel Farage being so cross that a British court has made a decision. John Beer Farnham, Surrey \u2022 The day after Sir John Chilcot, before a parliamentary committee, criticised Tony Blair because on several occasions between 2002 and 2007 \u201cthings were decided without reference to cabinet\u201d, the high court rules that government does not have the power it claimed to trigger article 50 without consulting parliament. Prime ministers should not have to be told these things. Adrian Betham London \u2022 The government should accept that parliament must have the right to debate and vote on the outcome of Brexit negotiations once these have been conducted. Conversely parliament should accept that the government is obliged to trigger those negotiations and that in doing so it is taking its instructions from the people. Roderick McCallum Annan, Dumfriesshire \u2022 The talk is all of early elections. What happened to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act? Is it to be scrapped at the first sign of inconvenience to the party in power? Bernard Besserglik Pantin, France \u2022 I am a pro-European. My issue with the court judgment is thus more one of efficiency than principle. International negotiations are complex and thus can only be a crown prerogative. On that same principle the deployment of British forces can only be a crown prerogative as parliamentary involvement can only forewarn those on the other side, like Isis terrorists. John Barstow Pulborough West Sussex \u2022 No, IDS. The court did not tell parliament how to do its job. It told parliament to do its job.

"7||My drab, dated dinner party for the over-55sI see from Ruby Tandoh\u2019s article (Made to share, G2, 3 November) that online sharing of food images is five times more likely to occur among those who are 18 to 24 than among those aged 55 and above. And, as a result, we are spared photos of \u201cold-fashioned sherry trifles, unpretty Irish stew or traditional meat-and-two-veg meals\u201d. I hope that Ruby manages to avoid dinner invitations from anyone over 55, including me. Although, on reflection, I shan\u2019t be inviting her, as I shall be too busy making sure that my dinner party signature dish of Irish stew (or meat-and-two-veg if I am pushing the boat out) looks and tastes suitably drab, whilst also leaving time for the trembling distribution of hundreds and thousands onto my pass\u00e9 trifle.

"15||StarCraft II: DeepMind unveils latest game its AI plans to conquerAfter its success at mastering the ancient Asian boardgame of Go, DeepMind is planning to learn its next game \u2013 and it\u2019s about as different as it can possibly be. The London-based AI research firm, a subsidiary of Google, is teaming up with Californian gaming company Blizzard to take on the real-time strategy game StarCraft II. One of the most popular eSports in the world, StarCraft II meets many of the requirements for an interesting challenge for DeepMind to take on. Not only do the game\u2019s best players easily beat the top AI opponents, but it also introduces new domains for the DeepMind team to explore. Most importantly, StarCraft II is a game full of hidden information. Each player begins on opposite sides of a map, where they are tasked with building a base, training soldiers, and taking out their opponent. But they can only see the area directly around units, since the rest of the map is hidden in a \u201cfog of war\u201d. \u201cPlayers must send units to scout unseen areas in order to gain information about their opponent, and then remember that information over a long period of time,\u201d DeepMind says in a blogpost. \u201cThis makes for an even more complex challenge as the environment becomes partially observable - an interesting contrast to perfect information games such as Chess or Go. And this is a real-time strategy game - both players are playing simultaneously, so every decision needs to be computed quickly and efficiently. \u201cAn agent that can play StarCraft will need to demonstrate effective use of memory, an ability to plan over a long time, and the capacity to adapt plans based on new information.\u201d The AI does have some innate advantages, however. One stat that top StarCraft players are ranked on is \u201cactions per minute\u201d (APM): essentially, the amount of times they click each minute. Lacking fingers, muscles, or the possibility of tendonitis, an AI can naturally outclick a human player, which could result in it winning not through strategic thinking but simply by reacting quicker. As a result, DeepMind will be capping the AI at what research scientist Oriol Vinyals describes as \u201chigh-level human\u201d speed. That also helps ensure the AI doesn\u2019t waste processing power making thousands of minor decisions a minute, and focuses it on the key points. Vinyals has long experience with StarCraft. In 2010, while an undergrad at UC Berkeley, he built an AI agent which could play the first game in the series better than any of the built-in AIs. But that bot was a simple scripted system, with each rule it followed lain down by hand, similar to how the best AIs played Go before DeepMind came along. In StarCraft II, as in Go, DeepMind wants to focus on machine learning, designing an AI that can teach itself to play the game. This time, the company\u2019s getting a helping hand from Blizzard, the developer behind StarCraft (as well as World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Overwatch), and that help will filter down to any other AI researcher who wants to take on the same challenge. In the first quarter of 2017, Blizzard will be updating StarCraft II to introduce a new AI research environment to the game, offering an API that developers can use to pull out extra information from the game to teach their bots how to play. The end goal for DeepMind is still to build a computer that can play StarCraft the way a person can, by simply looking at the pixels on the screen and sending keyboard and mouse input to manipulate them. But in the short term, it\u2019s a lot easier for DeepMind to teach their system with a simplified view, that spits out low resolution images of the map and mini map, and breaks down the features into different layers, clearly showing detail such as terrain height, unit type, and health. The collaboration is a two-way street, with Blizzard hoping to use the findings to improve its own games. \u201cIs there a world where an AI can be more sophisticated, and maybe even tailored to the player?\u201d Blizzard\u2019s Chris Sigaty, executive producer of StarCraft II, said. \u201cCan we do coaching for an individual, based on how we teach the AI? There\u2019s a lot of speculation on our side about what this will mean, but we\u2019re sure it will help improve the game.\u201d But the aim isn\u2019t just to improve video games. Vinyals says that StarCraft II is a natural next step for the studio\u2019s eventual goal to use AI to solve real-world problems. The lack of perfect information, the realistic (for a certain definition of \u201crealistic\u201d) visuals, the requirement to develop memory and even a sort of imagination all are important skills for an AI trying to understand the real world. Games are a better way to understand the real world than the real world, he says. \u201cYou can run them fast, there\u2019s a clear score, or winning and losing. There\u2019s also a lot of signals we can get from the game, and it\u2019s refined by somebody else who thought it was an interesting challenge for humans to learn and master.\u201d When DeepMind turned its attention to Go, it had beaten the best AI players within a year, and the best human player within two. But neither Vinyals nor Sigaty are eager to stake their colours to the mast on how long it will take for AI to master StarCraft II. \u201cFrom a research standpoint, we might make great advances, but I think it\u2019s way too early to know whether we could beat the best,\u201d says Vinyals. Sigaty is slightly more confident. \u201cI stand by our pros. They\u2019re amazing to watch.\u201d"
"6||It\u2019s a mistake to demonise RussiaI can\u2019t understand your antagonism towards Russia (If the west is weak, Putin\u2019s Russia is a much greater threat, 3 November). The west needs Russia to stabilise the Middle East, bring together conflicting sides to the negotiating table and forge an inclusive political solution to the ongoing violence in Syria. Russia is an indispensable partner in the global battle against the scourge of terrorism; it has endured despicable terrorist attacks against its innocent citizens, such as at Beslan. It is in the west\u2019s best interests to cooperate with Russia. Dr Munjed Farid Al Qutob London \u2022 Your interview with the MI5 head Andrew Parker (1 November) confirmed the prediction I have stated publicly since 1991 in my lectures, published letters and books: Russia will be an increasing threat, which will probably lead to confrontations, eventually maybe military, and possibly even WW3. However, this does not necessarily mean that Russia is deliberately planning any of this \u2013 hence paradoxically the Kremlin\u2019s refutations, including of this interview\u2019s accusations, could be at least partially true. Dr Marek Laskiewicz Polish Association in Great Britain \u2022 The foreign policy of the US and its European allies has resulted in catastrophe for the peoples of the Middle East and North Africa, and terrorism and the refugee crisis are part of the blowback. Yet all your editorial (2 November) can do is blame everything on Russia using the discredited narrative of the hawks in Washington. Has the Guardian become part of Washington\u2019s propaganda machine? John Lyst Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside \u2022 When considering Russia\u2019s response to Nato activities, especially near its western frontier, it is necessary to remember that in June 1941, a powerfully armed Germany attacked a weakly armed Soviet Union. Huge areas of the country were overrun and devastated. Recapturing the lost lands took four years and cost more than 20 million Soviet lives. We call it world war two, the Russians call it the Great Patriotic War.

"20||Jean cut-off rule is arbitrary and ageistI hope other people were as cross as I was about the article regarding a survey that said the cut-off year for wearing jeans is 53 (G2, 3 November). What happens to us after 53? Virginia Ironside expresses the patronising view that Carol Klein, in her early 70s, can get away with wearing jeans, as she is a gardener. As can cowboys and physical workers. I hit 80 this year and intend to go on wearing jeans \u2013 and feeling good in them \u2013 for as long as I can pull them on! Marion Gough Walton-on-Thames, Surrey \u2022 What rubbish. I am 75 and will continue to wear jeans as long as I can get them on. I look great in them as do all my friends, skinny or ample. The whole point of jeans is that they fade, and adapt themselves to your shape. Sarah Carter Canterbury \u2022 So when are men supposed to stop wearing jeans? I suggest when they are 55, one year younger than Jeremy Clarkson. The cut-off point could move up a year each year. Margaret Squires St Andrews \u2022 So Virginia Ironside, what are people over the age of 53 supposed to wear, elasticated waist beige slacks? I\u2019m a trim size 10, attend five gym classes a week, walk six to eight miles once or twice a week, plus a daily 30-60-minute walk each day with our dog.

It\u2019s about size and not age, just because Virginia doesn\u2019t wear jeans it doesn\u2019t mean everyone else can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t.

"22||Four Wahaca branches remain closed after suspected norovirus casesFour London branches of the Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca remain closed after a suspected outbreak of norovirus affected more than 350 customers and staff. Environmental health officers and officials from Public Health England (PHE) were called in after a suspected outbreak of the winter vomiting bug struck nine branches last week. All were shut down; five have since reopened. \u201cThe majority of our restaurants are open and we hope to reopen the four remaining sites, on a case-by-case basis, as soon as we feel we are ready to do so,\u201d said co-founders Mark Selby and Thomasina Miers in a statement published on the chain\u2019s website. The branches that are still closed are all in London: Canary Wharf, Covent Garden, Oxford Circus and Soho. a spokesperson for the company said there would be an update on the situation on Monday. Norovirus, which causes diarrhoea and vomiting, is one of the most common stomach bugs and, while it is more common in winter, can be caught at any time of the year. It usually clears up by itself in a few days. The virus can rapidly spread in public places and can be caught through close contact with someone with the virus (if they breathe out particles containing the virus), touching contaminated surfaces or eating contaminated food that has been handled by an affected person who has not washed their hands. Deborah Turbitt, London deputy director for health protection for PHE, advised people affected to drink lots of fluids to avoid dehydration, and to avoid going to their GP in case they spread it to others. The statement by Miers, a former MasterChef winner, and Selby said: \u201cWe are incredibly sorry that people have been unwell. In the nine years since we first opened Wahaca we have never had such an unprecedented incident, and we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of how this may have happened.\u201d A Day of the Dead event planned for Thursday evening was cancelled as a result of the outbreak, and ticket buyers were refunded. Selby and Miers added: \u201cWe want to make sure that our time and efforts are being spent with our teams so that we can get the restaurants affected back up and running as soon as possible, and that any staff and customers affected can make a speedy recovery.\u201d"
"17||Government blocks attempt to ban unpaid internshipsThe government has blocked an attempt to have unpaid internships banned, but is to investigate the practice as part of the current review of modern working practices. Draft legislation put forward by Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke was designed to ensure that anyone working as an intern would be paid the minimum wage, which depends on the age of the worker. Speaking in parliament he described internships as \u201cthe acceptable face of unpaid labour in modern Britain today\u201d. He added, they \u201cshould have no place in a meritocratic country that aims to work for the many and not the privileged few\u201d. He added that his bill was designed to end \u201ca new rise in the class society that means only those from a wealthy background can gain a privileged leg-up\u201d. However, the bill was talked out by Conservative colleagues. Instead, the business minister, Margot James, said that the government would ask Matthew Taylor to include unpaid internships in his review of employment practices. The former adviser to Tony Blair is investigating the impact of the UK\u2019s growing gig economy on workers\u2019 rights. Speaking about Shelbrooke\u2019s bill, James told MPs: \u201cWhile it\u2019s extremely well-intentioned, I do have concerns that it could have unintended consequences that might even undermine existing employment laws and protections,\u201d she told MPs. She added that if interns met the legal definition of workers in employment law, they were already entitled to the minimum wage. A ban on the use of unpaid internships was recommended two years ago by the government\u2019s social mobility tsar, Alan Milburn, but firms have continued to be able to advertise positions that do not offer a wage. The campaign group Intern Aware said two-thirds of businesses backed a four-week limit on unpaid placements, and just 12% opposed such a cap. Ben Lyons, Intern Aware co-director, said: \u201cIt is positive that the review is going to be looking at this as it is a major issue, which is reducing social mobility and pricing young people out of professions. However, it is disappointing that the government talked out the bill.\u201d Lyons said Shelbrooke\u2019s bill had been \u201ca real opportunity\u201d for the government to back up Theresa May\u2019s pledges to make progress on social mobility. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a sizeable minority of internships which are unpaid \u2013 we are surprised that more action hasn\u2019t been taken.\u201d Internships are controversial because they are perceived as biased towards the children of well-off professional parents who live in London. They are able to tap into their parents\u2019 contacts to get valuable work experience and can also afford to take unpaid roles. In her speech to the Tory party conference last month, the prime minister said she intended to tackle unfairness and ensure \u201cordinary working-class people\u201d had \u201caccess to the opportunities that are too often the preserve of the privileged few\u201d. Shelbrooke highlighted how some MPs were using unpaid placements. \u201cA quick scan of the [w4mp] website shows roughly 22 MPs advertising for unpaid interns outside of the politics and parliamentary study scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sends a message to businesses across the United Kingdom that exploiting \u2026 young workers is acceptable.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is committed to building an economy that works for all, not just the privileged few. It\u2019s important that young people have access to employment and work experience regardless of their background.\u201d"

"3||Vishy Anand, world champion before Magnus Carlsen, loses in CorsicaMagnus Carlsen and Sergey Karjakin are making final preparations for their 12-game, $1.25m world title series which starts in New York on 11 November. Meanwhile the man who competed in all the championship events for much of the previous decade has just been beaten in a rapidplay in Corsica. India\u2019s Vishy Anand, 46, won the world crown in 2007 and defended it several times until Carlsen, 20 years his junior, defeated him easily in his home city of Chennai/Madras in 2013. Anand then surprisingly won the next candidates tournament to qualify for a return where he put up a better fight and would have had good chances if he had taken advantage of a huge Norwegian blunder in mid-match. Nowadays Anand remains a serious contender in elite tournaments where in-depth opening preparation is a major factor but he has become more vulnerable in dogfights, even against lesser masters. He lost twice to weaker rivals and dropped 22 rating points during a lacklustre performance at Tradewise Gibraltar 2016, his first open since 1993, while he declined inclusion in the young Indian team which won bronze at the 2014 Olympiad and narrowly missed medals in 2016. The \u20ac102,000 Corsica rapidplay started with an open from which 12 winners qualified for the knockout phase along with the four seeds Anand, France\u2019s world No3, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, the world woman champion, Hou Yifan, and the Bulgarian GM Teimour Radjabov. Knockout results went mostly to form and in the semis Vachier-Lagrave beat the strong Ukrainian Anton Korobov (who had eliminated Hou Yifan) while Anand ground down Radjabov, After a draw in their first game Anand lost to Vachier-Lagrave in a hot Najdorf Sicilian novelty 6 Nb3. There are only a handful of examples of this move before spring 2016, when the Polish GM Mateusz Bartel started playing it with success, and the elite quickly spotted the innovation on their databases. Soon 6 Nb3 was used by Hikaru Nakamura (twice) against Vachier-Lagrave in the Brussels leg of the Grand Tour, by Wei Yi in the Chinese League and by Alexander Grischuk in his silver-medal winning game in the final round of the Russian championship. No wonder Anand decided to give it a try. Vachier-Lagrave countered dynamically by 10...Bh6?! and a critical moment came four moves later when 14 c4! looks better.

"16||'We thought it was going to destroy us' \u2026 Herzog and De Meuron's Hamburg miracleRising more than 100 metres above Hamburg\u2019s harbour like a great glass galleon marooned atop an old brick warehouse, the Elbphilharmonie concert hall looks as unreal as its computer renderings, first published 13 years ago to gasps of incredulity. The gargantuan glass tent rises to a roofline of frothing peaks, inscribing a silhouette of waves across the city\u2019s low-rise skyline, like a chunk of the sea that\u2019s been frozen, chiselled out of the water and craned into place. Its glacial walls ripple and bulge, their surface punctured with convex semi-circular openings, forming a cliff-face of little mouths gaping in glee. It\u2019s only appropriate for the building to have the last laugh. A national embarrassment for the last decade, as the budget galloped ever higher, with construction mired in delays and the very real threat that its carcass might be left as an Ozymandian ruin, this \u20ac789m mega-project is finally complete \u2013 and it is thankfully every bit as spectacular as its architects promised. Standing on the roof, surrounded by heaving valleys of gleaming white sequins that swell to a spiky mountain range, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron have never looked so relieved. \u201cThere were moments when we thought this building would destroy our whole career,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cSomehow we were responsible for this total disaster, because we had seduced the people with our design.\u201d The project began as the unlikely dream of Alexander G\u00e9rard, a private developer and former classmate of Herzog and De Meuron, who had hoped to finance the scheme with the 45 luxury flats and 250-room hotel that are also housed in the big glass mountain. He commissioned the architects to come up with a dazzling alternative to a dreary plan for a 90-metre media office tower on the site, which died away with the end of the dotcom boom. The Swiss starchitects\u2019 thrilling images quickly caught the public imagination and the project was adopted by the city in 2003 and prioritised as a plan of national importance. Launched with a price tag of \u20ac77m (which Herzog says was \u201cabsurdly low\u201d and never actually costed), and scheduled to open in 2010, the finished project has cost 10 times that amount and been subject to a catalogue of disputes, lawsuits and a lengthy parliamentary inquiry. The resulting 800-page report noted witheringly that \u201cthe claim of a public sector building to be counted among world architecture does not necessarily extend to toilet brushes costing \u20ac291.97 each\u201d. Exploring the voluptuous caves and terraced levels housed within this vast iceberg, it is clear that the toilet brushes were one of the cheaper items on the shopping list. It is a project on an unparalleled scale of ambition, an ocean liner of architectural virtuosity that revels in its sculptural feats and bespoke craftsmanship. The grand hall, itself hung from the 700-tonne roof like a dangling cocoon, features 1,000 hand-blown glass lamps and 10,000 uniquely carved acoustic panels, while the facade incorporates 600 curved panes of 48mm-thick glass. It has been compared to Kaiser Wilhelm\u2019s megalomania, but it\u2019s fair to say it gives the pharaohs a run for their money. Echoes of Giza begin with the arrival sequence, where visitors are transported up an 80-metre escalator in a creamy spangle-lined tunnel, as if the entrance to the Great Pyramid had been masterminded by Liberace. The escalator is gently curved in a hump-backed profile, so you can\u2019t see where you\u2019re going, adding to the camp drama of it all, before you emerge at a big picture window punched into the brick wall, affording the first great view across the harbour. From here, a second escalator leads up to a brick-paved plaza on the roof of the old warehouse, planned as a new (free, but ticketed) public space for the city, jacked 40 metres up in the air. It is one of the project\u2019s most exhilarating moments, where you\u2019re sandwiched between the plinth of the brick shed (which now mostly houses the car park) and the diaphanous cloud of culture above. A sculpted white ceiling swoops above your head, flaring out on either side of the building to frame views of the city in a pair of vaulted apses \u2013 an appropriate form for what is a cathedral of our time. Sleek curtain walls of rippling glass lead out to a walkway that runs around the entire 340-metre perimeter of the building, like being on the deck of a liner, from where you can survey a horizon of shipping cranes to one side, church spires to the other. \u201cOur role is to connect the old city with the new city beyond,\u201d says De Mueron, referring to the HafenCity quarter, an emerging district slated to house 12,000 people in the former docklands, in which the \u201cElphie\u201d, as locals have nicknamed the concert hall, stands as a shining beacon. From the plaza, wide staircases spiral up between the curvaceous white walls, recalling the generous sweeping levels of Eero Saarinen\u2019s 1960s TWA terminal in New York, leading concert-goers up through a precipitous crevasse, carved out between the grand hall and the rest of the building. \u201cWe really hacked this space out,\u201d says Herzog, jabbing at the air with his big imaginary knife. \u201cIt was an archaic, kindergarten process of sculpting and carving,\u201d he says, describing how they attacked their 5-metre-wide cardboard study models. \u201cMore than any other building we\u2019ve done, we needed to use different methods to design these spaces. They could not be done on the computer.\u201d He\u2019s right. There is an intricacy and complexity to the sequence that sets it apart from the parametrically generated formal acrobatics of their contemporaries. These are spaces that have been designed from the inside out, prised open in a process of keyhole surgery, with an acute sensitivity to the experience of rising through the building. Much of it is down to the relentless perfectionism of Ascan Mergenthaler, the busy partner in charge of the Tate Modern Switch House, Oxford\u2019s Blavatnik School of Government and Hong Kong\u2019s M+ museum too \u2013 projects that all revel in their interior spatial drama, driven by a precise choreography of how people move through them. \u201cWe want visitors to be flushed into the hall,\u201d says Mergenthaler, walking through one of the relatively narrow tributaries that feed into the main auditorium, describing the movement of his audience in terms of fluid dynamics. Once you\u2019re inside, you can see why. Seating 2,100 people in a steeply sculpted bowl, it feels like entering a rock pool, a coral cave carved out by millennia of erosion. Chiselled balconies spill from one level to the next, connected by steps in one continuous terraced landscape. Every surface is covered in a pitted mineral texture of little stalactites, CNC-milled from gypsum fibreboard, that compresses and expands as it ripples around the room, mapping the invisible mechanics of acoustic absorption and reflection. A huge pendulous mushroom plunges down from the ceiling, serving as both an acoustic reflector and a space-age chandelier. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the usual velvety \u2018salon\u2019 aesthetic, or the wooden instrument cliche,\u201d says Mergenthaler. Instead they have taken the \u201cvineyard\u201d form (pioneered by Hans Scharoun\u2019s 1963 Berlin Philharmonic, whose tent-like roof is also echoed here) and cross-fertilised it with the verticality of a Shakespearean theatre and the packed intensity of a football stadium. Tuned by renowned Japanese acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota, the proof of the pudding will come only in January, when the concert season begins. (NB music fans, De Meuron confides that the cheapest seats at the top actually have the best acoustic.) The second, smaller hall is a totally different affair, an oblong shoebox for chamber music and recitals that feels hollowed out from a giant tree-trunk, again milled with a pleasingly lumpy surface. Deeper in the bowels of the old cocoa warehouse, meanwhile, there is a studio for more experimental music, where we find Brian Eno hunched on a stool, surrounded by tea-lights in the middle of a dark room, honing his immersive audio installation for the opening. It is one of the many surreal situations awaiting discovery in this sprawling vertical city of culture, a bygone species of building that won\u2019t be repeated for a very long time. \u201cThe whole thing is really so unlikely,\u201d says Herzog, reflecting on the last 13 years of struggle. \u201cIt almost happened by chance, from this individual, whose idea then gained a kind of bottom-up momentum. You could not win with such a thing in a design competition. And perhaps we are the last generation of \u2018author\u2019 style architects to have such a chance.\u201d Late to the party: 10 other massively delayed mega-projects City of Culture of Galicia Rearing up on the hillside above the historic town of Santiago de Compostela, this gargantuan \u20ac400m cultural complex opened in 2011, nine years late and four times over budget \u2013 and still only half finished. The work of the US architect and theorist Peter Eisenman, it was described as \u201can expensive mistake\u201d by one member of the original competition jury. \u201cProbably one of the largest in the history of architecture.\u201d Philharmonie de Paris Like one of George Lucas\u2019s menacing starships crash-landed on the Boulevard P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, the \u20ac390m concert hall finally opened last year, two years late and three times over budget. \u201cThe architecture is martyred, the details sabotaged,\u201d complained its architect, Jean Nouvel, who boycotted the inauguration, accusing his client of \u201ccontempt for architecture, for the profession and for the architect of the most important French cultural programme of the new century\u201d. Scottish parliament building Writhing at the bottom of Arthur\u2019s Seat in Edinburgh, in a tangled collision of granite, concrete and splintered wooden shards, the \u00a3414m Scottish parliament building opened in 2004, more than three years late and five times over its original budget. Designed by the Spanish architect Enric Miralles, the aesthetic of instability proved more than just visual: a big wooden beam fell down in the main chamber soon after completion, doors buckled, windows cracked, the roof started leaking \u2013 and a flock of pigeons took up residence. Valencia City of Arts and Sciences Standing as the futuristic white tomb of Spain\u2019s splurge on starchitectural vanity projects, this vast complex by Santiago Calatrava was four times over budget, with a price tag of over \u20ac1bn. Receiving fees of \u20ac100m, Calatrava was accused of \u201cbleeding Valencia dry\u201d. In 2013, just eight years after its inauguration, chunks of mosaic tiling were already falling off the swooping opera house roof. Wembley stadium The serene white arch that rises above the west London skyline belies the contorted mess of political and legal wrangling behind the biggest stadium in the UK, which finally opened in 2007, eight years late and almost triple the original budget at \u00a3798m \u2013 making it one of the most expensive stadiums ever built. The aftermath was mired in lawsuits, including the largest construction claim in UK legal history. Sydney Opera House It may be one of the most iconic buildings in the world, but it had an iconic price tag and delay to match. When the Sydney Opera House finally opened in 1973, J\u00f8rn Utzon\u2019s spectacular cluster of white sails was 10 years late and almost 15 times the original budget \u2013 and the Danish architect had long since walked off the project over disagreements with the client. Boston\u2019s Big Dig A topic of debate for three decades, Boston\u2019s grand plan to bury the city\u2019s central highway in a 3.5-mile tunnel ended up costing $14.8bn. Begun in 1982, it was plagued by escalating costs, overruns, leaks, accusations of shoddy workmanship and substandard materials, criminal arrests and a death. Originally scheduled to be complete in 1998 at a cost of $2.8bn, it was finally completed in 2007. The Boston Globe estimated that the project will ultimately cost $22bn, including interest \u2013 and that it won\u2019t be paid off until 2038. World Trade Center The inevitably compromised product of a decade of fraught political battles, New York\u2019s most emotionally charged site is emerging as an unparalleled exhibition of \u201cboondoggles\u201d, to use that wonderful American word. Santiago Calatrava\u2019s $4bn station is finally up and running, six years late and twice the original budget, while the cost of One World Trade Center also spiralled to $4bn, making it the most expensive office tower of all time. Montreal Olympic stadium Dubbed the \u201cBig Owe\u201d for saddling the city with crushing debt, Montreal\u2019s 1976 Olympic stadium cost $1.5bn, which was only paid off in 2006, more than 30 years after it opened. Designed by the French architect Roger Taillibert with a retractable roof, operated by cables suspended from the tallest inclined structure in the world, it wasn\u2019t finished in time for the games. The roof components languished in a warehouse in Marseille until 1982, and the tower and roof were not completed until 1987. Berlin Brandenburg airport After nearly 15 years in the planning process, construction of Berlin\u2019s new airport began in 2006, and there is still no end in sight. Originally scheduled to open in 2011, it has been beset by issues ranging from corruption to malfunctioning smoke vents and structural issues with the roof. It has already missed four opening deadlines, during which time the budget has soared from \u20ac1.7bn to over \u20ac5bn. The mayor has suggested it miiight be ready by 2018, but don\u2019t hold your breath."

Parted after the death of their mother when Dorothy was only six, they were not reunited until their teenage years. They became inseparable and William referred to her as one of \u201cthe two Beings to whom my intellect is most indebted\u201d. She was his muse, the first reader of his poems, an attentive editor, amanuensis, critic and, as William said, \u201cthe dear companion of my lonely walk\u201d. But more than this, Newlyn argues, the two were equal partners in writing and their intense love of the Lake District resulted in a \u201cdistinctively symbiotic contribution to Romantic environmentalism\u201d.

"17||Sterling soars on Trump jitters and Brexit hopesSpeculation that the UK could avoid a hard Brexit from the European Union, and fears that Donald Trump might snatch a last-minute victory in the race for the White House, have helped sterling register its biggest weekly gain against the US dollar in seven years. The pound\u2019s respite from its recent heavy falls on the foreign exchanges continued on Friday when it put on a cent against the US currency to trade at $1.2558 \u2013 its highest level for four weeks. Sterling\u2019s rally came despite labour market data from the US, which strengthened Wall Street\u2019s belief that official borrowing costs in the world\u2019s biggest economy will be raised before Christmas. Currency dealers paid less interest than usual to the 161,000 increase in non-farm employment last month and the 0.4% increase in hourly earnings, focusing instead on the knife-edge battle between Hillary Clinton and Trump for the presidency. The pound has been rising since the start of the week after evidence of a narrowing of Clinton\u2019s opinion-poll lead and amid evidence from forward-looking business surveys that the UK economy was set to grow robustly in the fourth quarter of 2016. Sterling then received a double-boost on Thursday when the high court ruled that the government could not trigger article 50 to leave the EU without the approval of parliament, and the Bank of England announced that it had abandoned plans for a second post-referendum stimulus. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a bit of a relief rally now that the worst-case scenario of a unilateral hard Brexit has been deferred, and markets can start focusing on other factors (like) the US presidential election,\u201d said CMC analyst Michael Hewson. Investors believe turbulent market conditions will continue, with a government appeal against the high court ruling scheduled for next month, and some analysts weighing up the chances that Theresa May will call an early election to push ahead with Brexit. \u201cJust as markets were looking forward to getting the US election out of the way, this week has seen speculation that another UK election could be right around the corner,\u201d said Paul Hollingsworth, chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. The pound ended the week almost 3% higher against the dollar - its strongest performance since October 2009 \u2013 but remained 16% lower than it was before the Brexit referendum in late June. Sterling\u2019s depreciation has been helpful for the City\u2019s main stock market yardstick \u2013 the FTSE 100 \u2013 since many of the companies included in the index have dollar earnings which are flattered by a drop in the pound. This week\u2019s rise in sterling was accompanied by the biggest drop in the FTSE 100 since January. A fall of 97 points on Friday to 6,693 points brought the cumulative loss over the week to 301 points \u2013 a 4.3% decline. The FTSE 250, which includes more domestically focused companies, posted a smaller 1.8% weekly fall. The last set of US labour market figures before Tuesday\u2019s election showed a slightly smaller increase in non-farm payrolls than the 175,000 rise Wall Street had been expecting. But analysts said the improvement was solid enough to persuade the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised up jobs growth for August and September by a combined 44,000 and said annual wages growth had edged up from 2.7% to 2.8% \u2013 a seven-year high. \u201cIt seems that the only remaining obstacle to the Fed hiking in December would be a significant adverse financial market reaction to the US presidential election,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the consultancy IHS Markit. Squabbling between Saudi Arabia and Iran has sent the oil price down, as tension between the near neighbours threatened to derail talks aimed at cutting production by the Opec group of oil-producing countries. Riyadh is reportedly threatening to turn the screw on Tehran before this month\u2019s crucial Opec meeting by increasing its own output to push prices even lower. Saudi Arabia produces up to 10.7m barrels per day (bpd) at the moment, but Opec sources said it had threatened to open the taps much further. \u201cThe Saudis have threatened to raise their production to 11m bpd and even 12m bpd, bringing oil prices down, and to withdraw from the meeting,\u201d one Opec source told Reuters. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude dropped to $45.02 before recovering to $45.42, down 2%, after Opec\u2019s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, denied Saudi Arabia had made any threats."
"15||Samsung recalls 2.8m washing machines after reports of explosionsSamsung and US safety officials announced a recall on Friday of nearly 3m washing machines after reports that the appliances \u2013 just like the company\u2019s Note 7 smartphones \u2013 are exploding and injuring people. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Friday that Samsung has received 733 reports of washing machines \u201cexperiencing excessive vibration or the top detaching from the washing machine chassis\u201d. Injuries in the reports include a broken jaw, an injured shoulder, and bruises and blunt force injuries, the agency said. The recall will affect 34 models of washing machines, about 2.8m machines in total, sold since 2011. Customers can either have a free repair and one-year warranty, an exchange rebate on a new washing machine (with \u201cloyalty incentive up to $150\u201d) for a Samsung purchase), or a full refund for eligible new customers. The CPSC also said that customers will receive a safety kit and instructions until their machines can be repaired, and they should be warned to use slower spin settings for bulky items until then. In its own statement, Samsung said the recall does not affect models sold outside North America. \u201cOur priority is to minimize any safety risk and address the conditions that lead to the rare instance when the top of the washer unexpectedly separates from the unit,\u201d the electronics and appliance company said in a statement. \u201cWe apologize for the inconvenience this is creating to our loyal customers. We have worked closely with the CPSC to offer a consumer friendly recall that is safe, easy and complete with choices suited to the needs of anyone who may own a recalled machine.\u201d The recall follows a lawsuit filed earlier this year by two consumers, Suzann Moore and Michelle Soto Fielder, who alleged that the washing machines were \u201cdefectively designed and imposed an unreasonable risk to person and property\u201d. \u201cThere is no reasonable or acceptable rate for washing machines to explode,\u201d they wrote in their complaint. \u201cMichelle\u2019s washing machine exploded with such ferocity that it penetrated the interior wall of her garage, where it was located. The dent left at the washing machine\u2019s point of impact was so deep that it pushed through into Michelle\u2019s living room, which shares a wall with her garage.\u201d Melissa Thaxton, another woman who reported an incident to Samsung, told ABC News that her machine blew up in April. \u201cIt was the loudest sound. It sounded like a bomb went off in my ear,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember covering my head and leaning towards my son and just screaming this scream that I didn\u2019t even know I could scream.\u201d In 2013 Samsung ordered a recall of about 150,000 washing machines in Australia, fearing that the machines could cause fires. And in September, US officials and Samsung ordered a recall of the company\u2019s Galaxy Note 7 smartphone following reports that the devices caught fire. Last month the company ended production of the phones, and it was sued in California court by a woman who said the phone problems extended beyond the Note 7 model. The South Korean firm\u2019s profits fell by 30% in the third quarter of 2016."

"17||Virgin to get an extra year running west coast mainlineSir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Rail looks set to be granted a further, uncontested 12-month contract to run west coast intercity trains, after the government confirmed that the next winner of the franchise would also operate the first high-speed HS2 trains. A new delay in the Department for Transport\u2019s franchising schedule has left the door open for Branson to keep the service for another year. Branson has taken an average \u00a317m in annual dividends from Intercity West Coast, the London to Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow service, over the last three years. The proposed West Coast Partnership franchise, announced on Friday by the DfT, will start no longer start in 2018 but rather in April 2019. The winner will run mainline trains from 2019 and be involved in the design and launch of high-speed services, before running HS2\u2019s trains between London and Birmingham for three to five years from 2026. The DfT said the joint franchise would attract \u201ca world-class bidding group to develop and enhance the service\u201d. Unions and Labour criticised the plan. Transport minister Andrew Jones said: \u201cWe are embarking on a new chapter in our modernisation of the railways and we need world-class expertise to deliver it. HS2 will be the backbone of Britain\u2019s railways, creating more seats for passengers on the west coast and increasing capacity on the rest of the network. \u201cBy combining the franchise we are ensuring we get the right people on board at an early stage to design and manage the running of both services in the transition stage.\u201d In the first phase of HS2, trains will travel on new high-speed tracks between London and Birmingham and continue north from the West Midlands on the existing west coast mainline. Sir David Higgins, chairman of HS2 Ltd, said: \u201cThis is a real opportunity to ensure HS2 services complement and enhance existing ones. I have always been clear HS2 will not be a standalone railway but fully integrated with the wider network.\u201d The government is expecting the winning bidder to work with HS2 Ltd in the design and launch of the high-speed train services. The opportunity to be the first operator of HS2 trains could be seen as an incentive to run a franchise which will be beset by disruption as the infrastructure is developed before 2026 \u2013 particularly in and out of London Euston, where the platforms will be rebuilt. But analysts warned that committing to operate the new network would also carry substantial risk. The west coast timetable will be radically redrawn after HS2, which will provide faster intercity trains and free up more paths for commuter services on existing tracks. Labour said that it would bring back the franchise into public ownership as soon as possible in government. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cIf we are going to invest billions of taxpayers\u2019 money into HS2 it is right that the revenues go back to the exchequer and not straight into the hands of subsidy-dependent train operating companies.\u201d Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said that while the introduction of high-speed services was welcome, he \u201cdeplored ... this government\u2019s continued obsession with the failed franchise model, which is selling commuters and businesses short, and the idea that the way forward is to allow a few people to make a private profit at public expense\u201d. Christian Wolmar, the rail historian, said he doubted the planned, combined franchise could provide value for taxpayers. He warned: \u201cFranchising is an unsuitable policy because of the way that railways change and transform, so predicting the passenger numbers for the future is a mug\u2019s game. \u201cI don\u2019t think that risk can be taken by the private sector without massive compensation. We will end up paying for a risk that cannot be transferred. It\u2019s a crazy approach to running a rail service.\u201d Just four years ago, Virgin took legal action to wrest back the lucrative west coast franchise after being outbid on the rights by rivals First Group. However, the DfT has since made a succession of direct awards, allowing Virgin to operate the franchise without competition until 2018. According to accounts from Stagecoach, Branson\u2019s 49% partner in Virgin Rail, net payments to the government from the west coast franchise over the last three years have totalled \u00a3375m, with dividends to the shareholders totalling \u00a3101m. A detailed invitation to tender for the new franchise will be published in late 2017, with the winning bidder named the following year."
"5||'Trump Place' polling site irks New York City votersThe seemingly interminable and acrimonious presidential election will finally draw to a close on Tuesday, but not before some residents of the overwhelmingly Democratic New York City are dealt a final indignity: being forced to cast their vote in a building named Trump Place. The official polling site address for people living in sections of Riverside Boulevard, in Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, is: Trump Place, 180 Riverside Boulevard. It has irked some voters already sensitive about living in the building, which bears the Republican nominee\u2019s name. The building was developed by Trump in the 1990s, but is no longer managed by his company. \u201cHis views are just completely disconnected from the reality of people who live here,\u201d said Erin Kelly. She lives on Riverside Boulevard and will be voting in Trump Place on Tuesday, though not for Donald Trump. \u201cIt had not occurred to me that I\u2019d have to vote in a building with Trump\u2019s name on it until I went to verify that my registration was still valid. And there it was. That was my polling place,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cMy consolation is knowing that the majority of the voters who have to vote there will not actually be voting for Trump.\u201d In 2012 President Barack Obama won 83.75% of the vote in Manhattan. Mitt Romney got 14.92%. The New York City board of elections did not respond to a request for comment, but its website displays the Trump polling station. \u201cTrump Place\u201d appears in a large font with \u201c180 Riverside Boulevard\u201d written underneath. Residents wishing to exercise their voting rights will have to walk beneath a large gold \u201cTrump Place\u201d sign. There is no building in Manhattan bearing the Clinton name, although there is a William J Clinton Presidential Center and Park \u2013 Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential library \u2013 in Little Rock, Arkansas. A spokesman for Arkansas\u2019s Pulaski County board of elections, which covers Little Rock, said the Clinton presidential center was not a polling site. The Trump Place polling station is a sensitive issue as a number of local residents are currently campaigning to have his name removed from their buildings. Trump developed the apartments, between 59th Street and 71st Street on the west side of Manhattan, in partnership with investors from Hong Kong in the 1990s, according to the New York Times. Seven buildings bear the Trump name, although the three apartment buildings at 140, 160 and 180 Riverside Boulevard are no longer managed by Trump, and in October residents started a petition to have the Trump signage removed. The petition cited Trump\u2019s \u201cappalling treatment of women, his history of racism, his attacks on immigrants, his mockery of the disabled, his tax avoidance [and] his outright lying\u201d as factors in wanting to \u201cdump\u201d the Trump name. Kelly said she was among the signatories. \u201cFor the whole time I have lived here I have apologized for the name on the building,\u201d she said. I\u2019ve explained it as: \u2018We\u2019re not necessarily fans but it\u2019s a great place to live.\u2019 \u201cBut when he launched his campaign and referred to Mexican immigrants as rapists it got really serious for me. \u201cEvery taxi I got into, every playdate my child had, whenever I was giving people directions I was very clear about: \u2018It\u2019s just a name on the building, he has nothing to do with it, it was a real estate deal from 15 years ago, and please know that he has zero connection to our philosophy as humans.\u2019\u201d Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, did not respond to a request for comment."
"5||The Clinton minority: upstate New York's Democrats keep support low key\u201cThere\u2019s one other person in town with a Clinton sign,\u201d Link Oberg, 30, said, staring across the main street in Downsville, New York, at a phalanx of yard signs promoting Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Republican John Faso\u2019s congressional re-election campaign. \u201cDid you talk to her?\u201d I am in Downsville, population 633, where the motto is: \u201cThe best town on a dam site!\u201d and where Trump signs dot the well-kept yards. (One Trump supporter, though, inked out the \u201cT\u201d and the \u201cP\u201d on one of the signs, offering neighbors the slogan \u201cRUM: Make America Great Again\u201d. It stood next to a Gadsden-inspired flag advocating for gun rights.) Oberg, who answered the door in a throwback Army of Darkness T-shirt, grew up in a liberal household. \u201cThe sign was my mother\u2019s idea,\u201d she said of the family\u2019s Clinton-Kaine yard sign, adding she was of the \u201canyone-but-Trump mindset. But no one\u2019s harassed us about it or anything.\u201d Up the road in the town of Walton, Jody Jamieson\u2019s house had signs both for Clinton and for Faso\u2019s opponent, Zephyr Teachout, in the yard of her house on a corner far from main road. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly a Clinton supporter,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m voting against Donald Trump.\u201d Two doors down, her neighbors had a Trump-Pence flag where their American flag used to be; on that main road, Delaware Street, a cash-for-gold business proudly displayed the candidate\u2019s signs out front. Jamieson, who is 60, moved to Walton from Oklahoma with her husband, a native of the town who had moved away to attend college, where they\u2019d met. Like Oberg, she said she was one of two Clinton supporters in her town of 5,484 residents. The other is her son. The Clinton yard sign represents something of a shift for Jamieson, who has been a registered Republican for 30 years. \u201cI can no longer identify myself as a member of the Republican party that nominated Donald Trump,\u201d she said. After the election, she plans to change her party registration to Democrat; under New York state law, one must file notice of intent to change parties 25 days before a general election, and it only goes into effect after election day. \u201cIt took Donald Trump to do that.\u201d East of Walton, there are more Democrats in the village of Delhi (pronounced \u201cdell-high\u201d by locals) than some of the other places in Delaware County. The village, population 3,023, is home to the State University of New York at Delhi, a 2,000-student school with a focus on technological academic programs. Roger and Susan Hillstrom, who are in their mid-70s, moved to Delhi nearly 30 years ago from New York City (and aren\u2019t yet considered true locals). But they\u2019ve found the village welcoming and many of their friends and neighbors are fairly liberal, even if there aren\u2019t as many Clinton signs on display in the village as in their yard. \u201cMost of our street is Democratic,\u201d said Roger. \u201cAnd in 2008 and 2012, President Obama carried this town\u201d \u2013 though he noted that registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats in the county. (Statewide about 30% of New Yorkers don\u2019t register with a party affiliation.) \u201cWe have a strong Democratic group in this town,\u201d added Susan, who said another woman organized it to support Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s first Senate campaign. Now they get together regularly to talk about candidates \u2013 they\u2019ve helped elect two Democrats to the village board \u2013 and register voters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re super organized,\u201d said Roger, \u201cbut we do get together and support candidates.\u201d They haven\u2019t heard much from their neighbors about their Clinton and Teachout yard signs. \u201cNobody\u2019s defaced them,\u201d said Roger, sounding horrified by the idea. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about vandalism,\u201d said Susan. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure I believe it.\u201d Both Hillstroms have friends who are supporting Trump, some vociferously, as well as those supporting Clinton. \u201cThis is a good community, Delhi, in supporting each other on a personal level,\u201d said Susan. \u201cIt\u2019s strong that way and maybe it kept us from being too terrible.\u201d Added Roger: \u201cWe all have the politeness not to go crazy with each other.\u201d"
"6||Turkish opposition condemns arrest of Kurdish officialsTurkey\u2019s opposition parties have condemned the arrests of a dozen Kurdish officials including senior politicians in a terror investigation, branding it an affront to democracy amid mounting outrage by Ankara\u2019s western allies. The Turkish lira fell to a three-month low against the dollar over fears of instability after midnight raids led to the detention of the two chiefs of the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic party (HDP) and at least 10 other party members, whom the government accuses of abetting the activities of Kurdish insurgents. Among the detainees was Selahattin Demirta\u0219, the charismatic Kurdish politician and an opponent of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u201cYou can never bring peace to a country if you say, \u2018I will apprehend those who came with elections, jail them, kill them, destroy them, shoot them and silence them in mafia-like ways,\u2019\u201d said Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, the head of the Republican People\u2019s party (CHP), the largest opposition bloc in parliament. \u201cIf you defend democracy, then you should recognise that those who come to power with elections should go with elections,\u201d he added in a speech on Friday. \u201cIf not, you will slaughter democracy.\u201d The HDP denounced the arrests, saying the \u201cdignity of justice\u201d was compromised in what the party sees as a politically motivated smear campaign. It called on the international community to respond to what it described as a coup by Erdo\u011fan. The detentions came against a backdrop of rising tensions in Turkey, months after a coup attempt in July shook the nation and prompted a broad purge of thousands of police officers, teachers, academics, army personnel and journalists accused of having links to Fethullah G\u00fclen, a US-based preacher Ankara says masterminded the putsch. A simultaneous crackdown has also targeted prominent Kurdish personalities and media organisations that the government accuses of fomenting propaganda on behalf of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), a separatist group that has carried out attacks in Turkey and is designated as a terror group by the US. Peace talks between the PKK and the government collapsed last year in mutual recrimination, and violence has since flared up repeatedly in Kurdish areas in the south-east of the country. Hours after the detentions began, the city of Diyarbak\u0131r was rocked by a car bomb outside a police building in attack the authorities blamed on PKK militants. At least nine people were killed and more than 100 injured in the attack in the majority-Kurdish city. In a statement, the Turkish government said the detentions had been carried out after HDP MPs refused to testify in a terror probe. HDP is the third-largest party in the 550-seat Turkish parliament, with 59 seats. Parliamentarians in Turkey normally enjoy immunity from prosecution, but that privilege was lifted earlier this year in a measure widely seen as targeting the HDP. The prime minister, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, told reporters that elected officials who incite and encourage terrorism must face legal proceedings and that the MPs were detained because they had refused to give testimony. \u201cPolitics cannot be a shield for committing a crime,\u201d Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said. \u201cTurkey is a state of law.\u201d \u201cThose who come to power by elections but prefer to embrace terrorism will of course be held accountable by the law,\u201d he added. There were reported outages in social media services including Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp throughout Turkey, which the country\u2019s premier said was a security measure. Rights groups and western officials also condemned the arrests. Emma Sinclair-Webb, the Turkey director for Human Rights Watch, described it as an \u201coutrageous step in the draconian crackdown\u201d, and Amnesty International said it was \u201cthe latest escalation in the onslaught on dissent\u201d. The US government said that it was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the arrests, while the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said they compromised Turkey\u2019s parliamentary democracy. \u201cWe expect Turkey to safeguard its parliamentary democracy, including respect for human rights and the rule of law, and we are conveying these expectations directly to the Turkish authorities,\u201d Mogherini said in a statement with the EU\u2019s enlargement commissioner, Johannes Hahn. Germany\u2019s foreign ministry said it had summoned Turkey\u2019s charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires to discuss the arrests. Relations between Turkey and the EU are delicate. Officials in Ankara accuse their European counterparts of not showing enough support for Turkey in the aftermath of the failed coup, and bristle at criticism of the crackdown. Meanwhile, a deal to limit the flight of migrants from Turkey to Europe in exchange for visa-free travel for Turkish citizens in the EU may fail in the coming weeks because Europe has not kept its end of the bargain. A measure to reintroduce the death penalty in Turkey is also likely to be debated in the coming weeks in parliament, likely to end Turkey\u2019s EU accession talks. Turkey remains under a state of emergency, imposed after the failed coup attempt, which critics say has gone well beyond targeting the plotters. Thirteen staff from the opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper, including the editor-in-chief, were detained on Monday, further heightening strains in Turkish society. Opponents of Erdo\u011fan are likely to interpret the latest developments in the campaign as a move to further consolidate his power ahead of an expected referendum and parliamentary vote in the spring on constitutional amendments that would transform Turkey from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system."
"3||Highland Reel can land Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf for dominant Aidan O\u2019Brien yardThe star names in Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s team for the second day of the Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting at Santa Anita seem sure to play a central role in many punters\u2019 betting plans on Saturday, and Found, the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe winner, is likely to be the most important name of all as she makes what may well be the final start of her career in the Turf. And on the face of it Found looks as bankable as they come. She is the top-rated performer in the field, beat the Derby winner Golden Horn to land the same contest 12 months ago, and her overall profile is that of a horse who delivers her best form, at the highest level, over and over again. \u201cTough and highly durable\u201d is Timeform\u2019s assessment of Found, which is, if anything, doing her a disservice. Her last seven starts have all been at Group One level and Found has finished first or second in all seven. She is far from an odds-on chance in the betting, however, and there are some good reasons why. Flintshire, who started his career with Andr\u00e9 Fabre but is now the best middle-distance turf horse in the States, should be a very tough opponent even if he does need to bounce back from a disappointing run \u2013 on good-to-soft ground - last time out. Found\u2019s stable companion Highland Reel, the King George winner, was also less than two lengths behind her in the Arc, while it is also hard to overlook the fact that, for all her consistency, only one of those seven Group One runs this year actually resulted in a victory. Perhaps the most significant concern, though, is the likely speed of the turf track here on Saturday. The turf was relaid in the summer and, while it is always quick in California, there is a consensus that this year, it could be faster than ever. Found does have some form on fast ground and it was good-to-firm when she took the Arc but turf as firm as it is likely to be this weekend is an unknown. The good news from O\u2019Brien\u2019s point of view, however, is that Highland Reel (10.22pm) is both high-class and versatile and perhaps a horse, too, whose form has not received quite the credit it deserves. He took two Group Ones outside Europe as a three-year-old, winning both at Arlington Park in Chicago and Sha Tin in Hong Kong, and the ground was very quick for his run at Arlington in particular. A well-run 12 furlongs on firm ground could be just what he needs, Seamie Heffernan has proved time and again that he is an excellent No2 jockey and Highland Reel makes plenty of appeal at around 7-2 (and quite possibly a bigger price on the US Tote). O\u2019Brien was noticeably keen this week to stress how much he is looking forward to seeing Washington DC (9.05pm) in the Turf Sprint and the red-hot pace should set the race up for Ryan Moore to deliver a late challenge. His Falmouth Stakes winner Alice Springs, however, may struggle to cope with Limato (11.40pm) in the Mile, as Henry Candy\u2019s gelding seems tailor-made for the challenge. Sir Michael Stoute seemed a little cool on the chance of Ulysses in the Turf earlier this week but perked up considerably when discussing Queen\u2019s Trust (7.43pm) in the Filly &amp; Mare Turf and she could be another British-trained winner if she can get a little more luck than in several of her recent starts. For American fans, meanwhile, the highlight of the week will be California Chrome\u2019s attempt to add the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic to a career record which already includes the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and the Dubai World Cup in seven Grade One wins. Arrogate, a wide-margin winner in a track record time last time out, is a new challenge for Art Sherman\u2019s outstanding five-year-old but California Chrome (12.35am) has continued to improve as he has matured and he should deliver the victory that many in the huge Santa Anita crowd will be desperate to see. Haveyougoneaway (11.01pm) has a live chance in the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint for Tom Morley, whose late uncle David was a multiple Group One winner in Britain. Union Strike (7.05pm) and Drefong (8.21pm) are the picks at the prices in the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 and Sprint respectively, while the front-running Syndergaard (9.43pm) may just have enough to win a very tight renewal of the Juvenile. Selections: 7.05 Union Strike 7.43 Queen\u2019s Trust 8.21 Drefong 9.05 Washington DC 9.43 Syndergaard 10.22 Highland Reel (nap) 11.01 Haveyougoneaway 11.40 Limato 12.35 California Chrome"
"10||MDMA may pose greater danger to women than men, say scientistsWomen are more likely to end up in emergency rooms than men after taking ecstasy, scientists say, with research suggesting this may because of the way the drug interacts with the body\u2019s chemistry. According to this year\u2019s Global Drugs Survey, there has been a four-fold increase in British female clubbers seeking emergency medical treatment after taking MDMA in last three years, and women are now two to three times more likely to seek emergency treatment than men. Dr Adam Winstock, the founder of the Global Drugs Survey that investigates drug use habits, said that gender differences in the effects of the drug were becoming increasingly clear. \u201cWhat I would say to female ecstasy users is that you need to more careful than men,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen appear to be more at risk of harm. Everyone has to be careful, but I think women need to pay extra attention to things like how much they are using, how they are mixing, where they are and who they\u2019re with.\u201d One theory is that MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy, causes users\u2019 bodies to retain more water, which in some cases can lead to dangerous brain swelling. Oestrogen, the female hormone, impairs cells\u2019 ability to release water, meaning that women are particularly at risk from the effect. The warnings come after 10 young women died this year having taken ecstasy pills or MDMA powder \u2013 more than double the number last year \u2013 as high-strength products swamp the market after a drought that lasted several years. The effects of MDMA doses are less predictable than other drugs, Winstock said. Even a small dose could, in the wrong set of circumstances, kill a user. However, he was keen to stress that the risk posed by the drug could be minimised by careful use. With an estimated 200,000 Britons using ecstasy every weekend, overstating the harms of the drug was simply not realistic, he said. Fiona Measham, a professor of criminology at Durham University, said that whereas previous deaths linked to ecstasy were the result of adulterated pills, problems now were more likely to be the result of users accidentally taking more MDMA than they intended. Measham is the founder of the drug-testing charity The Loop, which checks the strength and content of drugs handed in by users at nightclubs and festivals across the UK. She said: \u201cWith ecstasy-related deaths approaching the highest they have ever been, alongside some of the highest and most variable strength ecstasy pills in circulation, it\u2019s more important than ever this coming party season to take extra care.\u201d"
"0||Iceland Airwaves festival day two \u2013 the rappers come out in force, but rock steals the dayFor Iceland, 2016 is the year that rap broke. Noting that one of the themes dominating this year\u2019s Iceland Airwaves festival is Icelandic hip-hop, an article in the Reykjavik Grapevine, amusingly titled Get Rich or Freeze Tryin, lists some of the acts worth looking out for. It has also coined the acronym Nwoihh, for the New Wave of Icelandic Hip-Hop. Day two kicks off with a variety of intriguing new rap acts, starting with Au\u00f0ur, who is said to perform \u201csmudged R&amp;B\u201d. He\u2019s the Icelandic Weeknd, basically, only blond, offering a slight spin on the genre by strumming an electric guitar as he croons sadly about the sorrowful travails of the high life, like Ed Sheeran shambling uninvited into The Party &amp; the After Party. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t quite have the charisma to pull off quiet depravity in the way Abel Tesfaye does, and he\u2019s too keen to telegraph his moral dissolution by saying \u201cfuck\u201d every other word over his slow, torturous soul. \u201cI wanna be alone tonight,\u201d he sings, and he probably will be. Lord Pu$$whip keeps things dark and brooding, with his take on eerie, codeine-groggy, grinding hip-hop. Through the stoned fog you can just about make out the phrase \u201cmotherfucking kr\u00f3na\u201d, and the success of this music beyond these shores is likely to depend on listeners\u2019 preparedness to accept such parochial twists on rap\u2019s established vernacular. \u00dalfur \u00dalfur, starring Arnar and Helgi, are the most highly touted of Iceland\u2019s rappers. They make a smooth virtue out of the consonant-heavy language, helped by some catchy beats and slipping into English only for their between-song crowd interactions (\u201cMake some noise!\u201d etc). For all the buzz around them, there is a lot of chatter as they play: maybe people are wondering aloud what the current plethora of rising rappers says about Iceland today. Raising more questions, and inviting a perfect storm of amazement and ridicule, are Krakk &amp; Spaghetti, two pink-haired female rappers and a laptop operator, who apparently started out by competing in a contest to write and perform the worst song. In a brightly lit skiwear store, the hyperactive pair perform their set of fun-size novelty ditties, one of them wearing red trousers, the other in a purple parka so tacky you\u2019d swear she was subversively trying to reclaim Icelandic white trash or something. In fact, they have a song called H\u00f3ra Kap\u00edtalismans (Capitalist\u2019s Whore). Then again, they have another entitled Spenfrelsi, which means Nipple Freedom, so it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. With their comically fast flow and squeaky cartoon voices, they\u2019re pinky and perky, punky and quirky. \u201cWe\u2019re all total buffoons,\u201d they declared recently. \u201cAnd we want to add more silliness to the Icelandic music scene.\u201d Job done. As well as rap, there are a lot of polished, atmospheric electronic acts with powerful warbling female voices at this year\u2019s Airwaves. Probably too many. It used to be a scarce resource, now there is the opposite problem: how to rise above this morass of accomplished \u201cpolitetronicists\u201d? Still, the venue down by the sea is rammed for V\u00f6k, with their male/female configuration and pleasantly pallid xx/Poli\u00e7a-style pop. Downstairs in a bar along the same road, Iris gives good bewitching over glitchy post-dubstep beats and goth-tinged melodies; aural dry ice suffused with Icelandic mythos. Over at the Harpa concert hall and conference centre, Iceland\u2019s Bedroom Community record label has been joined by the Iceland Symphony Orchestra for an evening of neo-classical music based on versions of the indie collective\u2019s output. To these untrained ears, it just sounds like a glorious amalgam of Gregorian chants and strings of panoramic, cinematic sweep worthy of a Spielberg movie, all watched over by BC founder members Ben Frost, Nico Muhly and Valgeir Sigur\u00f0sson. Good sound, too \u2013 hardly surprising given the environs, a four-tiered building that makes the Royal Albert Hall look like CBGBs. Another auspicious venue is Reykjavik\u2019s art museum, where Julia Holter is playing. Here, however, the high ceilings conspire against the generally excellent Holter in terms of acoustics. But her music is also let down by her supposed allies: the double bass and violin work, but the drums are plodding and the saxophone drowns out her light ululations. And her material, seemingly designed to take flight, is frustratingly tethered. Where Holter is experimental, Hannah Lou Clark is a husky alt-rocking throwback, in the nicest possible way: it\u2019s actually something of a relief to hear a musician and a band without any electronics. With a mainly female outfit (save for the token bloke drummer), she plays a set that flits between 80s AOR and the Breeders/Belly/Throwing Muses 90s college-rock axis. The penultimate place I visit tonight is like Heaven \u2013 the London club, not the abstract paradise. Here, Belgium-based Congolese rapper Baloji \u2013 a tall, charismatic fellow in a wide-brimmed hat that makes him vaguely resemble a wild west preacher \u2013 does his thing, fusing ragga and funk. Grinning, pogoing and grabbing his crotch, he puts in a high-energy performance, eliciting some risque dancing from the crowd. After midnight, the Sonics \u2013 the godfathers of all that White Stripes-type pseudo-primitive rock action, and the only act name-checked more than once in the classic hipster mantra Losing My Edge by LCD Soundsystem \u2013 put on a great garage rock show. Their guitar menace is enhanced by their matching dark suits, white shirts and black ties: they look like the Hives\u2019 cool granddads. Against a backdrop of 50s and 60s cult arcana \u2013 Russ Meyer movies, greasers on ton-up motorcycles assailing \u201cthe squares\u201d \u2013 they play a heady mixture of proto-punk and crude, minimalist R&amp;B that\u2019s so good it makes you realise they deserved that double mention in Losing My Edge. Paul Lester\u2019s trip to Iceland was paid for by Iceland Airwaves."
"6||MoD seriously misled me on Saudi arms sales, says Vince CableThe Ministry of Defence has been accused of \u201cseriously misleading\u201d a cabinet minister in a desperate effort to get export licences for British-made missiles for use by Saudi Arabia in its controversial bombing campaign in Yemen. The former business secretary Vince Cable has told the Guardian he was given specific assurances by the MoD about oversight of potential targets \u2013 which he deemed an essential safeguard to minimise the risk of civilian casualties in the increasingly bloody conflict. He says he was told that the UK would enhance its oversight to the level given by the Saudis to the US \u2013 which would include involvement in decisions about what was being bombed. It was on this basis, Cable says, that he agreed to sign licences for a consignment of laser-guided Paveway IV missiles, which he had blocked amid concerns about civilian deaths. However, the MoD has told the Guardian it has no military personnel in the \u201ctargeting chain\u201d, and has denied ever offering Cable such assurances last year. Cable said: \u201cThat is categorically contrary to what I was told was going to happen. If what they are now saying [is] I was not offered oversight on an equivalent level to the Americans, and that this would involve oversight of targeting, then I was seriously misled. That is total fabrication because that was very specifically stated. That is not something that I would have made up.\u201d A second source who was involved in the discussions at the time has corroborated Cable\u2019s account. \u201cMr Cable was told we would have oversight of targeting. He wouldn\u2019t have agreed to the licences without this,\u201d the source said. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said: \u201cIt is extremely disturbing to discover the sale of arms for use in Yemen was approved by Vince Cable on the basis of a lie, and it provides yet more evidence that limiting civilian casualties in this conflict has been the least of the government\u2019s concerns. \u201cGiven the MoD have now confirmed they have no control over what the Saudi airstrikes are targeting, any notion that Britain is acting as a restraining force on the coalition forces is plain nonsense.\u201d The sale of British-made arms to Saudi Arabia has been under scrutiny for months because of Riyadh\u2019s role in Yemen\u2019s civil war. The kingdom has led a coalition of Middle Eastern countries to push back against the Houthi militia, now in control of much of the country. Saudi Arabia has spearheaded the bombing in Yemen \u2013 raising concerns that UK weapons may have been used in airstrikes that resulted in civilian casualties. Earlier this year, the UN said 119 coalition attacks had breached international humanitarian law, with many involving \u201cmultiple airstrikes on multiple civilian objects\u201d such as hospitals, schools, factories and homes. With concern about civilian deaths growing last year, Cable suspended the sale of Paveway bombs to the Saudi royal air force. He said he would not approve the licences until the MoD agreed extra safeguards to minimise the risk of UK missiles causing casualties. The suspension caused uproar within the MoD, the Foreign Office and Downing Street. The Guardian has been told David Cameron, then prime minister, called his deputy, Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, to ask him why Cable was dragging his feet. Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, and Philip Hammond, then foreign secretary, also lobbied for the immediate resumption of sales, according to Whitehall sources. \u201cThe MoD was desperate to get the licences signed,\u201d said one source. \u201cThe Saudis were putting enormous pressure on the government, and this hold-up was extremely embarrassing. They\u2019d already told the Saudis: \u2018This stuff is coming.\u2019 And then it got held up and they couldn\u2019t explain to the Saudis what was going on.\u201d Another source added: \u201cThe Saudis are extremely important to us, both as a customer but also in strategic terms in the region. The bottom line is, if we don\u2019t sell these arms to them, someone else will.\u201d Cable says he was told there were \u201caircraft on the runway\u201d waiting to fly to Saudi Arabia with fresh supplies. In the end, Cable says he agreed to sign the export licences, but only after the MoD had offered to beef up its oversight of Saudi targeting to the levels afforded to the Americans. He said he was told the US had oversight of what Saudi Arabia intended to target, and \u201cfinal say-so\u201d if it saw anything untoward. \u201cMy very clear understanding was that the equipment would be supplied to Saudi Arabia on the very clear basis that British personnel would have oversight of what the Saudi air force was doing, on the same basis as the Americans,\u201d Cable said. The MoD told the Guardian while it had agreed to \u201cincrease oversight of the targeting process\u201d last year, this did not actually involve oversight of targeting at any stage. The MoD said its liaison officers \u201care not embedded with the Saudis. [They] do not provide training, they do not provide advice on IHL [international humanitarian law] compliance, and they have no role in the Saudi targeting chain. \u201cBritish personnel are not involved in carrying out strikes, directing or conducting operations in Yemen or selecting targets and are not involved in the Saudi targeting decision-making process.\u201d The MoD refused to say what had actually changed as a result of Cable\u2019s demands. \u201cWe won\u2019t go into details,\u201d said a spokesman. A defence source said it was untrue to say the Americans could effectively veto targets. Anna MacDonald, director of the Control Arms coalition, said it appeared the MoD had \u201ceither pulled the wool over the eyes of the minister, or were themselves extraordinarily naive\u201d. She added: \u201cEither way, these arms deals should not have been approved, and Yemenis are paying the price with their lives.\u201d"
"8||The vicious assault on UK judges by the Brexit press is a threat to democracyThe Brexit-supporting press has mounted a vicious assault on the three high court judges who ruled in the article 50 case. And it has undermined our constitution in the process. The government appears to be fuelling this attack. Sajid Javid, the local government secretary, described the judges as seeking to \u201cthwart the will of the people\u201d. The judiciary is a pillar of our constitution. Allow faith in the judges to be eroded and that pillar is eroded at a huge cost to our freedoms. The front page of the Daily Mail labelled the three judges \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. It described Sir Terence Etherton as the first \u201copenly gay\u201d judge, detailed Sir Philip Sales\u2019 earnings when he was a barrister and worked for the government and captioned a photograph of the third judge \u201cThe Europhile: Lord Chief Justice Thomas\u201d. The Sun and the Daily Telegraph stooped to spraying abuse with the same lack of concern for the constitutional place of the judiciary in our democracy. Our judges do not do politics. They do law. They are selected to be judges on their legal ability. Their political allegiance is irrelevant and plays no part in their selection \u2013 which is not, for example, the case in the US. The judges of the American supreme court, when confronted with the choice of Al Gore or George Bush in the 2000 election, which was contested in the courts, each came down on the side of the party that had nominated them. So Bush won because there were more Republican-nominated judges than Democratic. One of the things that has made the UK such a strong player in the global economy is that politics does not affect the rule of law or the decisions of our courts. This attracts business to the UK, because people know court rulings will not be influenced by politics. The British public continues to have confidence in the independence and quality of judges. But both are undermined by this Brexit-inspired media vitriol. The attitude of the Brexiters seems to be: who cares about constitutional protections such as that which prevents the executive from just removing people\u2019s rights on the prime minister\u2019s say-so, and undermining casually the authority of judges? It is intensely damaging and sets up yet another conflict: judges against the people. We must leave the EU in accordance with the referendum vote. But we must take care not to damage our constitutional framework in the process. Democracy and the rule of law are the two pillars of our constitution. There is very little doubt, when you read this judgment, that the judges have loyally obeyed their judicial oath and decided the case in accordance with the law and the facts. The principle that citizens have legal rights that cannot be taken away on the say-so of the executive without parliamentary authority was not in dispute. The question the judges had to decide was the extent to which rights given by the European Communities Act of 1972 were an exception to that principle. The court concluded unsurprisingly that these rights, which had been incorporated into our domestic law, weren\u2019t an exception, and they cited previous cases stretching back decades, which made that clear. The ruling did not say there should be no Brexit or that Brexit should be delayed, but that Brexit must be done constitutionally not unconstitutionally. As a piece of legal reasoning it is firmly rooted both in accepted principle and decided cases. The decision reaffirms well known principles and applies them to Brexit in an authoritative way. Yet the quality and impartiality of the judgment appears to cut no ice with either the Brexit media or some elements of the government. We trust our judges to uphold the law and the constitution impartially. This impartiality depends on judges not expressing views, so they can\u2019t defend themselves. That\u2019s why the government has an obligation to defend them and why the constitution places a duty on the lord chancellor to do so. The government needs to make it clear that they dissociate themselves from these attacks and come to the defence of the judges. Ministers need to make it clear that they do not doubt for one minute either the integrity of the three judges, or that the judges have given what they believe to be the correct answer. They should make it clear that the judges have in no way acted undemocratically or in opposition to the people, and that attacks on their integrity and attempts to undermine them personally are factually unfounded and undermine our country. There is a world of difference between judicial decisions that have political consequences, as this one does, and decisions that are motivated by wanting a political outcome \u2013 which this one is not. To create a sense that the government is at odds with the judiciary and that judges are somehow in a different political camp from the government is both wrong and damaging. The lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has a constitutional duty to defend the judges. She needs to make it clear immediately that the government has no quarrel with the judges and has total confidence in them. Disagreement with the judges is dealt with by appeal not by abuse. So far Truss has been completely silent, no doubt waiting for guidance from a prime minister who appears so mesmerised by the fear of what the public may do or think that she is willing to throw constitutional propriety overboard. Truss\u2019s silence feeds the sense that the government is either hopeless at avoiding conflict or couldn\u2019t care less about the constitution."
"3||England get a genteel welcome to India but spin trials will not be so tranquilEngland tiptoed on to the most genteel patch of cricketing turf in India for their first practice on the second leg of their tour. The training session at the Brabourne Stadium, the home of the Cricket Club of India was, theoretically, optional but everyone attended. It was meant to last two and a half hours, but, having completed all that was required, a group decision to practise some more was reached. And so they did. While we can quibble about the quality of some of England\u2019s play on the tour, there can be no complaints about their commitment. The setting will not be so tranquil from Monday onwards when England will be practising in Rajkot before the first Test starts there on Wednesday. But here all was decorous. On the outfield next to the nets there was even a portable green cubicle, sadly underused by the England players, with a sign delicately painted upon it saying: \u201cPlease change here\u201d. This was old India, where the players might be requested to put on their thigh pads out of sight of passers-by. A few old members, who might have attended England\u2019s last Test on this ground \u2013 in 1973, when Tony Lewis was captain \u2013 took their daily exercise, perambulating briskly around the outfield, bemused rather than perplexed when England began their session with the routinely raucous game of football. Inside the pavilion the helicopter fans rotated gently to augment a zephyr of a breeze coming in from the Arabian Sea and there was a chance to glimpse faded, grey photos of Bedi and Chandrasekhar, Prasanna and Venkat, as well as Colin and Tom, Alec and Geoffrey. Outside there were possible portents of things to come. Was it relevant that Gary Ballance was not among the group of six batsmen who started in the nets? Instead he sat under an umbrella out of the sun, chatting to Trevor Bayliss and Ben Stokes. Meanwhile, the quicks, though not required to bowl, were put through their paces by the trainers and it was noticeable that Stokes was not among them. Clearly his energies must be preserved at all costs; he would do more than bat. The new chairman of Durham would have been impressed that Stokes was able to have an officially sanctioned light load at practice, something that Sir Ian Botham often had to achieve by his own devices all those years ago. The emphasis was upon batting against spin and several locals of all shapes and sizes had been summoned up alongside Moeen Ali, Gareth Batty, Zafar Ansari and Adil Rashid, only one of whom \u2013 Moeen \u2013 is guaranteed to play in the Rajkot Test. They all bowled under the watchful eye of Saqlain Mushtaq, one-third of the latest influx of coaches now Paul Farbrace and Bruce French, the wicketkeeping coach, are here as well. Joe Root knows the score. He is one of three batsmen to have played a Test in India before (Alastair Cook and Jonny Bairstow being the others). Four years ago on a startlingly successful tour, Root was the novice rather brilliantly selected for his debut Test in the final game in Nagpur, a draw that secured an away series win. Now he is England\u2019s vice-captain and, like Cook, a source of wisdom to the others, who must be wondering what is in store for them over the next seven weeks \u2013 though it appears likely that Rohit Sharma, the India opening batsman, will now miss the entire series. \u201cIt\u2019s gone so quickly,\u201d said Root after England\u2019s prolonged session. \u201cYet paradoxically it seems a long time ago. I\u2019ve done a lot of growing up since. There have been a lot of personnel changes in the dressing room. That was a fantastic tour, a really enjoyable one and it would be great to emulate that now.\u201d The challenges have not changed much in four years even if the England team has, except that Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are better bowlers now. \u201cWe respect them,\u201d said Root. \u201cBut we must not fear them.\u201d Once again England must learn to combat spin bowling. \u201cOver the next couple of days we\u2019re going to have to work really hard on making sure we have the methods to play spin well, to score well against it and to have an adequate defence,\u201d said the old soldier Root. \u201cThe way the guys practised today was a good start leading into this tour.\u201d The batsmen have to learn to think on their feet and trust their own methods. There is no right answer as Ben Duckett and Cook demonstrated in their century opening partnership in Dhaka. \u201cYou never know what the surface is going to be like in Rajkot,\u201d said Root. \u201cIt might be similar [to Bangladesh]. It might be completely different. It might be flat for the first few days, then that skill of playing on a turning wicket comes in down the line.\u201d No one knows for certain how the pitch will play in Rajkot, which hosts its first Test match, but everyone from the old boys at the Brabourne stopping for a fresh lime soda after their walk to the wide-eyed Haseeb Hameed potentially taking guard there for the first time, will be amazed if there is a blade of green grass visible when the series gets under way on Wednesday."

"23||Book reviews roundup: London Lies Beneath; The Invention of Angela Carter; A Day in the Life of the BrainReviewers were struck by the characterisation in London Lies Beneath, a novel based on a real event in 1912. \u201cStella Duffy\u2019s masterly novel tells the tale of a group of boy scouts who drown on a camping expedition down the River Thames,\u201d wrote Max Davidson in the Mail on Sunday. \u201cDuffy, without over-egging the pudding, wrings every ounce of pathos from their story. Her feeling for working-class London at its most resourceful \u2026 shines through the book.\u201d Francesca Angelini in the Sunday Times was less convinced, arguing that \u201cDuffy does little to distinguish the individuals who, never complaining but always striving, morph into flat caricatures \u2026 Her characters feel secondary to the backdrop, but even the city struggles to come to life through the thick tar of romanticised ideology overlaying it.\u201d But other reviewers were fans, with the Sunday Mirror\u2019s Deirdre O\u2019Brien impressed by \u201chauntingly beautiful prose\u201d and the Financial Times\u2019s Laura Garmeson finding the writing \u201cas dense and vivid as the city itself \u2026 Sprawling and unruly, but full of heart, Duffy\u2019s new novel is a fitting hymn to the city that inspired it.\u201d Powerful prose is celebrated in Edmund Gordon\u2019s The Invention of Angela Carter, published 24 years after Carter\u2019s death and making full use of her journals and correspondence. Reviewers praised it as a thorough and sensitive job. Gordon is \u201cattuned to Carter\u2019s wit\u201d, found Gaby Wood in the Daily Telegraph, and \u201cthe details he picks out suggest he has learnt how to see the world her way\u201d. Some found the structure disappointingly conventional, with the Observer\u2019s Rachel Cooke saying it left \u201clittle room for its subject\u2019s iconoclasm, for the intellectual wildness that colours every line she ever wrote\u201d, and the Literary Review\u2019s Lucy Hughes-Hallett calling it \u201cjust one damn thing after another \u2026 Its substance, though, glints with well-placed detail and witty aper\u00e7us, and it pays proper attention to what matters most, Angela Carter\u2019s writing.\u201d She summarised that it is \u201cthe most valuable kind of literary biography \u2013 the kind that sends you back to the subject\u2019s work\u201d. Gordon was able to get into his subject\u2019s head, but Susan Greenfield attempts to get into consciousness itself in her new book, A Day in the Life of the Brain. \u201cThankfully, after a number of books in which Greenfield claimed \u2013 without any convincing evidence \u2013 that our technologies were changing human brains for the worse, she is back in the realm of normal, empirical science,\u201d wrote Anil Ananthaswamy in the New Scientist. \u201cHer new book, while flawed, is a definite improvement on its predecessors \u2026 Her writing is clear, sharp, devoid of difficult jargon and chatty. The brain\u2019s complexity comes across vividly, and its achievements are a marvel.\u201d Barbara Kiser in Nature magazine explained: \u201cNeuroscientist Susan Greenfield investigates consciousness from waking to sleeping, drawing on her own research \u2026 and that of myriad other scientists\u201d, and called the result \u201can illuminating, engrossing journey into (and beyond) the biology of time, the synergism of walking and cognition, and the phylogeny of dreams\u201d. As the intelligent layman on the case, the Sunday Times\u2019s John Carey advised: \u201cGreenfield aims her book at the \u2018general reader\u2019, but hers is a tough subject and this is a tough read. Persevere and you will be rewarded with a vivid glimpse into the brainstretching difficulty of making advances in brain research.\u201d"
"0||Jay Z (and maybe Beyonc\u00e9) spearhead final anti-Trump musical pushWith the candidates almost neck and neck in the most alarming presidential election in living memory, musicians are making a final push to get out the vote. On Friday night, Jay Z will join Hillary Clinton for a free concert at the Wolstein Center, in Cleveland, Ohio \u2013 an event that\u2019s rumored to also include Beyonc\u00e9, his wife. With Donald Trump leading polls in Ohio, the Clinton campaign aims to use this superstar power to get millennials to vote. As if in preparation, Jay Z tweeted a quote by Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel earlier this week about the necessity of speaking out at times of emergency, adding: \u201cLet\u2019s make history (again).\u201d Then there\u2019s the final stages of 30 Days, 30 Songs, an independent project in support of defeating Trump, which is on its final strait. Created by writer Dave Eggers, the daily, evolving playlist steadily releases new and previously unreleased music from independent musical voices all in favor of a Trump-free America, with proceeds going to the Center for Popular Democracy and its efforts to achieve universal voter registration. The playlist launched with several big-name releases, including a never-before-released live version of World Leader Pretend by REM; a new Death Cab For Cutie effort called Million Dollar Loan; two Moby collaborations, one with the Homeland Choir (Trump Is on Your Side) and the other with the Void Pacific Choir (Little Failure); plus, most strikingly, a Franz Ferdinand number, Demagogue, that very bluntly takes jabs at Trump\u2019s narcissism, hollow promises and ego. Recently there\u2019s been a Bob Mould jam, a live version of his old band H\u00fcsker D\u00fc\u2019s In Free Land. Released in 1982, its sardonic lyrics \u2013 \u201cWhy bother spending time/ Reading up on things/ Everybody\u2019s an authority/ In a free land\u201d \u2013 resonate even more loudly in the current era of noisy, post-truth politics. Guster singer and guitarist Ryan Miller takes a different tack with a whimsical, circus-themed track titled The Clown. Its lyrics, by Eggers, take in Trump\u2019s \u201corange face\u201d and \u201ccotton candy hair\u201d, concluding that the Republican nominee is a \u201cwounded little boy, a boy dressed as a man\u201d. The playlist will also include a live rendition of Local Natives track Fountain of Youth, a youth empowerment song that according to the band\u2019s vocalist and guitarist Taylor Rice \u201ccouldn\u2019t feel more apt for this moment. On one side of this debate, there is a deep distrust and cynicism, a disregard for the humanity of many. The younger generations know that this is not the world they see.\u201d \u201cIf music can play even a small role in reminding people to get out there and vote, then we have to do everything we can,\u201d says Superchunk singer-guitarist Mac McCaughan, who contributed to a cover of Woody Guthrie\u2019s Old Man Trump. The godfather of the American protest song wrote the number excoriating Trump\u2019s father Fred for his reluctance to rent houses to African Americans. Ryan Harvey, Ani DiFranco and Tom Morello also recently covered the song. \u201cThis election matters a great deal,\u201d says Corin Tucker of Sleater-Kinney, who contributed the song Despierta with Peter Buck of REM. \u201cEvery single vote will matter to the future of this country. We can\u2019t let the presidency go to Donald Trump, someone so racist, sexist and incredibly unqualified to be commander-in-chief.\u201d The 30 Days, 30 Songs project is only one outlet for today\u2019s politically driven music. Common\u2019s new album, Black America Again, released onFriday, is a powerful and furious look at racial tension and institutional racism. \u201cInstitution ain\u2019t just a building,\u201d Common spits in Letter to the Free. \u201cWe staring in the face of hate again/ The same hate they say will make America great again.\u201d The video for the album\u2019s title track opens with a clip from the shooting death of Alton Sterling, when Baton Rouge police shot the 37-year-old at close range while held down. (In Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s visual album Lemonade, meanwhile, she takes a bat to a New Orleans police department camera. The state of Louisiana has long exhibited unjust police brutality towards civilians, including the beating of a shackled, bipolar 16-year-old girl caught on camera.) Considering Trump\u2019s degrading and predatory mannerism towards females, and his recents comments that have surfaced, this election is a frightening one for many women. Pussy Riot, some of whose members spent two years in prison for speaking out against Russian president Vladimir Putin, have turned their attentions to the US election: Nadya Tolokonnikova has released a new song called Make America Great Again. The music video portrays a hypothetical take on what would happen to America if Trump were to win, with no Muslims, no Mexicans, no gays and all women forced to look a certain way \u2013 plastic. The band also released a song Straight Outta Vagina, which was recorded in February but still considered to be an \u201canswer to Trump\u201d, and a celebration of female empowerment and sexuality. Californian Rapper YG has also taken aim at Trump with two songs: FDT (Fuck Donald Trump) with Nipsey Hussle and FDT (Fuck Donald Trump) Part 2 with G-Eazy and Macklemore. \u201cHe can\u2019t make decisions for his country, he gon\u2019 crash us,\u201d YG raps. In part two meanwhile, G-Eazy raps: \u201cHow\u2019d he make it this far? How the fuck did it begin?/ A Trump rally sounds like Hitler in Berlin\u201d and goes on to take aim at Trump\u2019s response to the massacre in Orlando: \u201cThe fuck is goin\u2019 on? People just passed/ A mass murder happened, you said thanks for the congrats.\u201d Even Eminem is anti-Trump: the seven-minute, near acapella Campaign Speech including the lyrics: \u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted, a fucking loose cannon who\u2019s blunt with his hand on the button who doesn\u2019t have to answer to no one? Great idea.\u201d Meanwhile, jazz singer-songwriter Norah Jones has peppered her new album, Day Breaks, with political and social references. On the single Flipside, she sings: \u201cYou saw your reflection all over the news/ Your temperature\u2019s well past 102/ Put the guns away, or we\u2019re all gonna lose,\u201d asking the ever unanswerable question: \u201cIf we\u2019re all free, then why does it seem we can\u2019t just be?\u201d \u201cBeing aware of everything that\u2019s going on in the world and watching the news a lot \u2026 it really keeps you up at night,\u201d Jones told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of issues: that\u2019s the problem.\u201d"
"5||Who will be hurt more by a third party 'protest' vote \u2013 Clinton or Trump?Another day closer to the presidential election, another slew of surveys \u2013 most of them showing that Hillary Clinton is in the lead. But the size of the Democratic candidate\u2019s advantage varies considerably from poll to poll, partly because some questionnaires ask voters to consider the fact that there are more than two presidential nominees. Green party candidate Jill Stein is on the ballot in 45 states and voters in another three states can choose to write her name in. And the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is on the ballot in 50 states. Progressives who are feeling turned off by Clinton and/or Donald Trump, the two most unpopular candidates in decades, might be considering a protest vote for one of these other parties (\u201cprotest\u201d in the sense that third-party candidates have a less than 0.1% chance of winning). With just four days to go until the election, they might be wondering who will be hindered more by a protest vote \u2013 Democrat Clinton or Republican Trump? As with all of the articles I have written so far about polling data, the answer is a very unsexy \u201cit depends\u201d. The impact of protest votes varies throughout the country. In total, 33 states can probably be viewed as \u201csafe\u201d states based on the fact that one of the candidates is leading by at least seven percentage points (the numbers are polling averages collected by Real Clear Politics). When analysts talk about the electoral map working in Clinton\u2019s favor, they are referring to the fact that 14 of these states (plus the District of Columbia) look like they\u2019ll vote Democratic and together they\u2019re worth 187 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency. Based on the same threshold of \u201csafe\u201d, Trump can only count on 152 college votes. More importantly, there are 17 states in the US that can be viewed as competitive based on the fact that six percentage points or less separate Clinton and Trump. Some of these states are unlikely to swing the entire election, though, because they don\u2019t have many electoral college votes. Alaska is one such example; although Trump has a narrow lead, the state is only worth three electoral college votes so has little power in changing the national result. Here\u2019s a quick guide to where voting for a third party could affect which of the two main candidates wins. It\u2019s based on a close race (ie places where Clinton and Trump are close in the polls) and state influence (ie 10 electoral college votes or more \u2013 but if the race ends up being very close, the reality will be that every electoral college vote will matter to Trump and Clinton, and states like Iowa and New Hampshire will become important). For voters who consider a Trump win their worst-case scenario, these are states where choosing a third-party candidate could help secure a Republican victory. Florida Number of electoral college votes: 29 Current polling: Clinton is ahead by 1.2 percentage points Detail: Clinton 47.4%, Trump 46.2%, Johnson 2.4%, Stein 1.3% Notes: Early ballots suggest that Hispanic turnout has increased, which is good news for Clinton. Nearly one in five eligible voters in Florida is Hispanic and they typically lean heavily Democrat. Nevertheless, with such razor thin margins, votes in this state for Johnson and Stein that could have gone to Clinton will do real damage to the Democrats nationally. Pennsylvania Number of electoral college votes: 20 Current polling: Clinton is ahead by three percentage points Detail: Clinton 46.8%, Trump 43.8%, Johnson 3.0%, Stein 2.0% Ohio Number of electoral college votes: 18 Current polling: Clinton is ahead by 3.3 percentage points Detail: Clinton 46.3%, Trump 43.0%, Johnson 4.7%, Stein 1.5% Michigan Number of electoral college votes: 16 Current polling: Clinton is ahead by 5.7 percentage points Detail: Clinton 46.0%, Trump 40.3%, Johnson 5.3%, Stein 2.3% Georgia Number of electoral college votes: 16 Current polling: Trump is ahead by 4.8 percentage points Detail: Trump 48.3%, Clinton 43.5%, Johnson 4.3% Notes: The black vote is crucial for Clinton in this state. While 13% of the total US population is black or African American, in Georgia that share is 32% according to the Census Bureau. It looks like Clinton will lose this state, not least because early ballots suggest black turnout has fallen considerably in Georgia. North Carolina Number of electoral college votes: 15 Current polling: Clinton is ahead by two percentage points Detail: Clinton 46.8%, Trump 44.8%, Johnson 3.7%, Stein 0.7% Virginia Number of electoral college votes: 13 Current polling: Clinton is ahead by 5.2 percentage points Detail: Clinton 46.6%, Trump 41.4%, Johnson 4.4%, Stein 1.8% Arizona Number of electoral college votes: 11 Current polling: Trump is ahead by four percentage points Detail: Trump 46.3%, Clinton 42.3%, Johnson 5.0%, Stein 1.8% Wisconsin Number of electoral college votes: 10 Current polling: Clinton is ahead by 5.4 percentage points Detail: Clinton 46.7%, Trump 41.3%, Johnson 5.7%, Stein 2.0% Minnesota Number of electoral college votes: 10 Current polling: Clinton is ahead by six percentage points Detail: Clinton 46.3%, Trump 40.3%, Johnson 5.0%, Stein 1.7%"
"3||Novak Djokovic\u2019s defeat by Cilic opens door for Andy Murray to be world No1Marin Cilic, beaten 14 times in a row by Novak Djokovic over eight frustrating years, broke the Serb\u2019s spell over him in two sets of high anxiety in the quarter-finals of the final masters tournament of the season here on Friday to put the world No1\u2019s 122-week reign in serious jeopardy. Andy Murray, who defeated Tomas Berdych later on Friday, is one win from overtaking Djokovic at the top of the rankings. Djokovic, below par but dangerous to the end, saved two match points but could not hold off his one-time rabbit in the second-set tie-break and Cilic wrapped it up 6-4, 7-6 in an hour and 44 minutes. \u201cI played really smart tennis from beginning to end,\u201d the world No10 said courtside. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of tough battles the past couple of years and that helped me today. I was really hitting the spots. In the end, a few points are going to decide these matches and I was glad I stayed so cool. \u201cI\u2019m just enjoying it. I\u2019ve made it to London [for the ATP World Tour Finals] and then Davis Cup at home. I hope I can continue to play this well.\u201d Suspicions that Djokovic was out of sorts or carrying an injury after a desultory press conference on Thursday evening were given substance in a slow start, but he repaired the damage of an early break. The tournament doctor gave Djokovic a pill after the long seventh game and the Serb was coughing slightly before resuming with a new racket but not a lot of his customary verve. At the point when he might have been expected to impose his will on an opponent he had subdued so often, Djokovic dumped a regulation backhand to give Cilic the set. The utopia of the world No1 had been disturbed for the second time in two days. On Thursday, Djokovic came from behind to beat Grigor Dimitrov, but 19 unforced errors here, most of them on his forehand, were draining his early potency. Cilic grew tall in a twinkling, hitting hard and cleanly off the ground, and Djokovic had to fight to stay with him. The Croat had been mentally strong for an hour. Now he needed to trust his game, to keep playing his shots against the best defensive player of the modern era. When broken to love in the ninth game, a weary backhand finding the net, Cilic\u2019s shoulders drooped as of old; but the spring returned to his step when Djokovic double-faulted twice to bring them back to parity. Reprieved and relieved, Cilic knew he could not waste too many more chances. Djokovic\u2019s dilemma was even more pressing. Five minutes after serving for the set, he went up to the line at 5-6 with ball in hand to stay in the tournament. He chose to gamble rather than grind, hunting at the net instead of seeking the comfort of the baseline, and handed Cilic two match points with a wayward forehand. He saved the first with a backhand volley, the second with a withering forehand from mid-court for deuce, and raised his arms to the crowd in celebration. When he forced the tie-break with a deft winner into the deuce corner, he was energised again. Cilic, who had struck nine aces, went for power over caution, a double-fault restricting him to a 4-2 lead at the changeover. He had not been this close to beating Djokovic since taking him to five sets in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon two years ago, and a booming serve to Djokovic\u2019s backhand gave him another four match points, the first on his own serve. This time he did it, planting the final winner into the corner and bathing in the applause of a shocked crowd. The ballet sequence that brings the film An American in Paris to a wonderful climax lasted 17 minutes. When occasional doubles buddies John Isner and Jack Sock did their thing in the quarter-finals of the singles here on Friday, they stretched their on-court friendship to two hours and 17 minutes, the beanpole marathon man of legend prevailing to earn his semi-final against Cilic. A match between Isner, the serving beast whose 11 hours and five minutes on court against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon six years ago will forever be his defining contribution to the game, and Sock, his Nebraskan friend, who would later complete his 33rd match in as many days, had three sets written all over it. And so it came to pass \u2013 and lob and chip and volley \u2013 the denouement a tricky finish for Isner, who served it out 7-6, 4-6, 6-4 after leading 4-0 in the third. Sock, who reached four finals in four weeks for a return of 12-4 in singles and 14-1 in doubles, still had a doubles chore to complete later in the day, with another American in Paris, Nicholas Monroe. It\u2019s a hell of a way to make a living."
"12||Happy 80th birthday, TV! And now for the world's biggest vintage telly addictsFrom Wales to New Zealand, you can find telly addicts who have devoted their entire lives to hoarding the earliest ever TVs. These vintage technology freaks desperate to preserve history run television museums as passion projects. They are hidden away in barns, vans and sheds \u2013 and they are run without funding; these places are powered on nostalgia alone. As broadcast television celebrates its 80th birthday, we meet the obsessive owners of the most unique TV museums. The one that sounds like a Star Wars character This vintage TV museum on wheels used to broadcast outside Buckingham Palace. With a name that makes it sound like a Star Wars character \u2013 the 1969 CMCR9 North 3, Type 2, C9 \u2013 the North 3 was the roving control room that captured the first days of colour TV. It was abandoned for 25 years before being bought in 2008 and fully restored by Steve Harris. Today, it\u2019s the only remaining (working) BBC broadcast mobile with its original cameras. \u201cOne was probably used on the wedding of Charles and Diana and prime ministers like Harold Wilson and Margaret Thatcher,\u201d says Harris. \u201cThere is still a lot to be done on North 3; it\u2019s never-ending,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt has taken over all my spare time \u2013 but it is keeping me busy beyond retirement age.\u201d \u2022 North 3 The one with TVs the size of a fridge Mike Bennett has been hoarding televisions since he was a child. At one point, his collection got so large that it filled his home, his garage and an entire rented barn. Today, it has an unlikely location: an even larger barn in the village of Beaford, North Devon that is packed with pre-war and colour TVs, vintage video ephemera and TV history. The rarest items, says Bennett, are the Ekco experimental colour TV from the late 1950s, and the black-and-white sets from the 1940s and 1950s that are so big they\u2019re the size of refrigerators. \u201cI don\u2019t like to see old technology being scrapped, especially when there is a danger that it may one day be gone forever,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s human nature to preserve the past, but perhaps it\u2019s just me and all the other old fools who are far too sentimental.\u201d \u2022 South West England Vintage Television Museum The first one in the US Dedicated to tech from the 20s to the 50s, The Early is set in a bungalow in Hilliard, Ohio. In 2001, retired cable TV businessman Steve McVoy realised \u201cthere was no museum in the US that focused on early television \u2013 so I started one.\u201d His prized possession is a TK-41 \u2013 the first ever colour TV camera, introduced to America in 1954. And parked outside is an original van from WGSF TV, the station in Newark, Ohio that covered Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 election win. \u2022 The Early Television Foundation and Museum The one that filmed JFK Liam O\u2019Hainnin, originally from Ireland but based in the German town of Pfungstadt, has been fascinated with the world of television ever since an Irish TV crew came to his dad\u2019s farm to make a documentary in the 60s. Now, he has over 70 sets from the 1920s and 1930s, including a mechanical one with a Nipkow wheel, designed by none other than John Logie Baird. The museum is in his home, and splays across an anteroom, a guestroom and even a bathroom \u2013 a number of small TVs sit over the toilet. But perhaps his most prized item is the Kod TV camera that recorded John F Kennedy\u2019s famous \u201cIch bin ein Berliner\u201d speech in Berlin in 1963. The camera has a famously large Taylor Hobson lens \u2013 \u201cI got it from one of the cameramen that had it,\u201d says O\u2019Hainnin. He also has a 1939 prototype called a DE 7 R \u2013 the first square screen in the world of which only 50 models were built. (It was never mass-produced because of the second world war.) \u2022 Farvis Fernsehmuseum Pfungstadt The one with a TV the size of a postage stamp Brian Belanger opened the National Capital Radio and Television museum in a century-old farmhouse in Bowie, Maryland, back in 1999. Its aim is to tell the story of how television came from radio, so its collection includes a See-All scanning disc TV set from 1931, \u201cwhere you would watch a tiny picture the size of a postage stamp,\u201d says Belanger. Also on show is a Crosley Reado from 1939, which was like a fax machine that worked by radio. \u201cIn the middle of the night, radio stations would broadcast a signal to the device, and by the morning, you would have a long strip of paper with your morning newspaper,\u201d he says. \u2022 The National Capital Radio and Television Museum The one for Starship Trooper fans In the village of Waipu, New Zealand, former child actor Tylor Keith has turned a 1957 fire station into an art gallery, with a shed out back full of actor autographs and original props. His favourite items include costumes from the American TV shows Married With Children, Hannah Montana and even a Mobile Infantry pin from Starship Troopers. \u2022 The Movie and TV Museum The one that still dreams of Jeannie Former TV repairman Larry Auman has been collecting sets for half a century (he\u2019s been in the business since 1964, so finding TVs from the late 1930s and 1940s wasn\u2019t hard at first). He kept his collection in a small room above his garage until he opened his museum in Dover, Ohio in 2004. Today, Auman has 160 TV sets, plus props, adverts and 60s board games of shows like I Dream of Jeannie and The Jetsons. All he wants is for visitors to \u201clook back at the sights and sounds of years gone by.\u201d \u2022 Auman Museum of Radio &amp; Television"
"16||From lightning suits to algae-munching drones: how design is electrifying DubaiOn the edge of the sprawling emirate of Dubai, in an area that was until recently a large patch of sand, gaggles of well-dressed twentysomethings roll around in spinning chairs designed by Thomas Heatherwick, while others queue at a coffee cart, admiring the shiny lampshades in the window of a pop-up Tom Dixon showroom. Dubai Design District, a grid of six-storey glass office buildings separated by wide boulevards lined with restaurants and shops, has the generic non-place feel of Norman Foster\u2019s Spitalfields \u2013 apart from the 40C heat, which leaves its wide plazas desolate by day. On the floors above the pop-up shows laid on for Dubai design week, the newly minted satellite studios of Foster, Zaha Hadid, Santiago Calatrava and others are working away on more elaborate plans to be conjured from the sand. With Dubai\u2019s development machine tentatively back in action following the 2008 financial crisis, the big projects are back on track. There\u2019s Hadid\u2019s rippling Bee\u2019ah waste management HQ in Sharjah; Foster\u2019s Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation; and what promises to be the latest tallest tower in the world, by Calatrava. Not content with the 830-metre Burj Khalifa, Dubai is planning another, so as not to be outdone by Saudi Arabia\u2019s 1km-tall Jeddah tower, fast rising out of the ground. While the architectural willy-waving continues apace across the Gulf, the Dubai Design District (D3 for short) professes to be something different. \u201cWe have learned from our mistakes,\u201d says Mohammad Saeed Al-Shehhi, D3\u2019s chief operating officer, standing over a glowing model of the 180-hectare masterplan in his pristine white robe. As he talks, throbbing lights pick out the planned 13 luxury hotels, the swooping central events building, the 2km waterfront promenade, the hundreds of offices and apartments, their undulating rooftops rising and falling in waves according to a \u201cdraped fabric\u201d concept \u2013 all to be complete by 2021. \u201cThis will be a vibrant ecosystem for global design and creativity,\u201d he adds. \u201cNot just another business park.\u201d The project is the latest themed enclave by business park developer Tecom, a branch of the royal investment vehicle, Dubai Holding, responsible for a number of rather lifeless \u201csector-focused communities\u201d across the city. From Dubai Science Park and Outsource City to Knowledge Park and Internet City, these free zones were the foundation of Dubai\u2019s economic success, designed to lure foreign companies with a range of incentives, including relaxations on visas, customs and foreign ownership of property. According to one insider, before the 2008 crash, D3 was intended to be a new Humanitarian City for NGOs, until they realised that design was more lucrative than aid. Still, with the arrival of Foster\u2019s design school in 2018, there is hope that the district might incubate a new generation of homegrown talent. Your own portable wind turbine \u2026 the best of Dubai design week The Global Grad Show features 150 graduation projects from 50 design schools and 30 different countries. It is the grad show to end all grad shows, featuring the cream of the crop from all over the globe. By bringing the projects together in one room, interesting threads begin to emerge, the same issues being addressed with both low and high-tech solutions. There are hearing aids designed as fashion accessories, a cargo trailer for bike-sharing schemes, as well as the \u201cworld\u2019s first silk violin\u201d. One recurring preoccupation is the charging of mobile phones when you\u2019re on the move. It is variously tackled with a portable folding wind turbine by Nils Ferber from ECAL in Lausanne, a solar-powered phone by Arturo Marquez Evangelista from UNAM in Mexico City, and a photo-voltaic window socket by Kyuho Song and Boa Oh from the Samsung Art and Design Institute in Seoul \u2013 a solar charger that you can simply stick to a window with a suction pad. At the more futuristic end of the spectrum comes an algae-eating drone designed to clean polluted water, by Fredrik Ausinsch from the Ume\u00e5 Institute of Design in Sweden, and a sci-fi prosthetic that gives you superhero powers. Designed by Kourosh Atefipour from the Royal College of Art, the Raiden exoskeleton allows up to 12,000 volts of electricity to crackle from the wearer\u2019s hand, enabling you to solder metal with the pinch of your fingers. Now you too can shoot bolts of lightning from your hands like Emperor Palpatine in Star Wars, with just seven AA batteries. Some of the most compelling innovations are in the healthcare arena, with particularly strong work addressing parenting and child development. Sin Bing Wong from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, responding to her city\u2019s high-pressure lifestyle, has developed a discreet wearable breast pump for working mothers. \u201cMany women are forced to stop breastfeeding because of conditions in the workplace,\u201d says Wong. \u201cMy design aims to foster a private, comfortable and convenient experience that allows its users to pump milk without having to retreat to the unpleasant, unhygienic environment of a toilet.\u201d Students at the Eindhoven University of Technology, meanwhile, have developed a smart swaddling blanket for premature babies that simulates \u201ckangaroo care\u201d, in which the infant is held in skin-to-skin contact with a parent for as long as possible each day. Bolstering bags provide support on all sides, while the mother\u2019s heartbeat is recorded and replayed by a vibrating pad within the blanket, and her scent absorbed within the fabric for extra comfort. Growing up with an autistic younger brother, Heeju Kim was determined to find a way to allow others to empathise with how he experiences the world. Her autism empathy tools provide a window into what it\u2019s like to live with autism. She has designed a VR cardboard headset and a smartphone app that reproduces autistic visual processing, earphones that can emulate deafness and oversensitive hearing, and disposable tongue-tying sweets that make it harder to pronounce particular sounds. Together, they create a powerfully disorienting experience. But, in the context of D3, the most crucial innovation missing from the show is at the architectural scale of thinking \u2013 a response to the fact that, in the Gulf climate, repeating the same old model of fully glazed buildings set around big plazas, miles from a metro station, might not be the best way of going about creating the sustainable \u201cvibrant ecosystem\u201d they\u2019re looking for."
"6||Diver may have found 'lost nuke' missing since cold war off Canada coastThe Canadian navy will be heading to the coast of British Columbia to investigate claims that a diver may have come across \u201cthe lost nuke\u201d \u2013 a Mark IV bomb that went missing after an American B-36 bomber crashed in the region during the cold war. Diver Sean Smyrichinsky was wrapping up a day of diving near Haida Gwaii, an archipelago 80km west of the coast of British Columbia, when he stumbled across what may be the remains of the world\u2019s first known \u201cbroken arrow\u201d \u2013 the code name for accidents involving American nuclear weapons. \u201cI was just looking for fish for the next day. I figured I would do a little reconnaissance dive looking around and on my dive I got pretty far from my boat,\u201d he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cAnd then I found something that I had never, ever seen before.\u201d The object was huge, he said, measuring around 12 feet long. \u201cIt resembled a bagel cut in half, and then around the circle of the bagel these bolts all molded into it, like half spheres. It was the strangest thing I had ever seen.\u201d He came out of the water, excitedly describing the bowl-shaped object and its bolts that were bigger than basketballs. \u201cI started telling my crew: \u2018My God, I found a UFO.\u2019\u201d He sketched a rough outline of what he had seen on a napkin. Smyrichinsky started asking around, curious if anyone else had ever come across the mysterious object. \u201cNobody had ever seen it before or heard of it. Nobody ever dives there,\u201d he told the Vancouver Sun. \u201cThen some old-timer said: \u2018Oh, you might have found that bomb.\u2019\u201d It was a reference to the Mark IV, a 10-foot, blimp-shaped nuclear bomb weighing some five tonnes and which went missing over the Pacific during a US air force B-36 training flight on 13 February 1950. According to the Royal Aviation Museum of Western Canada, the intercontinental bomber had left an air base in Alaska for a mission that included a simulated drop on San Francisco when three of the plane\u2019s six engines caught fire. The crew was forced to abandon the bomber but US air force reports said they first jettisoned the bomb over the Pacific. The US military said the lost bomb was a dummy capsule \u2013 packed with lead rather than the plutonium core needed for an atomic explosion. The bomber disappeared from the radar screen just before midnight. Days later, 12 of the 17 men onboard were found alive. The plane, set to autopilot by the crew before they parachuted out of the aircraft, crashed into the snow-covered mountains of northern British Columbia. The parallels between what he had seen and the story of the lost nuke sent Smyrichinsky searching online. \u201cAnd sure enough, there was a story about this lost bomb,\u201d he told CBC. An image turned up a photo resembling what he had seen. \u201cA big circle with these balls, I had no idea that particular bomb contained all these big balls, bigger than basketballs.\u201d A further search suggested that the balls \u2013 each some 20 inches across, he said \u2013 were home to the explosive stored in the Mark IV. The bomber had crashed some 50 miles south of where he had been diving. \u201cI\u2019m right in the right area and it looks like it could be a piece of that thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else could it possibly be? I was thinking UFO, but probably not a UFO, right?\u201d Smyrichinsky detailed his find in an email to Canada\u2019s department of national defence, who told him they were looking into the matter with \u201ckeen interest\u201d. The Canadian Armed Forces said on Friday that a Canadian navy ship would be deployed in the coming weeks to investigate the object. Government records indicate that the lost bomb was a dummy and poses little risk of nuclear detonation, said a spokesperson. \u201cNonetheless we do want to be sure and we do want to investigate it further,\u201d he said. A team specialising in unexploded ordnance will determine what risk, if any, the object poses and whether it should be retrieved from its resting place or left as is, he added."
"18||Black magic surgeon: Doctor Strange brings the occult back to the big screenThis week\u2019s release of Marvel\u2019s latest, Doctor Strange, brings magic, sorcery, extra-dimensional travel and, most importantly, well-tailored robes into the comic book film universe. Those who are au fait with the paranormal tend not to be the heroes in stories like these. One need only think back to this summer\u2019s Ghostbusters reboot to recall a film in which science, reason and expensive technological breakthroughs triumph over mystical hoo-ha. But the whole point of Doctor Strange is that the titular protagonist enlightens himself through black magic. The character rose to prominence just as the American counterculture was beginning to dabble in forms of spirituality outside of the Judeo-Christian establishment. The adventures of Stephen Strange tapped into eastern mysticism, psychedelic trips into alternate realities, and the absolute certainty that there is more to existence than what you can see with your eyes. (In fact, Doctor Strange possesses a third eye \u2013 the Eye of Agamotto, an amulet he wears around his neck that gives him special abilities such as time travel.) The mystical might not be in fashion today (save for your Williamsburg or Silver Lake denizens carving out a weekend to take ayahuasca), but in the 1960s it was at the forefront of the national conversation in the US. The world of the supernatural and the darkly spiritual loomed large on the pop culture landscape around the time of Doctor Strange\u2019s creation. Acts such as the Doors, David Bowie and Jefferson Airplane were singing about all manner of mind-expanding experiences. Movies such as Rosemary\u2019s Baby, the Exorcist, the Omen, the Wicker Man and the Devils portrayed black magic, paganism and the like in direct opposition to the benign tenets of Christianity. In these movies, the devil is real and he uses his power to seduce the physical realm with impunity. One could point to the fallout from the hippie movement\u2019s fascination with psychotropics and the aftermath of the Charles Manson killings as the impetus for the interest in such things, but Rosemary\u2019s Baby (directed by Roman Polanski, whose pregnant wife Sharon Tate was a Manson victim) came out before Manson, Altamont and the end of the so-called Summer of Love. Unlike those films, which were targeted at adults, Doctor Strange was (and is) for children. Selling a story about black magic to kids was no easy feat, especially one that existed in an approximation of the real world rather than a made-up realm where the \u201cnatural rules\u201d, as they\u2019re referred to in the Strange film, don\u2019t apply. In 1974, Steve Englehart, Neal Adams and Frank Brunner created the character Sise-neg (Genesis spelled backwards) in the pages of the Marvel Premiere series starring Doctor Strange. Sise-neg was a sorcerer rival of Strange who used time travel to destroy the universe, then recreate it in his image. In the end, he merely recreates the universe as it was, broaching the question of whether or not this being was actually God itself. The religious implications were so controversial that Marvel editor Stan Lee considered retracting the entire story until Englehart and Brunner published a fake letter from a fictional minister praising the work. It\u2019s Doctor Strange\u2019s connection to our conception of reality that opens him up to such criticism. Setting a fantasy story in a far-off land, alternative universe or parallel reality affords the writer a freedom from allegations of apostasy or heretical thinking. The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Golden Compass and countless other stories that might seem blasphemous to the true believer get off the hook because they don\u2019t exist in our conception of reality. Often, these works dabble within a world that resembles the distant past, which further removes it from those thorny questions of divinity. Star Wars pulled off that sleight of hand while still getting to play around with sci-fi iconography by explaining in the first frame of the movie that it was a story from \u201ca long time ago, in a galaxy far far away\u201d. George Lucas could invent an entire religion that governs the fate of the universe while never once having to connect that to people\u2019s actual belief systems. Star Trek (and also Asimov\u2019s seminal Foundation trilogy), on the other hand, is a covertly atheist story about humanity overcoming conflict through science and reason. By the 80s, the Indiana Jones series posited that pretty much every religious or occult myth was real \u2013 the Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail, Hinduism, etc. Does it matter that Jesus, Kali Ma and aliens from another dimension all exist? I guess not. Perhaps they\u2019re all pals in some far-off land. In the 90s, The Blair Witch Project, The Craft, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the hugely popular X-Files series all carried the banner of the occult in culture. The X-Files made a lot out of the debate over faith v science and religion v the paranormal, often cracking the audience over the head with a giant wooden cross of thudding symbolism. In 2016, Charlie Brooker\u2019s Black Mirror generates scares by showing that our greatest inventions will be our undoing, or more accurately, that our hubris and desire to overcome our physical limitations are ultimately destructive \u2013 a notion film-makers such as David Cronenberg were playing with parallel to the last occult boom in pop culture in the body horror works of Videodrome and Scanners. The occult retains a modicum of its power to terrify in the age of the iPhone, though. Even though the Blair Witch sequel/reboot failed to relaunch that franchise, 2015\u2019s The Witch was very much in the tradition of the classic occult horror films while also succeeding at the specialty box office. The Doctor Strange film digs up these old-timey notions of spirituality and inverts them. Here, the occult can set you free. It can be used to save humanity. More importantly, it exists in a world very much like our own. Sure, Doctor Strange hangs out in the Sanctum Sanctorum and his battles with Dormammu or Baron Mordo usually take place in some other realm, but that Sanctum sits on Bleecker Street in a fictional version of the real Manhattan. He\u2019s just a regular guy who learned to manipulate the spiritual realm through years of study, not a wizard designated as such by genetics. Notions like fate and familial superiority, which are prevalent in Star Wars and Harry Potter, are forsaken in favor of the more traditionally puritanical American ideal of hard work. His sidekick, Wong, might tell him he\u2019s born to study the mystical arts, but that\u2019s not because his dad was a sorcerer. There may not be the hi-tech gadgets of something like Ghostbusters, but Doctor Strange shares with those futuristic paranormal fantasies the idea that no matter what the discipline, knowledge is power."
"17||Oil price falls as Saudi Arabia and Iran argue over outputSquabbling between Saudi Arabia and Iran has sent the oil price down, as tension between the near neighbours threatened to derail talks aimed at cutting production by the Opec group of oil-producing countries. Riyadh is reportedly threatening to turn the screw on Tehran before this month\u2019s crunch Opec meeting by increasing its own output to push prices even lower. Saudi Arabia produces up to 10.7m barrels per day (bpd), but Opec sources said it had threatened to open the taps much further. \u201cThe Saudis have threatened to raise their production to 11m bpd and even 12m bpd, bringing oil prices down, and to withdraw from the meeting,\u201d one Opec source told Reuters. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude dropped to $45.02 before recovering to $45.42, down 2%, after Opec\u2019s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, denied Saudi Arabia had made any threats. Reports of a row come with Opec countries due to meet on 30 November to discuss curbing supply to boost prices, as they wrestle with a global oil glut. They met at Opec\u2019s Vienna headquarters last month to finalise the terms of an output cut from 34m bpd to as low as 32.5m bpd, but failed to agree quotas for each country. \u201cThere\u2019s a gang of four or five who don\u2019t want any cuts at all, for all sorts of reasons. They [Saudi Arabia] are trying to whip the others into line and I think Iran will come into line,\u201d said Malcolm Graham-Wood of advisory firm Hydrocarbon Capital. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of how they decide to word it so that everyone comes out looking politically sensible. There\u2019s a lot of saving of face within Opec so that people don\u2019t look stupid.\u201d Saudi Arabia, which has previously flooded the markets with cheap crude in a failed attempt to kill off the US shale gas boom, can afford to play chicken with Iran over prices. This is because Iran\u2019s cost of production is higher, meaning it earns less per barrel, and it is still ramping up output after economic sanctions against it were lifted this year. But Graham-Wood said Riyadh might simply be flexing its muscles as a negotiating tactic, pointing out that plans to list state oil company Saudi Aramco on the stock market next year mean it has more reason to protect oil prices. \u201cThe last thing the Saudis want if they\u2019re going to float Saudi Aramco is to have a bad oil market next year. So to save face, I think they won\u2019t say publicly they\u2019ll cut production but if they need the oil price up, they\u2019ll agree with the Iranians that they both take some production off,\u201d he said. Al Stanton, oil analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the uncertainty around Opec has left oil explorers and producers sitting on their hands. \u201cThe oil companies are likely to hold fire with their budgets until they\u2019ve seen what happens,\u201d he said."
"1||England's most deprived area talks of betrayal after Brexit rulingMaurice Wojtowycz, whose father was Ukrainian, has been selling baked potatoes in Oldham town centre for the past 20 years. Most of his custom comes from young Asian men and women in headscarves. He voted for Brexit due to fears about mass immigration. As he understood it, he had done his duty, had his say, his vote had counted and Britain would leave the European Union. But Thursday\u2019s high court ruling indicated that politicians could have the final say and held the power to trigger the departure. It has left some in Oldham feeling betrayed. The north-west town was named by the Office for National Statistics this year as the most deprived area in England. The skyline is still dominated by the cotton mills that were once the powerhouses of the north. In the 1960s there were more than 300 working mills, but the town has been in a steady decline ever since. Now many of those mills sit derelict and in disrepair, a stark reminder of Oldham\u2019s lost industry and of why more than 60% of the borough voted to leave. Wojtowycz says the judges\u2019 ruling will only increase anti-Westminster feeling in the town. \u201cIt\u2019s always the people with a lot of money sat in London who think they know best for us. For once I honestly thought that we were being listened to and the will of the British public would prevail \u2013 but obviously not. \u201cBy doing this, what they are saying is that our concerns about the EU are not valid. What we think doesn\u2019t count. There are genuine problems here with mass immigration and a feeling that we have always been stifled by the EU in our courts \u2013 but when we say this we are branded racist. And we are told others know better than us. This is meant to be a democracy. It surely doesn\u2019t feel like it right now.\u201d Patricia Binns, 64, does not share Wojtowycz\u2019s political sentiment as she voted to remain, but does agree that politicians should bow to the will of the people. \u201cEven though I wanted to stay in the EU and could appreciate the benefits of everything the EU has to offer, I don\u2019t agree with the ruling,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the people that decided and it is not for the politicians to try and reverse this decision. You have to respect the way the people voted. \u201cAnd then of course there is all this money they are going to waste trying to stop it. We just need to get a plan in place now that the vote has taken place rather than scramble around trying to delay it.\u201d But others in Oldham are relieved by the decision, which is likely to slow the pace of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. Eddie Wolinski, 66, who is of Polish descent, says: \u201cI am in favour of the judgment. With Brexit, people wanted power back within our courts and this is an example of that. \u201cI would like the decision to leave to be reversed. Since the vote it has been a very worrying time. Foreigners have been blamed for everything and it just doesn\u2019t make sense. People were blaming foreigners for problems in their own lives. I would like to see an educated decision being made about the EU.\u201d Stallholder Mohammed Asad, 48, a Pakistani immigrant who lived in Belgium for 20 years before moving to the UK, says he has been subjected to racist attacks since the referendum. \u201cFor me this [ruling] is a good thing. My life changed after the vote and all of a sudden I became someone to target. We are not here to steal jobs or create any problems. We would like to live side by side with everyone else,\u201d he says. \u201cThe judges have made this decision and it is the right one. The problem here is not foreigners, and the problem with the EU is not immigration. We hope that maybe now things may go back to how they were or change for the better.\u201d"
"10||Eric Simpson obituaryMy friend Eric Simpson, who has died aged 71, left an indelible and unusual legacy through his involvement with the Hospital Broadcasting Service (HBS), the voluntary organisation airing programmes to hospitals across the Glasgow area. While hospital radio was seen as a lark for some and a stepping stone to being a professional DJ for others, Eric\u2019s mission was to ensure that the listener received the best HBS could offer, and he had a good ear for new talent. The BBC presenter and announcer Charles Nove began his career at HBS. He recalled: \u201cEric took the view that, voluntary organisation or not, the highest professional standards were the aiming point. His critiques and pointers were often \u2018direct\u2019, but they were also right.\u201d The BBC Radio 2 presenter Ken Bruce, who also began at HBS, said: \u201cI would have had no career without the help and guidance of Eric; he was my biggest single influence and I owe him much.\u201d Eric could be persuasive. I recall the day he drove round and round my home, refusing to let me out of his car until I promised to make a demo tape for Radio Clyde. I was already making short features for the BBC, but Eric decided that more radical action would be better for me. He was correct: it led to my first work as a professional presenter. Eric was born in Glasgow, son of Alice and Norman, and spent his formative years in Perthshire, where his father was a publican. It was an era when radio had yet to be eclipsed by TV in mass popularity, and Eric was captivated by the magic of the medium. Although he had a long career as a librarian and teacher, from 1974 until 2005 at Anniesland Further Education College, where he rose to be head of Metro (multimedia education training and resource opportunities) and learning resources, his greater contribution was to hospital radio. Eric resigned as chairman of HBS in 2003, but his resolve to withdraw from broadcasting did not last long. Soon he was wooed back to lend his ear and insight to the training of new presenters. In his later years he spent winters in New Zealand, sparked initially by the presence there of his sister, Norma, who survives him, and where he had built a firm network of friends; but when he was in Scotland, HBS matters were never far away from his thoughts, even while he was being treated for the non-Hodgkin lymphoma that proved terminal. Few people prepare the order of service for their own funeral. Eric did: surely a way of ensuring his high standards were maintained."
"6||Rebel assault on west Aleppo continues as Russian deadline nearsRebel militants were continuing their attacks on loyalist west Aleppo on Friday, hours before a Russian ultimatum to abandon the Syrian city was due to take effect. The two-day push has involved the use of car bombs, reportedly driven by suicide attackers, as well as mortars fired into residential areas, and is believed to have killed at least 10 people. As the Russian deadline drew near, the assault appeared to remain far from its goals of opening a supply line to the rebel-held east, which would allow in food, weapons and medicines, as well as securing a safe passage for those wishing to flee. The push is being led by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, a jihadi group that shares much of al-Qaida\u2019s worldview and to which rebels in the city have increasingly turned for help to break a crippling siege. Opposition groups in Aleppo acknowledge the prevalence of jihadi groups in the current battle but insist they hold sway inside the city limits. The presence of jihadis in the opposition ranks has been highly contentious throughout the war for northern Syria, but has increasingly taken centre stage as diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire have intensified. Russia had made separating jihadis from other opposition groups a condition of earlier failed truce efforts, a goal that the US had also backed. However, with the latest truce due to expire at sunset on Friday, those and other attempts to bring a ceasefire to Aleppo appear to have collapsed, and the city faces its biggest threat yet. \u201cThe rebels don\u2019t really seem to care about what is coming,\u201d said a senior diplomat. \u201cSeparating them all is too hard for now, because they don\u2019t want to be seen to surrender. And they think that the Russians have been bombing them for so long that whatever comes next won\u2019t be any different. For them, it is all about west Aleppo.\u201d While the regime-held west of Syria\u2019s second city remains largely unscathed by the war, in contrast to the ravaged east, opposition attacks have killed scores of people and led to some evacuations. Syrian officials said rocket fire into west Aleppo was indiscriminate and lethal. Vladimir Putin has sent a Russian carrier group to the eastern Mediterranean, where it is expected to take part in a blitz on east Aleppo as early as this weekend, in the three days before the US election. There were reports on Friday that Moscow\u2019s only aircraft carrier had broken down during the week long journey to the Syrian coast, but it is believed to be close enough to take part in any action, along with other Russian warships and submarines. Thousands of pro-Assad forces, led by Iranian-backed militias, are travelling to west Aleppo in an attempt to cut off the attack, which is being led by around 400 militants. On Friday Russia launched air strikes in support of loyalist forces in the area."

"3||Australia\u2019s mental edge proves Wales\u2019s biggest barrier to ending losing streakAustralia\u2019s matches against Wales have come to be a victory of mind over matter. No matter how much time the Wallabies spend on the back foot, trying to disengage from a scrum or checking their body parts after a rampaging run by Jamie Roberts or George North, they keep their heads so that when a game nears its end, with lungs bursting and legs aching, they have the wherewithal to fashion the decisive play. The Wallabies have snatched victory at the last over Wales too often for it to be a coincidence. Since they last lost to the men in red eight years ago, they have won all 11 matches against them and all but the first have been by a single-figure margin. The former Australia coach Robbie Deans, talking this week about the supremacy of New Zealand, said the All Blacks had mastered the mental side of the game and that \u201cwhen things go against them, they respond the best\u201d. After Wales had lost to Australia in Cardiff two years ago having led 10 minutes from the end, their former flanker Martyn Williams praised the high tempo of the home side but lamented they did not appreciate when they needed to slow down and \u201cread the game situation\u201d. It perhaps explains that while Wales have been talking about the need to break into the top four of the world rankings before May\u2019s World Cup draw to maximize their chances of escaping another difficult pool, the Wallabies said it was not something they had thought about, concerned only about ending a poor year on a higher note. Australia are not where they were two years ago when they looked a shambles and Michael Cheika became their third coach in little more than a year, but neither are they the side of 2015 when they won the Rugby Championship and reached the World Cup final. They have lost a core of experience since then, especially behind the scrum where Tevita Kuridrani and Reece Hodge team up in the midfield for the first time and face Test rugby\u2019s most experienced centre partnership, Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies. Wales are without three Lions forwards in Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Taulupe Faletau, but the only players in their starting lineup who missed the World Cup are Davies, Leigh Halfpenny and Rhys Webb, who were all injured. They may have an interim coach in Rob Howley but their squad are settled and Australia know what to expect. Cheika has kept Israel Folau at full-back rather than moving him to outside-centre to get the ball to him earlier, preferring to keep one of the game\u2019s most proficient players under the high kicks as the last line of defence against a side who place considerable emphasis on the aerial battle. In the back row he is playing two openside flankers, as he did in the World Cup and earlier this year. David Pocock was then deployed at No8 but against Wales he will be at blindside flanker with Michael Hooper on the openside. It reduces Australia\u2019s lineout options, not that Wales kick the ball out of play as a tactic, but keeps the 19st Lopeti Timani at No8 as a physical counterweight. Part of Cheika\u2019s reasoning is that it makes his side more effective at the breakdown, an area of weakness in their 3-0 series defeats by England and New Zealand. \u201cWe are a new team that is getting to know each other and an area where you struggle at that stage of your development is in transition when the ball is turned over,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cWe have been working hard defensively and we have to improve there. When a turnover happens, and it will, we have to be clinical in the way we shut it down.\u201d Wales have been working on the handling skills of their tight-five forwards, mindful that one reason for New Zealand\u2019s pre-eminence is the athleticism, dexterity and awareness of their front and second rows. As they look to evolve into a side who tax opponents mentally and physically, they have become more porous defensively, conceding 21 tries in their past four Tests. Australia showed in defeat to New Zealand last month that their attack can stress the best defences. \u201cWe see Wales as a huge opponent and the scores in recent games against them tell that story,\u201d Cheika said, \u201cclose and entertaining. I have a feeling it is going to be close again.\u201d Another case of mind and the old grey matter."
"10||Vaping does not help people stop smoking, says WHO reportCountries should consider curbing the use of e-cigarettes because there is not enough evidence to show they help people stop smoking, according to a World Health Organisation report. Vaping will be on the agenda of a major meeting starting in India on Monday of the 180 countries that have signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, aimed at combatting Big Tobacco and preventing the millions of deaths every year around the world caused by smoking. But the public health community is split over whether e-cigarettes are friend or foe and some are outraged by the WHO\u2019s advice to the meeting. It suggests countries that have not already banned e-cigarettes and other forms of nicotine delivery might want to consider imposing severe restrictions, including banning the flavouring of e-cigarettes as well as sales, advertising and possession by young people. Countries might also want to ban nicotine delivery devices from all public places where smoking is not allowed, require health warnings about the chemicals in them, include information on the addictive potential of nicotine and ban any claims that they can help people give up tobacco smoking, the report says. The WHO suggests these are reasonable measures to control the use of products with effects that are still unknown \u2013 and which are increasingly being manufactured by the multinational tobacco corporations the signatories to the convention are pledged to defeat. But for some in the public health community, WHO\u2019s report is a backward step that will hamper the fight to cut tobacco-related deaths. Professor John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies based at Nottingham University, said the WHO report was unbalanced. \u201cThere is nothing saying e-cigarettes are allowing hundreds of thousands of people to stop smoking,\u201d he said. The convention exists to combat tobacco use, not nicotine use, he said. \u201cIt is perfectly reasonable to be concerned that young people might use e-cigarettes and become addicted. All those arguments apply to licensed nicotine products that anybody can walk into Tesco and buy.\u201d But nicotine regulation is for other agencies, he said. Britton is concerned about the \u201cflavour\u201d of the WHO document \u201cwhich is that these products are out there, they are being produced by tobacco companies and we should probably ban them \u2013 or if not, here are some regulations that you might want to introduce.\u201d The meeting in Delhi will be a conference of the parties (COP) that have signed the treaty, which includes national governments and the European Union. It takes place every two years to decide the future direction of tobacco control. The WHO report was written at the request of the parties who wanted to know about the scientific evidence for or against nicotine-delivery devices, said Dr Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the convention secretariat. \u201cSo far there is a clear understanding that e-cigarettes should be regulated,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should not be promoted among young people and pregnant women and other specific groups. They should not be promoted widely \u2013 there should be restrictions and regulations.\u201d More monitoring of the effects and possible health benefits is needed, she said. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t think COP will close the door [to e-cigarettes], I don\u2019t think COP will open the door to them at this time,\u201d she said. The issue splits the public health community. Critics of e-cigarettes are concerned that they may be a \u201cstalking horse\u201d for Big Tobacco, which the Framework Convention has made a pariah. Countries that have signed the treaty agree under Article 5.3 that the tobacco industry is beyond the pale and must never be allowed into negotiations. If e-cigarettes can help people stop smoking, the tobacco companies can argue for their rehabilitation and a presence at the table. \u201cWhile e-cigarettes offer a significant opportunity to public health, there are also risks. One is the way the tobacco industry uses harm reduction to secure reputational and access possibilities and to split the public health camp,\u201d said Anna Gilmore, professor of public health at the University of Bath and the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies. \u201cThe tobacco industry uses e-cigarettes to claim it is committed to harm reduction, but meanwhile it continues to engage in harm maximisation by spending millions to promote tobacco and oppose any policy that would reduce its use.\u201d Ahead of the Delhi meeting, rightwing thinktanks and libertarian groups have been on the attack, arguing that the COP is secretive and not transparent, because members of the public may be excluded from the proceedings. But, says Gilmore, that is because the industry and its representatives have to be kept out of the COP discussion, under Article 5.3, \u201cyet we know the industry infiltrates these meetings often using third parties as a disguise,\u201d said Gilmore. It is impossible to screen every individual and group who wants to attend. \u201cThey are caught between a rock and a hard place, because of the industry\u2019s underhand tactics,\u201d she said."
"7||The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 quince recipesIt\u2019s quince time of year, which makes me want to skip with delight. Buy them from a good grocer or Middle Eastern shop, or, if you\u2019re very lucky, pluck them straight off a tree. Then, when you have time, set aside half a day over the weekend to make quince paste, a jam-like form of membrillo (the recipe I use is based on an old Jane Grigson one): it keeps for at least a year, and it\u2019s delicious with cheese, roast lamb, stuffed inside poultry and game, or for lending a sweet note to Persian-inspired dishes. Raw, this fruit seems tough and uncompromising, but once poached or roasted, the hard flesh softens and sweetens, goes a blushing deep pink and gives off a bewitching, floral scent. You can also use quinces in more everyday recipes, much as you would apples or pears. Roast chicken thighs with roast quince, barley and chickpea salad The fruit caramelises while roasting, which adds sweetness and contrast to this nutty, chewy salad with its crispy, sticky chicken bits. Serves six. 8 free-range chicken thighs Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 90ml extra-virgin olive oil Zest of 1 lemon 1 large bunch fresh oregano (or thyme), leaves picked 8 large garlic cloves, unpeeled 2 medium quince (about 400g), peeled, quartered and cored 200g pearl barley, rinsed in cold water 400g tinned chickpeas (I use the Napolina brand) 1 handful fresh chives, finely chopped \u00bd clove garlic, peeled and crushed 20ml white-wine vinegar 30ml buttermilk (or natural yoghurt) 1 tbsp sumac 100g rocket, washed and dried Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Put the chicken thighs in a roasting tin into which they fit relatively snugly, rub with generous amounts of salt and pepper and a tablespoon of olive oil. Grate over the lemon zest, scatter with half the oregano and tuck the garlic cloves here and there. Cut the quince quarters in half, to make slender wedges, and put these in a separate roasting tin. Season generously, then toss with two tablespoons of oil, a few tablespoons of water and the rest of the oregano. Roast the chicken and quince in the same oven for 45 minutes, until the chicken skin is crisp and the quince is caramelised and tender (quince cooking times vary: if they need longer, pop them back in and let the chicken rest in a warm spot). Meanwhile, cook the pearl barley in lots of salted, boiling water for 30-35 minutes, until tender, adding the drained and rinsed chickpeas for the last five minutes. Drain the barley and chickpeas, tip back into the pan, season and toss with the remaining oil, and the chives, crushed garlic, vinegar, buttermilk and sumac; the barley, especially, will absorb the flavours as it cools. To serve, toss the rocket through the warm salad and put on a large platter. Top with the pieces of chicken and quince, drizzle over the cooking juices and take to the table. Hazelnut and brown sugar meringue with poached quince If you poach the quince a day ahead and leave them in their liquid overnight, the colour will deepen to a deep, fleshy pink. Serves eight to 10. For the meringue 100g blanched hazelnuts 4 medium egg whites 250g demerara sugar For the quince 1 unwaxed lemon, washed 75g honey 100g demerara sugar 1 star anise 3 bay leaves 2 quince, peeled, quartered and cored 50ml brandy (optional) 450ml double cream Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Spread the hazelnuts on an oven tray and toast for eight to 10 minutes until golden brown. Leave to cool, then roughly chop. Turn down the oven to 130C/260F/gas mark \u00bd. Line a large baking tray with greased greaseproof paper. Put the egg whites in a large, spotlessly clean bowl and whisk to stiff peaks. Gradually beat in the sugar a tablespoon at a time, until thick and glossy, then gently fold in all the hazelnuts bar a small handful. Spread out the meringue in a large circle on the greased paper and bake for 75 minutes, until the surface is just firm, then turn off the oven and leave in the oven to cool. Meanwhile, peel the lemon (take care not to cut off any white pith with the zest). Put 750ml water in a large, deep pan, add the honey, sugar, spices, lemon peel and the juice of half the lemon, and bring to a boil. Cut the quince quarters in half lengthways and add to the pan. Turn down the heat to a simmer and cover the quince with a circle of greaseproof paper with a small hole poked into its centre (to let steam escape), that fits snugly inside the pot. Cover the pan with a lid and leave to simmer for 45 minutes to an hour, until the fruit is tender, then transfer to a bowl. Pour the brandy, if using, into the liquid in the pan, turn the heat right up and leave to bubble fairly briskly until reduced to a lovely, sticky syrup. Taste, add a little lemon juice if the flavours need brightening, then pour over the quince and leave to cool. To serve, softly whip the cream until it just holds its shape, then spoon over the meringue. Arrange the quince pieces on top, drizzle with syrup, sprinkle the reserved hazelnuts on top and serve. (Alternatively, smash up the meringue, mix with all the other ingredients and serve in bowls for an autumnal take on Eton mess.) And for the rest of the week\u2026 Use any excess buttermilk to make a wholemeal Irish soda bread, the fastest bread recipe I know, and one of the tastiest. You could also dice the quince before roasting, then toss it with toasted pumpkin seeds for a lovely vegetarian salad, or fry slices of quince in butter and sugar, and add to a tagine. Poached quince (or apples or pears) is also gorgeous with yoghurt, or with custard made with the egg yolks left over from the meringues."
"5||George Washington Bridge traffic trial: 10 things we learned from BridgegateFor four days in September 2013, a \u201ctraffic study\u201d closed lanes and caused rush-hour chaos for thousands of commuters trying to navigate the George Washington Bridge, the busiest road crossing in the US. The gridlock paralysed the New Jersey town of Fort Lee, which sits just across the Hudson from upper Manhattan. The Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, had declined to support the state\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Christie, in his bid for re-election. Three months later, leaked emails appeared to reveal that three senior aides to the governor had plotted to create the traffic chaos as a way to punish Sokolich. Over the past two months in federal court in Newark, the government\u2019s case against two former Christie aides, chief of staff Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni, a Christie appointee to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, has painted a fascinating picture of life inside the governor\u2019s administration. On Friday, Kelly and Baroni were found guilty on all charges, the most serious of which carry up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing was scheduled for 21 February. While Christie was never formally identified by prosecutors, the larger-than-life governor cast a long shadow over proceedings which put his claims to have known nothing about the scheme under scrutiny. Here are 10 things we learned from the trial. 1 Political payback is always apt to backfire New Jersey politics may be brutal and strange, but even here political payback schemes are apt to backfire. The fallout from Bridgegate derailed both Christie\u2019s presidential ambitions and his chances of joining the Trump ticket. With one year left in office, and term limits preventing him from running for re-election, it\u2019s not clear what he will do next. 2 It can also be costly With the jury verdict in, Bill Baroni, a suave former state senator who was tapped by Christie to be deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and co-defendant Kelly, the governor\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, could now face up to 20 years in a federal prison. 3 Wally Edge was on to something David Wildstein, the government\u2019s key witness and the acknowledged architect of the scheme, once wrote a column for a political website about silly, often-petty actions by New Jersey politicians under the pseudonym \u201cWally Edge\u201d. The column now appears to have offered accurate insight into the motivations of the Christie administration. 4 Don\u2019t email, don\u2019t text \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\u201d Kelly wrote to Wildstein a month before the plan was carried out. \u201cGot it,\u201d Wildstein responded. In court, Kelly claimed \u201ctraffic problems\u201d meant \u201ctraffic study\u201d. The jury didn\u2019t buy it. 5 Christie\u2019s allies were intensely loyal US attorney Les Cortes said Kelly\u2019s description of \u201ctraffic problems\u201d meant precisely that. \u201cThey were not about a traffic study,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are a direct view into [the] minds of the participants.\u201d Cortes argued that Baroni and Kelly shared \u201can intense commitment\u201d to the political success of Christie, and \u201cfelt they could use their political positions to execute a malicious scheme to punish a local mayor\u201d. He added: \u201cIt was a cruel and callous scheme.\u201d 6 Christie was a slick political seducer An email by Wildstein produced in court said the Christie administration considered the $8bn-a-year Port Authority a \u201cgoody bag\u201d to distribute favors, money and jobs. Wildstein testified that he was hired be the \u201cbad cop\u201d to push Christie\u2019s agenda. \u201cIf it was good for Christie, then it was good for us,\u201d he said. In court, Mayor Sokolich described the political seduction mounted by Christie and his aides. He was invited to New York Giants games in the governor\u2019s private box at MetLife Stadium, to lunch at the governor\u2019s mansion, on trips to Ground Zero in Manhattan, to holiday parties. Sokolich also described being offered \u201cVIP\u201d seats for Christie\u2019s budget address. 7 TV apologies need to be convincing As news of an alleged plot and coverup surfaced in early 2014, Christie offered a meandering, 107-minute televised apology, in which he denied any knowledge of the events and pronounced himself \u201cstunned by the abject stupidity\u201d of his aides. 8 The Donald didn\u2019t buy it, and neither do voters Even Donald Trump, who named Christie head of his transition team in the event of a presidential election win, thinks the governor knew what was going on. \u201cHe knew about it,\u201d the billionaire said at a campaign rally in South Carolina in December 2015. \u201cHe totally knew about it.\u201d According to a new survey from Fairleigh Dickinson University\u2019s PublicMind, meanwhile, just 21% of registered voters in New Jersey approve of Christie\u2019s performance as governor. What\u2019s more, 52% believe there is ample evidence Christie knew about the lane closures. 9 Sopranos references are \u2018a local Jersey thing\u2019 As one Fort Lee resident told the Guardian in 2014: \u201cSure there\u2019s a connection. It\u2019s a local Jersey thing. They\u2019re big guys who talk a lot about respect. You could say the fictional Tony Soprano paved the way for Governor Christie.\u201d Another said: \u201cI would have more respect for him if he had said, \u2018OK. I knew about it. It was a vendetta\u2019. But now he just looks like a liar who doesn\u2019t even have control of his own people.\u2019\u201d 10 This is not the end Despite the convictions of Baroni and Kelly, the legal drama is unlikely to end here. Judge Susan Wigenton instructed jurors that they could find the two defendants guilty of conspiracy without determining if the pair intentionally wanted to punish Sokolich, an instruction that effectively gutted the defendants\u2019 case, lawyers for Baroni and Kelly claimed before the verdict. They also vowed to appeal."
"3||Harry Bentley ready for the ride of his life on Limato in Breeders\u2019 CupIn the land of opportunity, Harry Bentley will be at the head of the queue on Saturday night. He has one ride at the Breeders\u2019 Cup, one chance to make a name for himself on one of racing\u2019s most exclusive stages, and the 24-year-old jockey is ready to seize it with both hands. When it comes to jockeys, the Breeders\u2019 Cup is more often a meeting where reputations are enhanced, not made. The same dozen names, the best of the best on both sides of the Atlantic, take each other on in one race after another. Bentley, though, will be an interloper when he climbs aboard Limato, the joint-favourite for the Mile, for what will be not just his first Breeders\u2019 Cup ride, but his first start at Santa Anita. As with so many of the best opportunities, chance played a part in Bentley\u2019s 5,000-mile trip to California for what could be the biggest two minutes of his life. He had never ridden Limato in a race when he bumped into Paul Jacobs, the gelding\u2019s owner, at Charles de Gaulle airport last October after Limato\u2019s second-place finish in the Prix de la For\u00eat at Longchamp. Limato had been ridden by four different jockeys on his last four starts, and Jacobs wanted a jockey to commit to his horse. The conversation that followed made up his mind. \u201cI\u2019d met Paul before then and I\u2019d ridden out for Mr [Henry] Candy [Limato\u2019s trainer],\u201d Bentley says, \u201cbut we got talking at the airport after the For\u00eat and two weeks later we spoke again and he asked if I could ride him this year. \u201cSo it was a matter of being in the right place at the right time but everyone needs a bit of luck. Obviously, Paul liked the way that I rode and everything that goes with it, so it\u2019s not just chance that I\u2019ve got this. \u201cAs far as American racing is concerned, I\u2019ve no experience and it\u2019s very good of him to keep me on, but everyone needs an opportunity and you need to be put in these positions. That\u2019s how you get the ball rolling.\u201d As Bentley talks, it is easy to see why Jacobs was impressed. He is composed, thoughtful and lucid, and can draw on two decades of experience in the saddle as he faces up to the unfamiliar challenge of Santa Anita\u2019s tight turf mile. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember a time when I wasn\u2019t riding,\u201d Bentley says. \u201cIt was more the National Hunt side of things that was in the family, point-to-pointing, and hunting and ponies, so racing was always in my blood, but not necessarily Flat racing. \u201cWe always had ponies and I was always putting my irons up a bit shorter. Racing was always what I wanted to do from when I was very young.\u201d Bentley served his apprenticeship with Gary Moore, whose stable is just a few miles from his family home in the downland village of Storrington in west Sussex. Moore\u2019s son, Ryan, will ride Alice Springs, one of Limato\u2019s main rivals on Saturday, while Tepin, the best turf miler in the United States and the winner of the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, is another daunting opponent. Limato brings outstanding form to the race too, however, including Group One wins in both the July Cup and Prix de la For\u00eat this season, and his jockey is confident he will produce his best on Saturday. \u201cI know the horse well, I\u2019ve done my homework and I feel I\u2019m well prepared, so I\u2019m pretty comfortable,\u201d Bentley says. \u201cIt could seem mad to come over for one ride but this is the pinnacle and what you work towards, so I\u2019d travel anywhere for a big ride like this and so would anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a big occasion and I\u2019m going in with a big chance but I\u2019ve been in this position before, I know how to handle myself and deal with the occasion. Obviously you get excited and look forward to it, but I feel like I handle it pretty well. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to beat Tepin on home soil, and that\u2019s hard as everything is suited to this climate and this way of racing [in America]. \u201cSo it\u2019s a tough challenge but she\u2019s had a long season and she\u2019s travelled a lot, so I think she\u2019s beatable. \u201cAs far as any sport is concerned, there always needs to be new people and new faces coming through, and you need opportunities like anyone. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to be given a fantastic opportunity, and I plan to make every possible use of it.\u201d"

"8||A few months ago, I woke up to Brexit. Here's my advice to US votersIn Britain we are still assuming that we will not wake up on Wednesday to the news that President-Elect Trump is shortly to be installed in the White House. Or the Trump House as he will call it once it\u2019s been redesigned as a building more appropriate to the 21st century. But of course we said the same about the Brexit referendum in June. There was no way Remain could lose: too much uncertainty; too much financial pain; too much of a step back into a nationalistic world of competing polities. And we were wrong. A majority \u2013 admittedly a slim majority \u2013 let out a howl of anger about a variety of issues and decided to make the EU the whipping boy for their anguish. To hell with economic growth and political stability, we were going to leave. Lots of people in the UK decided they had nothing to lose anyway, so backed the destructive course for the sheer hell of it, and maybe Americans will do the same. There comes a point where you\u2019ve gone so low in life that Armageddon looks quite attractive. When we Remainers (or \u201cBremoaners\u201d as the \u201cBrexiteers\u201d now like to paint us) woke up on 24 June to the news that the unthinkable had happened and the UK \u2013 or parts of it \u2013 had voted to leave the EU, the first reaction was one of disbelief. How could a majority of my fellow citizens have voted to turn the clock back in this way? A young woman on the news summed it up perfectly on that morning. She said she was in a daze, doing the things she normally did, seeing the people she normally saw, but knowing that many of them had voted Leave \u2013 something she saw as anathema. She likened them to \u201czombies\u201d: she thought she knew and understood the people she lived among, but clearly she didn\u2019t. This was the disbelief phase, and it quickly gave way to anger. How could voters be so dumb? How could they swallow all the Leave lies about giving more money to the NHS? People were never really told what leaving the EU would mean. The fine detail \u2013 the question of \u201chard\u201d v \u201csoft\u201d Brexit, questions about the status of EU citizens already here and British citizens living in the EU, the role of parliament in determining the terms on which we leave \u2013 are only now being discussed. The debate, if it can be called that, in the months leading up to the vote on 23 June was laughably simplistic. An immensely complex decision had been reduced to a binary vote. The referendum was a fiasco and should never have been called. Losing his job as prime minister wasn\u2019t sufficient punishment for David Cameron, who had called the referendum to try to salve wounds in the Conservative party and then led a ham-fisted, directionless campaign to keep us in. He should have been locked up in the Tower of London. But anger only gets you so far. Thinking back to the referendum, one image stuck in my mind. The day before the vote I\u2019d been shopping in a high street close to where I live in south-west London. I\u2019d noticed a young man with a clipboard \u2013 I assumed he was a student at the local university \u2013 walking up and down the street handing out leaflets and badges, and talking to passersby. He was campaigning for Remain. One person trying to do something for the cause he believed in. And I felt guilty, because I had done nothing to try to keep Britain in the EU \u2013 a cause in which I passionately believed. I had assumed my fellow zombies would be too sensible to swallow the Leave nonsense and immigrant-scapegoating and vote to quit the EU. I realised that I \u2013 and all of us Bremainers/Bremoaners \u2013 deserved what I had got. Our arrogance had lost us the referendum. The neighbourhood in which I live had been festooned with Leave posters. The Leavers really wanted this and were prepared to make public their preference. In sporting parlance, they were up for it. The then Ukip leader Nigel Farage said his supporters would \u201ccrawl over broken glass\u201d to get to polling stations to vote to leave the EU, and he was right. Leave may not have had the arguments on their side, but they had all the energy. Remain, who didn\u2019t put up posters or show any passion for their cause, were supine in the face of their rhetoric. \u201cThe best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity.\u201d How right Yeats was. Does all this remind you of anyone? Trump may talk nonsense a lot of the time, but there\u2019s no denying his energy, passion and rhetorical skill. I watched several of the debates involving the Republican hopefuls, and he was incredibly bullish and entertaining. There was no denying he was box office. In an age increasingly suspicious of technocrats, and with people in the \u201csqueezed middle\u201d struggling to stay afloat and looking for simple solutions, Brexit/Trump is an attractive proposition. All of which led me to the phase I\u2019m now at \u2013 believing that I\u2019m as guilty as every other Remainer (except the guy with the clipboard) for the catastrophe of 23 June, and eager to join the battle to rectify the mistake. We had a referendum in 1975 to stay in the forerunner of the EU; we decided to leave in 2016. In my book that makes the referendum score 1-1, and there is still all to play for. I believe (perhaps naively) that once people see the damage leaving would do to the UK economically and politically, sentiment will change. I will do all I can to help shift that sentiment \u2013 writing pro-EU articles, arguing the Remain cause, getting involved in some of the pro-Remain organisations now springing up. We are the insurgents now; we have the passion and the energy. The Leavers are in the ascendant, but defence can be harder than attack if the attackers are determined, as we will have to be. In this third phase, following denial and anger, I have never felt so energised. I have found a cause in which I truly believe \u2013 openness, tolerance, togetherness, economic growth for our common social good. I am even typing this in a T-shirt that displays the 12 stars on a blue background that signify the European Union. I feel I owe it to that student who worked so hard while the rest of us did nothing. He saw the danger of defeat; we arrogantly assumed life would go on as normal. The things that matter in life have to be fought for. So if Trump does win, it\u2019s your fault. Just as I have to recognise that I am partly responsible for Brexit, so you would have to recognise you are responsible for Trump and Trumpism (or is it Trumpery?). And for you, as for me, the only response to that realisation is to change your ways and fight. Unlike Brexit, where us Bremoaners have an outside chance of being able to reverse the decision, or at least to argue for a Brexit so soft that you will barely discern what has changed after our exit from the EU, you would be stuck with Trump for four years (unless you find grounds for impeachment, which might indeed be possible). But you still have to fight. From day one of a Trump presidency, work for the America that is as good as you want it to be. Join campaigning organisations; find (or found!) a political party that reflects your views; get involved in a social group that is working for greater equality and an end to deprivation in your town. You are stuck with Trump, but you can still oppose, negate and eventually destroy Trumpism (assuming the new president doesn\u2019t destroy us all first in his version of the last Trump). Nothing is written in stone, and individuals can make a difference. A train might look as if it\u2019s inevitably running to a destination, but people lay the tracks. We decide the route. The lesson I\u2019ve learned from the past few months is that denial and anger achieve nothing. The only thing that will make a difference \u2013 and make you feel better about the situation \u2013 is to vow that this will not stand. I will fight the reactionary, small-minded thinking that underpins Brexit. You must fight the manifest absurdities of Trumpism. Make America great again in your own way. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2016. A previous version said a referendum was held in 1975 to join the the forerunner of the EU; it backed the UK staying in."
"24||Good eggs: the health news that vindicated my 25-a-week habitFew things scared Alfred Hitchcock as much as eggs. He was so revolted by their texture, and so afraid of oozing yolks (bafflingly, he would have preferred them to be red) that you might suspect The Birds was originally going to be The Chickens. Still, he wasn\u2019t alone. Since the 1950s, especially, eggs have been one of the most divisive foodstuffs in culinary history, see-sawing between health scares and health joys, and culminating in this week\u2019s news, from the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, that eating an egg a day can cut the chance of a stroke. Vindication! Let\u2019s all have an egg and sleep easy. Still, I don\u2019t need this as encouragement. I am very keen on eggs, stroke-defying or not, and their reputation as anything other than perfect has long baffled me. I eat between 20 and 25 a week. I have most of them for breakfast (boiled, a little salt, a slice of toast). The rest I carry in my bag, which now permanently smells like a Ziploc full of frittata. Even for those less monomaniacally inclined, though, the news does raise a wider question: where are we with eggs? Are these little ovoids in the ascendant? Are they shortening our lives or prolonging them? I realise that 20-plus a week might not be not a reasonable amount of eggs to eat, socially speaking. But nutritionally it is, apparently, \u201cfine\u201d, according to Lucy Egerton, of the British Egg Information Service, who floats the idea that 12 a day (84 a week!) is the kind of intake worth worrying about. Eg(g?)erton reassures us that, as long as you remember you cannot live on eggs alone, they\u2019re a very healthy food. And anyway, eating 12 eggs a day is not humanly possible \u2013 something I learned the hard way. My ardour for eggs began for health reasons. A few years ago, wanting to try a protein-heavy breakfast, I switched to eggs, because: 1) they are the perfect protein, containing all the amino acids we need, along with various other minerals and vitamins B and D; 2) they are relatively cheap; and 3) they have the lowest carbon footprint of any animal protein. (This was not a factor for me, really, but I still use it as in my defence.) Suffice to say that my life changed immeasurably. I felt better, slept better and the change dovetailed with my getting my first work contract. I\u2019m not saying the two were linked, but it\u2019s feasible. This reliance has become, at times, a prison \u2013 or cage, if you will \u2013 since I need them every day, to the point that I once smuggled a box on board a flight to China in case China didn\u2019t have eggs (it did). But generally, as one of the most globally ubiquitous foods, they are rarely hard to find, so I\u2019m usually OK. Happily for me, 2016 has been a good year for the egg (if existentially threatening in most other ways), in that we are eating more of them: sales were up again in the first quarter of 2016, following several years of growth. Sophie Missing, co-author of The Little Book of Brunch, suggests a piqued interest in the provenance of food as one reason: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that people are more interested [in provenance today], and that might mean eating meat that is ethically reared and costs more, [and eating it] less often.\u201d Eggs, she says, are an excellent substitute. Still, past vilifications have meant that, until recently, eggs had become a very British scapegoat. It wasn\u2019t their fault; or rather, it was \u2013 owing to their physical composition, you can measure things such as cholesterol in eggs more efficiently than in other foods. They were hoisted by their own petard (or canard, if duck eggs are your bag). In the past, it was thought that people should limit the number of eggs they eat because they contain cholesterol, but according to Egerton \u201ccurrent evidence suggests that dietary cholesterol does not increase the risk of heart disease in most healthy people\u201d. Since then, recommendations on limits have been relaxed. Then there was the salmonella scare of the late 1980s, which you can, of course, trace back to Edwina Currie. Some 28 years ago, she raised alarm over the link between salmonella and eggs, which prompted one of the biggest health scares in recent British history. I gave her a ring, and asked her how she feels about it now: no regrets, she said. \u201cI had no choice. The public wasn\u2019t aware of it. And as a health minister, I had to.\u201d Currie\u2019s declaration that most British egg production was infected with salmonella led to the slaughter of more than 2m chickens and, a fortnight later, her resignation. Sales in eggs went down 60% overnight, according to the British Egg Industry Council, which you could forgive for still being a bit touchy about it. Whatever their feelings, by 1989 it had been established that there was some truth in Currie\u2019s fears; a subsequent investigation led to a change in hygiene and storage and, later, the introduction of the British Lion safety mark, which now applies to almost 90% of UK-produced eggs. \u201cDo I take credit? No. The egg industry worked incredibly hard. You could say they did a cracking good job,\u201d Currie said with a laugh. \u201cMy only wish is that they would do the same for chicken.\u201d Currie still enjoys eggs, \u201cmainly eggs Benedict, which I\u2019ll have at the weekend or at a hotel when I can stare into the eyes of a waiter and confidently order them\u201d. She also wonders whether my intake prompts a need for some sort of laxative. In the 1950s, the UK Egg Marketing Board coughed up \u00a312m on advertising, including an inspired slogan chosen by no less a figure than Fay Weldon, which told us to \u201cgo to work on an egg\u201d. The child in one of the ads is eating two, fried, but I routinely go to work on three, boiled; or rather, I eat three at work \u2013 a routine apparently so laughable to my colleagues that I am now forced to go and eat them in the office canteen because of the smell. But I continue, defiant, and have no intention of stopping. My previous career in food journalism taught me that posh kitchens use Burford Browns. These cost about 40p an egg \u2013 peanuts, really, when you think of the nutritional content, and cheap in comparison to some of the other big players. Eggs from Riverdog Farm in California\u2019s Capay Valley cost around \u00a31 per egg, and you\u2019re not allowed to buy more than a dozen at a time. At the farmers\u2019 market there, there is a reliably long queue for them. According to Country Living, some of the best eggs come from Light Sussex hens, a breed prone to foraging, which makes for an especially creamy yolk. I have yet to try them, but the day is young. It\u2019s easy to become bookish about eggs, but to me, they symbolise more than just nutrition. They are readymade gifts from nature. In 2009 the Japanese author Haruki Murakami used the egg as a metaphor for the human spirit, in his acceptance speech at the Jerusalem Prize for the Freedom of the Individual in Society: \u201cEach of us is an egg, a unique soul enclosed in a fragile egg.\u201d A memorable Garfield sketch shows Garfield and Jon, his owner, staring blankly at a cooked egg before disposing of it after thinking too much about where it came from. But it is precisely this \u2013 its rich paradox in existing as both foodstuff and embryo \u2013 that has allowed the egg to become a cultural marker. At least two egg-centric restaurants \u2013 Bad Egg and The Good Egg \u2013 have opened in London in recent years, and then there\u2019s Instagram, where more than 40% of food pictures feature an egg, or so the BEIC claims. It\u2019s staggering to think that, as a millennial, I have never posted such an image. The only risk of a return to peak egg vilification is posed by the rise in veganism. Still, as Missing explains, \u201cvegganism\u201d might split the difference: \u201cI think people will make their own choices, but the positives of eggs \u2013 relatively cheap, accessible, filling, good for you \u2013 are pretty overwhelming.\u201d As to how that pans out, time will tell. For me, though, the thought of children never knowing the joy of an omelette is worrying. Incidentally, Hitchcock had never even eaten an egg when he lashed out at them. The poor fool. \u2022This article was amended on 4 November to state that sales of eggs declined by 60% (not 40%) overnight after the 1988 salmonella scare."
"5||Woman who gave birth in her car gets $7,400 bill for hospital delivery roomPaula D\u2019Amore was never expecting to give birth in the backseat of her Jeep. A few hours after she felt a contraction on 7 April, she loaded into the car and her husband started driving to the hospital, only to feel a burning sensation as the car pulled into its driveway. \u201cNever in a million years would I have thought this would happen,\u201d D\u2019Amore said. Her husband ran into the hospital to tell the staff his wife was in labor. As he came back and opened the door, the baby began crowning and he was forced to deliver the head. Moments later, a few nurses joined at the car and a midwife helped complete the delivery of her newborn daughter, Danielle. Only after giving birth in her car was she taken to a recovery room because all the labor rooms at the Boca Raton regional hospital were full. Given that she gave birth in her car, D\u2019Amore was shocked to receive a hospital bill that charged her more than $7,400 for a delivery room. She is also disputing an additional $4,000 bill for a time her daughter spent in the neonatal intensive care unit. \u201cI laughed,\u201d she said when she got the bill. \u201cYou gotta be kidding right? How do you charge for something that you didn\u2019t do?\u201d D\u2019Amore and her husband switched to a $5,000 high deductible insurance package that she had saved up for in preparation for the pregnancy, so her expenses will be capped at $5,000 and she has not disputed payment for other services, including the midwife. But she refuses to accept the hospital room charges given that she gave birth in the car. \u201cI cannot swallow seeing that they have the audacity to charge $7,000,\u201d D\u2019Amore said. Labor and delivery are among the most expensive healthcare costs in the US. According to a 2013 study by Truven Health Analytics, the cost of childbirth in the US has tripled since 1996. Truven also found the average price of pregnancy and newborn care for a baby was approximately $30,000 for vaginal delivery, and $50,000 for a C-section. Delivery costs alone are an average of $10,000 and over more than $15,000 for a vaginal or C-section respectively, according to the International Federation of Health Plans (IFHP). After working with counsel provided by her husband\u2019s employer, she took her grievances to the hospital who said they found nothing wrong with the charges after two reviews. \u201cBoca Raton Regional Hospital has reviewed the matter, understands the concerns of this patient, and has previously attempted to resolve the outstanding balance concerns with the patient,\u201d Thomas Chakurda, vice-president of marketing at Boca Raton regional hospital, said in a statement. \u201cThe hospital appropriately bills for the medical services and care it provides and has determined that the level of care provided and billing were appropriate in this instance. We take all of Mrs D\u2019Amore\u2019s concerns seriously and are willing to review them further.\u201d"

"25||RE teacher who posted Islamophobic comments struck offA religious education teacher who posted Islamophobic comments on social media and attended a march organised by the far-right group Britain First has been struck off. Nicholas Hall, who taught at a comprehensive school in Leicester, admitted he had attended a march on one or more occasions, and also admitted posting a number of intolerant messages. Hall admitted a series of other matters, including allowing 12- and 13-year-old pupils to watch an 18-certificate film, accessing pornography on a school laptop, failing to take appropriate action when a pupil acknowledged taking drugs, and working as a security guard while on sick leave. A professional conduct panel concluded that he was guilty of \u201cunacceptable professional conduct\u201d and \u201cconduct which may bring the profession into disrepute\u201d. It also found that he had breached his responsibility not to undermine \u201cfundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law \u2026 and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs\u201d, and that his conduct had violated the rights of pupils. A number of teachers have been suspended or struck off as a consequence of their links with another far-right group, the British National party (BNP). One, Adam Walker, subsequently became leader of the party. However, Hall is thought to be the first teacher to be struck off because of his association with Britain First, which was formed three years ago by a number of former BNP members. The professional conduct panel ordered that Hall be banned indefinitely from teaching in any school, sixth-form college or other children\u2019s establishment in England. He has a right of appeal to the high court. Hall, 53, had been teaching at Soar Valley College since 2001. The panel decided there was evidence that he had attended a number of rightwing events and that he had shown \u201cvehement intolerance\u201d towards people of other faiths. Comments he made on social media included \u201cWhat a sick religion Islam is\u201d and \u201cWe will leave them alone when the plague of Islam is [eradicated] from our planet.\u201d In its report, the professional conduct panel said: \u201cThe panel believes that such an attitude is completely incongruous with Mr Hall\u2019s role as a teacher, but particularly his role as an RE teacher of the college.\u201d Furthermore, the panel had seen no sign that Hall felt any remorse for his actions. Following the decision, Hall said he had no comment to make other than that he had \u201cmoved on\u201d since losing his job. Julie Robinson, the principal at Soar Valley College, said: \u201cMr Hall no longer works at the school and has not done so for some time. As soon as we became aware of any concerns regarding conduct, immediate appropriate actions were taken. This included referral to the misconduct panel, which has resulted in the recent outcome.\u201d On Thursday the deputy leader of Britain First, Jayda Fransen, was fined \u00a31,200 and ordered to pay \u00a3720 costs after being convicted of religiously aggravated harassment and wearing a political uniform. This is an offence under 1930s legislation that was aimed at the so-called blackshirts of the British Union of Fascists. Luton magistrates court saw CCTV and video clips that showed Fransen and a small number of men marching through Bury Park, an area of the town with a large Muslim population, wearing green jackets and hats bearing the Britain First emblem and carrying white crosses. Fransen could be heard berating a Muslim woman out shopping with her four young children, shouting that Muslim men compelled her to wear a hijab so she would not be raped. Fransen denied the offence, claiming she had not intended her words to be offensive. She attended court with a number of Britain First supporters, some of whom manhandled journalists during the two days that she was on trial. One person was arrested over an alleged assault."
"8||Winter happiness, election worries and word of 2016 \u2013 Guardian Social as it happenedWe\u2019ll be back next week with another live look at the week as it happened \u2013 in the meantime you can continue the discussion below the line or get in touch via sarah.marsh@theguardian.com or matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with any feedback or ideas for what you\u2019d like to talk about. The annual addition of neologisms to the various dictionaries has become a bit of a party game, with \u201csquee\u201d, \u201cgender-fluid\u201d and \u201cmoobs\u201d among the 1,200 new words added to the Oxford English Dictionary this Autumn. When we wrote about it in September, Brexit \u2013 and its numerous derivatives \u2013 had not yet made the cut, but this week the Collins Dictionary made good, naming Brexit the word of the year, ahead of Hygge and Trumpism. It\u2019s a word further down the list that caught my eye: \u201csharenting\u201d \u2013 the oversharing of pictures of offspring on social media by proud parents. Like Brexit, it carries a a big social load, the consequences of which are likely to be felt far into the future by those over-sharented kids. It set me thinking about \u201cbig\u201d and \u201clittle\u201d words - the trivial and ephemeral versus those that will become significant cultural markers. Any other suggestions? A suggestion here (see 15:20) With the Guardian tracking social workers Debbie Greaves and Jim McGrath on a stand-up tour based on their often difficult day jobs, plus Jo Brand\u2019s TV series Damned offering plentiful moments to wince on Channel 4, social work and its dealings with troubled folk are in the comedy spotlight. But is it important that those creating this sort of comedy have personal experience at the sharp end? (Brand worked for many years in psychiatric nursing.) Can any decent writer wring comic gold from a difficult subject through imagination and a bit of research alone \u2013 or is that the route to an offensive comedy pig\u2019s ear? In response to our colleague Martin Belam below the line a reader shares their commendation ... Who is Dave the earthworm? Sad news folks \u2013 that should have been who was Dave the earthworm ... On the subject of homework ... Earlier in the week I wrote a piece about the Good Housekeeping Institute\u2019s claim that there are 10 household chores you need only do once a year. They made it sound as if they were cutting us all some slack, but there were chores on their list I simply hadn\u2019t heard of - who wipes down their lightbulbs? It turns out my lightbulbs are pretty dirty, but I was happier not knowing. Given the comments, it seemed a lot of people felt the same way - that if you can get away with not doing a chore for a whole year, then it can probably wait another year, or ten. Just last night I went to see a stand-up who quoted one of her ex-husband\u2019s frequent criticisms - \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you wash a door,\u201d he said. Before that, the idea had never occurred to her. What household chores have you escaped through sheer ignorance of their existence? Come and spoil it for the rest of us. Parents in Spain are protesting over the level of homework that is set for their children. A 2012 found that Spanish 15-year-olds have 6.5 hours of homework a week, nearly one-and-a-half hours more a week than the average. And children from the ages of three to six in the country are apparently doing half an hour\u2019s homework every day. Parents are being given letters to send to schools by a campaign group, urging headteachers not to set homework. It is a touchy subject for parents. I don\u2019t remember having any homework until I was in secondary school, but my seven year old daughter has a \u201chomework menu\u201d which she can choose to do some things from each half-term. She\u2019s also expected to do reading at home nearly every night. It isn\u2019t over-burdensome, but it does sometimes take a chunk out of our weekend when we could be doing things that are perhaps a bit more fun for all the family. We asked readers from around the world what they thought of the amount of homework given to their children. Craig in Romania told us \u201cMy son often stays up until midnight finishing off homework\u201d and Zainab from London said \u201cMy son is constantly stressed about work and no longer sees learning as fun.\u201d What do you think? Do children get too much homework? Does it impact on family life too much? Or should kids just knuckle down and get on with it? On polls, here\u2019s something from data journalist Caelainn Barr. Donald Trump has been gaining ground in the polls since the announcement by the FBI that it has discovered new emails that may relate to Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private server during her time as secretary of state. One of the problems with many of the polls we\u2019ve seen this week is the margin of error, or by how many points the polls could be wrong. In most cases this has been greater than the lead taken by either candidate. As Trump and Clinton make their final campaign push in key swing states what now ultimately matters is who goes out and votes next Tuesday and the narrowing polls could help boost turnout. But how about something that could make make a lot of people very unhappy? Here\u2019s James Walsh on the US election. It\u2019s been one of the most controversial US elections ever. After a seemingly endless campaign, pockmarked with moments of unprecedented outrage and farce, decision day is nearly upon us. Barring a repeat of the 2000 election, when the Florida election recount delayed things somewhat, by this time next week either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton* will be in the White House. A quick glance at our busy comments threads will reveal there\u2019s been a lot of anxiety about this election, both from our US readers and those watching nervously from afar.

"23||Jane Eyre facsimile manuscript to be published for 'Bront\u00eb bibliophiles'A facsimile of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s 1847 manuscript of Jane Eyre, written in the author\u2019s flowing hand, will be published for the first time in December. This edition of the earliest surviving copy of Bront\u00eb\u2019s classic joins a roster of facsimiles published by the French press \u00c9ditions des Saints P\u00e8res, including Madame Bovary, Les fleurs du mal and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The reproduction is accompanied with etchings by Edmund Garrett from an edition published in 1897. According to the publisher, the fair copy is \u201cneat, with most notable revisions and corrections centred around her portrayal of Jane\u2019s encounters with Mr Rochester\u201d. Bront\u00eb had received a letter from the publisher Smith and Elder in August 1847, rejecting her first novel, The Professor, but suggesting that \u201ca work in three volumes would [be met] with careful attention\u201d. She replied with the 824-page manuscript of Jane Eyre, which they published that October. Written under Bront\u00eb\u2019s pen name of Currer Bell, the manuscript is held by the British Library and is the only copy in existence. Claire Harman, author of Charlotte Bront\u00eb: A Life, welcomed the publication of a manuscript that she felt would appeal to the Bront\u00eb bibliophile. \u201cWhat we see is the end of a long process for Charlotte Bront\u00eb,\u201d Harman said, \u201cthe last edits and adjustments to a story that had been with her for several years and that she wanted to present in an almost perfect condition to bowl over the publishers who had been intrigued but ultimately dissatisfied with The Professor. The manuscript shows justifiable pride in her work and control of it \u2013 and carefully hides the hard graft she had gone through to get there.\u201d The Parisian publishing house said that \u201cdue to the technical challenges of reproducing it, to date the manuscript has never before been published\u201d, adding that \u201cBront\u00eb\u2019s elegant handwriting and thoughtful edits showcase the author\u2019s genius and determination\u201d. \u00c9ditions des Saints P\u00e8res co-founder Nicholas Tretiakow hailed the novel as \u201ca compelling gem of English literature, a novel so many of us hold close to our hearts\u201d. \u201cWe wanted to rise to the challenge and offer this beautiful and rich manuscript to the public for the very first time,\u201d he said. Tretiakow\u2019s co-founder Jessica Nelson said that the pair were inspired to set up the press after attending an exhibition of manuscripts and first drafts in Paris 10 years ago. \u201cWe were totally moved and astounded by what we saw. We already had a passion for literature but we were astonished,\u201d she said. \u201cNicholas said that in 10 years\u2019 time we would create our own publishing house and specialise in the production of manuscripts, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\u201d According to Nelson, print runs are limited to 1,000 or 2,000 copies per book, with reproductions aimed at bibliophiles, collectors and those passionate about a particular author. The Jane Eyre copies will be priced at more than \u00a3200, and \u00c9ditions des Saints P\u00e8res plans to follow the novel\u2019s release with further titles in English next year. \u201cThere is a sense in this ever increasingly digital world that the value of handwriting and handwritten craft has never been so precious,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s another reading experience \u2013 you really feel something very intimate, you create an intimacy with the writer, even a writer who has been gone for centuries. A particular bond is created when you discover a manuscript.\u201d Nelson said she had felt the bond in particular when working on the publisher\u2019s edition of Proust\u2019s A la recherche du temps perdu. \u201cHe had terrible handwriting, and it was really difficult to read him, and when I was first working on the manuscript I was quite angry, because it was so difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after a few weeks I realised I could understand him, and I felt close to him.\u201d"
"7||Nutella campaigns in the US to be labeled a 'spread', not a 'topping'Do you eat Nutella by the spoonful? Or just spread it on toast? The answer to that question might seem like an intensely private matter, but it is one that is currently being studied by regulators at the US Food and Drug Administration, which is asking consumers how much of the famous Italian nut-cocoa concoction they eat, in an attempt to determine whether Nutella is a \u201cspread\u201d or a \u201ctopping\u201d. The answer could lead to a change in how Nutella is labeled in the US \u2013 which in turn could make it more attractive to calorie-conscious consumers. Ferrero, the multibillion-euro behemoth Italian confectionery company behind Nutella, has launched an effort in Washington to change Nutella\u2019s current designation, which was established in 1993. Under current rules, Nutella is considered a \u201cdessert topping\u201d, along with fruits, syrups, spreads, marshmallow cream, nuts and dairy and non-dairy whipped toppings. Critically for Nutella, the designation, which the FDA said was based on a 1991 consumer survey that showed a \u201csignificant\u201d number of respondents used Nutella as a dessert topping for ice cream, meant that the average serving size was considered to be two tablespoons. The product\u2019s US label lists that this estimated serving size contains 11 grams of fat, or 17% of the daily recommended value, and 200 calories. If Ferrero gets its way, the FDA will soon change Nutella\u2019s designation so that the \u201cnut cocoa-based spread\u201d is regulated in the same way as honey, jams, jellies, fruit butter and molasses. The average portion size for those is one tablespoon. The change would therefore reduce by 50% the amount of fat and calories listed on Nutella\u2019s US nutritional label. The UK, France and Australia, among others, use the one tablespoon as an average serving size. Nutella, which is made with sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts and cocoa, has also provided the FDA with its own research suggesting that most people consumed about one tablespoon every time they ate Nutella, and that in about half of those occasions, it was eaten with bread. Ferrero cited a 2012 survey of 722 Nutella consumers that showed just 6% eat Nutella on its own. According to public documents listed on www.regulations.gov, Ferrero has been lobbying for the change since 2014 with the help of its attorneys, Washington law firm Hogan Lovells. A May letter from the law firm to the FDA requesting a meeting on the issue was signed by Joseph Levitt, a Hogan Lovells partner who previously served as the director of FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. In Italy, Nutella is ubiquitous, used both as a spread on bread, but also as a filling in flakey cornetti, Italy\u2019s version of croissants, in cookies, cakes and ice cream. In its coverage of the news, La Repubblica said a final decision would be made in two months \u201cand the pounds gained, accordingly\u201d."
"26||Innovation is the answer to a simple question 'Is there a better way'In a previous life, I was the innovation manager of a division of a multinational consumer goods company. Now, I run an NGO dedicated to fighting hunger. Both organisations need innovation. I think civil society organisations can learn quite a bit from business, from its processes, its instruments, its focus on results. One such concept is \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d. I don\u2019t mean the panicky talk of making our NGO world redundant that\u2019s so fashionable in development circles these days. What I mean is something new that creates a new market, in our case a new type of impact. Think of how Southwest Airlines made air travel affordable to normal people. None of the elements were new, but Southwest stripped the existing business model of flying down to the bare essentials of getting people from A to B. The concept of the low-cost airline was born, and a new market was created. The trick was not to focus on the perfect solution, but on the solution that was \u201cgood enough\u201d for the job at hand. At my NGO Welthungerhilfe (one of Germany\u2019s biggest), we\u2019re using the same good enough approach. We have drilled boreholes and built wells for over 50 years now. As you would expect from a German organisation, our wells would make any engineer proud. They aren\u2019t always the cheapest, but they get the job done, and they last. But durability isn\u2019t always the main problem. Sometimes, the problem is that you simply can\u2019t ship in material from the outside. Or, if you do, you don\u2019t get spare parts easily if the well does need to be repaired. Or you need trained experts to do the maintenance. In these cases, sometimes there is indeed a better way. In our case the good enough solution was a driller and a water pump made solely of locally available material that we developed and scaled with our partner organisation EMAS: a plastic tube and valves, galvanised steel, glass marbles. Nothing fancy, nothing more. It\u2019s about minimal material investment and maximum output. At a fraction of the cost of a normal well (in fact, our well costs only 15% of a standard well), this opens up a new market for individual households as opposed to the communities who could afford wells before. It builds a new value chain for parts, assembly and maintenance in the region where the wells are being used. It is adapted to local standards, both financially and technology-wise. Yes, the well has limitations (it operates best in sandy soil), but where conditions are right, it\u2019s good enough. In fact, so good enough that in Bolivia alone, more than 50,000 wells were built. We talk about technology innovation a lot, and we often mean high-tech solutions. But sometimes, innovation can be decidedly low-tech, and our manual pump is a case in point. Another NGO taking the good enough approach is AFRIpads, a social enterprise based in Uganda. AFRIpads focuses on one very clear issue: the absence of sanitary hygiene for girls which leads to high drop-out rates at school. The normal solution would be to sell sanitary pads, but that is costly and impracticable in many hard to reach villages. AFRIpads found a new solution by going back to basics. They have created reusable sanitary pads manufactured locally in Uganda by women in a firm that operates as a social enterprise and channels proceeds back into the company. A standard pad may have been the technically perfect solution, but the reusable one was good enough. It created both a market and millions of opportunities for girls who would otherwise suffer from stigmatisation during their periods. About 90% of all innovations fail. Companies spend a lot of money to test and qualify, but the development world doesn\u2019t have those kinds of resources, and most donors like to fund ideas that are the least likely to fail. So, how can we improve the odds? Making a virtue out of necessity sometimes works best. If you eliminate \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d as an alternative, your chances of successful adoption increase. Here\u2019s how this worked for us in Sierra Leone. Welthungerhilfe had offered farmer field schools for a long time and with quite some success: we trained cocoa farmers to nurse, plant, harvest and market their produce. Then Ebola hit in 2011. Suddenly, gatherings of more than five people were forbidden. It could have been the end of our farmer field schools, but it forced us to think again. It forced us to go digital. We developed a digital farmer school for illiterate farmers that combined training with women empowerment, certification and market links. The result: costs per farmer decreased by 90%. A potential scaling up of this could reach millions of cocoa smallholder farmers in Africa. We have now reapplied the model in other countries. In Kenya, it formed the basis of an electronic marketplace for cattle \u2013 we call it \u201ceBay for cows\u201d. In Zimbabwe, the model was used to build a digital agriculture extension service. The lessons learned for innovation in the development sector? For me there are three: the first is that disruptive innovation, the one that creates new markets, is based on the concept of good enough. Rather than go for the perfect solution, go for the cost-effective, smarter, leaner one. The second lesson is that, in order to get traction and maximise the odds of success, it pays to look for real problems on the ground, build up from what already exists, and try to eliminate the business as usualoption as an alternative. And lastly, that business tools such as the notion of disruptive innovation can be really useful in a development context. They have been created to sell more soap. Let\u2019s use them to help us solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing social problems. Let\u2019s not leave the sharpest tools in the box to the capitalists.

"23||Cormorance by Nick Hayes review \u2013 the healing power of natureHayes\u2019s last book, Woody Guthrie and the Dust Bowl Ballads, was an evocative account of a great wordsmith. His affecting new work is practically mute: the only speech bubbles contain the \u201cpreep\u201d, \u201ckreeyah\u201d and \u201ccaaaawk\u201d of birds. The animals frequent a disused London reservoir, setting its water and air a-tremor with a joyous cacophony. They form the dreamlike counterpoint to a boy and a girl whose separate voyages through childhood are derailed by bereavement. Hayes gives us pre-school routines, classroom tests, swimming lessons, busy streets and hospital wards, and the lack of words makes the nuances of his artwork \u2013 a sinuous arm reaching from mother to child, a raised eyebrow packed with both familiarity and fear \u2013 doubly significant. The reservoir comes to symbolise escape and possibility for both children, and as the story moves to its conclusion the appealing panels of school life broaden to show surreal panoramas of nature, in all its joy, mystery and marshy menace. Achingly sad at times and thoroughly joyful at others, this beautiful and distinctive book is a reminder that hope can nest in unexpected surroundings. \u2022 Cormorance is published by Jonathan Cape.

"6||Silencing of journalist draws huge backlash from Iranian publicThe silencing of a journalist who is being kept in solitary confinement after exposing corruption in Tehran\u2019s mayor\u2019s office is drawing a huge backlash in Iran and is being widely condemned as shooting the messenger. Yashar Soltani, the editor of Memari News, an architecture and urban development website, was arrested on 17 September after publishing a letter that showed the office of Tehran\u2019s mayor had sold or relinquished public land and apartments worth up to \u00a3500m to officials and members of the municipal council under extraordinary discounts and other favourable arrangements. Soltani\u2019s arrest came after the mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, an influential politician with a military background, and Mehdi Chamran, the chair of Tehran\u2019s city council, filed a suit against him. Judiciary officials later said he was arrested for publishing classified documents although others have questioned the veracity of the claim, saying that Memari News merely published what had been leaked and that it did not have any secret information. Soltani\u2019s detention, however, has brought the issue to the forefront of public consciousness in Iran. Before his arrest, the journalist was only known among the elites, particularly by those following architecture news, but his investigations and subsequent arrest have touched a nerve, prompting huge reactions across Iran. The revelations have embarrassed Ghalibaf, who has presidential ambitions and has put his name on the list as a candidate in the past. He has largely been seen as a successful mayor, transforming the city and pursuing ambitious plans, such as commissioning bold architecture in recent years. The leaks also impacted a number of municipal council members who were later named as the beneficiaries of the sale. The letter was written by the national inspection office, tasked with policing corruption in state sector, and was addressed to a senior official at the mayor\u2019s office, stating that the sale was illegal and giving an ultimatum for further clarifications. \u201cTehran\u2019s municipality has suffered losses of around 1.5tr rials [about \u00a333m] as the result of granting unfair and discriminatory concessions,\u201d the letter reads. It says that some beneficiaries received discounts of up to 50% on prices that had been undervalued in the first place. \u201cYashar Soltani is in jail merely for doing his job as a journalist and is now in Evin prison for revealing corruption in the municipality under Ghalibaf,\u201d tweeted one Iranian. Omid Memarian, an Iranian journalist, wrote that Soltani\u2019s detention showed that the authorities were not serious about tackling corruption and that \u201cin reality they only target those who reveal corruption\u201d. Another journalist, Yeganeh Khodami, said Tehran badly needed journalists like Soltani to \u201cstay alive\u201d. Other users have been tweeting #FreeYashar to raise awareness about his plight. \u201cIn another country, he would have become a national hero, a symbol of investigative journalism, and would have dominated front pages. In Iran? Solitary confinement,\u201d wrote one. Soltani, speaking to the local Nazar News a few days before his arrest, spoke about the pressure he was facing and said that whether the sale had been legal or illegal, the public had the right to know about it. Access to Memari News was blocked before his arrest and the website was still inaccessible on Friday. \u201cThere has been a lot of pressure on me, heavy pressure, but that\u2019s not important, I have no regrets,\u201d Soltani told Nazar News at the time. \u201cWhat belonged to the public was distributed among certain people, and no matter [if] it was done legally or illegally, it was my duty to let the people know given the taxes they pay, they should have known this much earlier ... I am prepared to pay the costs\u201d Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, said: \u201cThe Tehran prosecutor\u2019s suspension of a website for publishing an official letter is a blatant abuse of power aimed at suppressing media organisations that are trying to keep officials accountable for their actions.\u201d The new revelations have come at a sensitive time in Iran, where a few months ago another scandal surrounding vast salaries paid to government officials prompted nationwide fury. It led to the resignation of a number of senior officials, including the head of the state insurance regulator. The public anger at Soltani\u2019s arrest has been such that even a number of MPs, in a rare expression of solidarity with imprisoned journalists, have come to his defence. The outspoken MP Ali Motahari, who is allied with the reformists politically but has conservative social views, criticised his incarceration and said journalists should not resort to self-censorship under pressure. Up to 700 journalists have written to the judiciary calling for Soltani\u2019s release, the semi-official Ilna news agency said. There was also outrage about reports that Soltani appeared to have been forced to disclose the source of the leaked document. Tehran\u2019s prosecutor announced that the journalist, while in jail, had named a member of Tehran\u2019s city council as the whistleblower. Ahmad Hakimipour later confirmed he had leaked the letter to Soltani. Reverberations from Soltani\u2019s revelations continued after his arrest. Many beneficiaries complained that they had not done anything illegal and that their names were being tarnished. Last month, a member of the municipal council, Abolfazl Ghena\u2019ati, in widely condemned comments, attacked Soltani, saying: \u201cHis sister should be given to Daesh [Islamic State] for one week so he would understand.\u201d Late in October, Iran\u2019s prosecutor general said on state television that 45 individuals had received properties from the mayor\u2019s office under illegal arrangements. At least 36 contracts were reported to have been annulled."
"22||Ex-police chief Gordon Anglesea jailed for child sexual abuseA former police superintendent has been jailed for 12 years for sexually abusing vulnerable boys in the 1980s at a Home Office attendance centre for young offenders and at a children\u2019s home. Gordon Anglesea, 79, is the highest-profile offender brought to justice through the National Crime Agency\u2019s Operation Pallial, which has been investigating allegations of widespread and organised child abuse in north Wales. Anglesea has faced claims for a quarter of a century that he preyed on young boys, and in the mid-90s was awarded \u00a3375,000 in damages after successfully suing news organisations including the Observer that had linked him to abuse. At that time he depicted himself as an old-fashioned north Wales officer who had been inspired by the fictional neighbourhood policeman Dixon of Dock Green. But in victims\u2019 impact statements put before Mold crown court in north Wales on Friday, one victim said: \u201cAnglesea was the worst. He was the man I feared most.\u201d A second said he had several times tried to kill himself because he couldn\u2019t live with the memories of what \u201cthat man\u201d had done to him. Anglesea, a father of five, continued to protest his innocence. His barrister, Tania Griffiths QC, said the verdicts were \u201cperverse\u201d and unsuccessfully applied for her client to be freed on bail while he sought an appeal. Griffiths said Anglesea and his family could lose his police pension and asked the judge to be as \u201chumane\u201d as possible because jail would be so difficult for him. There were cheers from the public gallery as the judge Geraint Walters passed sentence and told Anglesea his victims had been vulnerable young people with nobody to turn to for help. Walters said: \u201cYou do not need me to say that as a person whose obligation it was to uphold the law and protect the vulnerable, your offences against those vulnerable boys grossly abused the trust placed in you. The consequences for them has been profound, indeed life-changing.\u201d Anglesea was found guilty of indecent assaults on two boys aged 14 and 15. One said he had been assaulted by Anglesea in the shower and a changing room at the attendance centre he ran in Wrexham. Such centres were set up by the Home Office to provide an alternative to custody for youths, and provided physical training and woodwork lessons. The second victim lived at a children\u2019s home called Bryn Estyn in Wrexham. He claimed he was taken from there to various addresses and passed around \u201clike a handbag\u201d to men including Anglesea. North Wales police has apologised for Anglesea\u2019s actions and said it has changed the way it investigates such offences. In 1994, Anglesea sued the Observer, Private Eye, the Independent on Sunday and the Welsh broadcaster HTV over allegations connecting him to abuse. During libel hearings at the high court, Anglesea, then in his late 50s and living in a seaside town in north Wales, was portrayed as a stalwart of the community, a Freemason, Rotarian, Methodist and a school governor. The news organisations called evidence from three young men who claimed to have been Anglesea\u2019s victims while they were teenagers at Bryn Estyn. Anglesea persuaded the jury of his innocence and he was awarded damages. The papers and broadcaster were left with a \u00a31m legal bill. One of the libel trial witnesses, Mark Humphries, 30, killed himself two months after giving evidence against Anglesea. In 2012, the National Crime Agency launched Pallial at the height of the swirl of false allegations linking the Tory peer Lord McAlpine to child abuse in the Wrexham area. Its mission was to look at the allegations of sexual abuse within the care system in north Wales that once again surfaced during the scandal, which was triggered by a Newsnight report. More than 300 people made contact with the investigation, dozens have been arrested and scores of complaints are being investigated. It is no surprise that so many people came forward. During the Sir Ronald Waterhouse inquiry in 1997, almost 300 men and women named 148 abusers including police officers, social workers, local authority executives, senior businessmen and politicians. Waterhouse ordered that they could not be identified by the media. Among those who have been convicted through Pallial are John Allen, a care home owner who was jailed for life, and a gang of five including a former professional wrestler, a radio presenter and a civil servant, who were found to be members of a predatory paedophile ring that abused vulnerable boys. A number of former residents of the Bryn Estyn children\u2019s home in Wrexham were in court to see Anglesea sentenced."
"27||'A clown is innocent': Philippe Gaulier tips a bucket of water over creepy crazeSchools were barricaded, Halloween celebrations banned. Knife-wielding \u201ccreepy clowns\u201d have been terrorising the citizenry of suburban America and Europe. What\u2019s it all about? And whither the art form of Grimaldi and Grock, of Chaplin and, er, Krusty from The Simpsons? Who better to ask than the world-renowned clown teacher Philippe Gaulier, whiskery homunculus of funny to whose ashram in \u00c9tampes, Paris, wannabe comedy stars flock. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d says Gaulier via Skype from \u00c9tampes. Notoriously brusque, the clown guru isn\u2019t wasting words on the craze. \u201cIt\u2019s just gangsters taking the mask of clowns to be gangsters. Some people put on police costumes to be gangsters. Bon,\u201d he croaks, sending a great Gallic shrug coursing down my broadband. \u201cIt\u2019s just that gangsters change how they work.\u201d South-west of Paris, it seems, is blissfully immune to the white-faced, red-nosed terror that has swept the western world. But not to coulrophobia (fear of clowns) generally, which Gaulier acknowledges \u2013 if not for the reasons you\u2019d expect. \u201cSome children are scared because the clown, for example, breaks plates or does something forbidden. So the children go \u2018Aaargh! Your family is going to be pissed off because you break plates!\u2019\u201d I\u2019m not sure Gaulier has the full measure of the current clown terror. \u201cI once did a 10-minute TV routine in Switzerland with my partner Pierre Byland,\u201d he says. \u201cWe broke 20 plates, and the children who watched it did the same at home, breaking all their family\u2019s plates. It was a scandal!\u201d I\u2019m not sure that crockery was foremost in the mind of the eight-year-old Swedish boy who leapt from a balcony last month to escape a clown-costumed intruder. But Gaulier may be on to something: the idea that clowns are beyond social norms, anarchic bordering on transgressive. But surely it\u2019s the inhuman painted face, the lurid wigs and candy-coloured costumes that give us the heebie-jeebies. \u201cThe makeup is sometimes exaggerated,\u201d he confesses, \u201cand it could create some fear for young children.\u201d \u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d says Gaulier, who is now 73, \u201cI saw the best clown in Paris, in Cirque d\u2019hiver. In those days, the spotlights were really primitive, there were two thousand of us and we didn\u2019t see the clowns very well, so they had to exaggerate the makeup.\u201d To a grotesque degree? \u201cOui, grotesque,\u201d he says. White-face clown tends to be credited to the legendary pre-Victorian pantomime act Joseph Grimaldi, the tension between whose depressive personality and leering features is the sine qua non of the scary (or, at least, unsettling) clown. But Gaulier traces its origin further back. \u201cLike the white face of a mime, it comes from the colour of flour. Always the village idiot in rural life was falling down in the flour, and he would come away completely white, and everyone would say, \u2018Ho ho, he\u2019s the village idiot\u2019 \u2013 or the clown.\u201d But painted face, rainbow-hued jumpsuit, outsize shoes \u2013 these are yesterday\u2019s news in clown world, says Gaulier. \u201cThat\u2019s more or less finished. As a teacher, I like to work with a red nose because, when a student puts one on, I see better how he was when he was a child. But, outside of school, I don\u2019t so much like clown costumes, makeup, red nose.\u201d As the creepy clown craze continues, he\u2019s not alone. \u201cOnce a student has discovered his clown,\u201d Gaulier concludes, \u201cI love it when he no longer announces with his outfit, \u2018Hello, I\u2019m a clown\u2019. A clown doesn\u2019t need any of that stuff: a clown is innocent.\u201d"
"8||Who pretends to support kids with HIV but gives nothing? Donald TrumpIt\u2019s fashionable to dismiss all politicians as equally disappointing, unprincipled or simply venal. Since the system is gridlocked and out of touch, surely that means they\u2019re all just as bad as each other. But amid the wreckage of the political class, Donald Trump is different \u2013 and not just because of his politics or his rhetoric. He is in a class of his own, taking narcissism and amorality to a whole new level. You don\u2019t need a trove of leaked emails to understand just how different Donald is. You just need to get to know the Trump Foundation a little better. Thanks to the dogged reporting of the Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold, we can do just that. It\u2019s not pretty reading. Trump and his supposedly charitable works are a grotesque distortion of philanthropy, a word whose roots come from the Greek for loving people. Judging from his philanthropy, Trump mostly loves one person, whose name just happens to be Donald. Instead of donating to a foundation with any meaningful purpose, Trump invested in his favorite pastime: inflating his self-image. This is his life\u2019s work, whether it\u2019s the Trump brand of business, politics or charity. The product is the same: an artificial version of Donald Trump. Take the 1997 story of when he was principal of a Bronx public school for a day. It was a cute program designed to boost struggling schools in New York City, and the supposedly wealthy property developer delighted in the scene. The school chess team was holding a bake sale to raise $5,000 to pay for travel to go to a tournament. Trump handed them a fake million-dollar bill. After making them the butt of his joke, Trump wrote them a real check for just $200. What kind of person mocks the students he is supposed to be helping? A man who shows up uninvited, a year earlier, to the opening of a nursery school for children with HIV/Aids. Trump sat on stage, pretending to be a donor, when he had given nothing. Not a penny. He posed for photos alongside then mayor Rudy Giuliani and the developer who actually donated generously to build the school. Then he simply drove away, having done nothing. That\u2019s Donald Trump. The man whose charitable foundation buys giant portraits of himself to hang in his own golf resort. The Post called more than 400 charities with some connection to Trump. It found just one gift from Trump in the past eight years: to the Police Athletic League of New York City, for less than $10,000. Trump\u2019s charity would not matter if he didn\u2019t brag about it so much. The scrutiny began when he skipped a primary debate as part of his petty feud with Fox News, staging a fundraiser for veterans instead. Trump promised to give $1m to the cause, but the money only materialized after months of media questions. For all his boasting about his foundation, most of the money came from outside donors, not from Trump himself. Normally you\u2019d say this kind of man has no shame. It\u2019s true: and that\u2019s exactly how Trump has managed to get to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America. Shameless is the way he won the primaries. Where other candidates were mildly restrained in their Muslim-baiting and nativist nightmares, Trump could always take things beyond the extreme. No previously elected official could trash Mexico and demand payment for a border wall. Shameless is the way he has conducted himself as a nominee. He has picked fights with a Gold Star family and promised to lock up his political rival without due process. He has praised Russia while attacking his opponent for supposedly jeopardizing national security. And it turns out that a good chunk of Republicans like his shamelessness. They confuse his rule-breaking for the kind of free spirit that will reform a broken system. A real reform candidate could have won this election in a landslide. A self-disciplined extremist could have rallied the disaffected masses to his candidacy. But Trump is no reformer and he has no self-discipline. He abused the tax system to convert corporate losses into personal tax benefits. Then he accused his rival of failing to stop his tax avoidance, when she actually voted to close the very loophole that he has exploited. Like the scrutiny of his foundation, the long IRS audits he suffers are entirely of his own making. Trump will no doubt cast such investigations as political revenge, long after this election is over. For now, Trump is like the arch villain of a dozen superhero movies: the more he is attacked, the stronger he gets. The only solution is the kryptonite of election defeat, because with it comes the ultimate public rejection. No matter how much the national polls fluctuate, the state-by-state polls represent a disaster for Trump. States that he needs to win such as Virginia and Pennsylvania are out of reach. States he needs to defend, such as North Carolina, remain in jeopardy. States that Republicans haven\u2019t needed to defend in decades, such as Georgia and Utah, are vulnerable. There is only one refuge left for a man like Donald Trump: the shameless undermining of the democratic process itself. He will challenge the election and its results. He will stir up conspiracies of fraudulent votes and rigged elections. He will delegitimize this country\u2019s political leaders in ways that will make Vladimir Putin very happy. And he will walk away from the disaffected voters who believed his promise that he would win so much they would get bored of winning. Because he\u2019s shameless."
"14||Times apologises for claiming tobacco firms funded e-cigarette researchThe Times has printed a full apology to five scientists for three articles that wrongly suggested tobacco companies funded their research into e-cigarettes. The newspaper had already apologised to one scientist named in reports, Clive Bates. However, four others, including the former government adviser David Nutt, last week said they were due an apology. At the time, all five said they would sue the newspaper for defamation. They have not decided whether to abandon the lawsuit following the apology. Nutt welcomed the apology but criticised the \u201ccommercial interests and ideologues\u201d he said were behind the article. \u201cWe are pleased that the Times has capitulated on this matter, but would have been happier if it had not indulged in this reckless reporting, which smeared the reputations of leading anti-tobacco academics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe battle to reduce the harm from tobacco is gradually being won, but it is being fought against commercial interests and ideologues like those who were behind these articles.\u201d The original stories and a leading article were published on 12 October with the headlines \u201cTobacco giants fund vaping studies\u201d, \u201cScientists wooed in charm offensive\u201d and \u201cSmoke in their eyes\u201d. One of the articles claimed that Cancer Research UK had criticised scientists who \u201caccepted thousands of pounds from tobacco companies to carry out research into e-cigarettes\u201d, and included a panel titled \u201cAcademics making a packet\u201d. As well as Nutt and Bates, it named Profs David Sweanor, Riccardo Polosa and Karl Fagerstr\u00f6m. The online versions of the articles have since been removed and replaced with the apology, which says the five were \u201cinternationally respected for their longstanding global work to reduce smoking and their work on the issue of nicotine harm reduction\u201d. It adds: \u201cOur report and panel \u2018Academics making a packet\u2019 implied that these experts had received funding for research into e-cigarettes. We accept that this was wrong and their work has not been tainted by the influence of tobacco industry funding. We apologise for our errors and omissions, and for the embarrassment caused.\u201d Sweanor, who works at the Centre for Health Law, Policy and Ethics at the University of Ottawa, told the Guardian the group had not yet decided whether to continue with the defamation suit. Despite what he described as lasting damage to his reputation, Sweanor said the main priority was moving on. \u201cThe interest is in simply getting it behind us,\u201d he said. \u201cMy view is that I would just let it go. You just have to move on and do good work, and people forget the bit of character assassination.\u201d The Times declined to comment on the apology."
"27||Jez Butterworth: playwright 'without equal' turns his gaze on the TroublesIt will come as no surprise to those who have followed Jez Butterworth\u2019s career that his new play, although set at the time of the hunger strike during the Troubles, takes place not in Belfast but in the countryside. Few details have been released, but The Ferryman will be set in rural Derry in 1981, where a multi-generational farming family is about to bring the harvest in and, said Butterworth this week, \u201cwhere the past comes back into the present in a way that shows it was never really buried\u201d. It will be a \u201cbig play\u201d, he said, \u201con the scale of Jerusalem\u201d, words that will quicken the heart of any theatre lover. Even the news that the play will be directed by Sam Mendes, with whom the writer has worked on the last two Bond films, wasn\u2019t greeted with the same excitement: a new Butterworth play is the draw. His previous plays, with the exception of his debut, Mojo, which was set in Soho, have remote backdrops or the liminal setting of the suburbia of his childhood. But this play may also signal a curious swerve. Butterworth seems such an English writer, suffused with English mythology, whether in the gangland folklore of 1950s London in Mojo or in The River, wherein a man and woman are holed up in a cabin on a fishing trip (the bait used to catch the trout is that very English of snacks, a pickled onion Monster Munch). His most famous hymn to England is the phenomenon that was his 2009 play Jerusalem, taking in as it does the very marrow of national identity: St George and Stonehenge, Jack-of-the-Green and the Queen, Morris dancers and pub car parks, custard creams, Pot Noodles and Little Chefs. Butterworth seems, says the Guardian\u2019s theatre critic, Michael Billington, \u201chaunted by the nature of Englishness: he constantly asks how we preserve ancestral memories and countryside rituals in an age of ribbon development and hi-tech advance.\u201d Audiences will be intrigued to see how he handles Irish history. Both of his parents were part Irish Catholics, though Butterworth was born in London and grew up, the second youngest of five, on a 1960s cul-de-sac in St Albans (two brothers are also writers, with whom Butterworth has worked; another is a producer and their late sister Joanne was registrar at the drama school Lamda). Butterworth grew up watching films, not plays. He said he watched \u201cthousands and thousands of hours of movies\u201d at home on television. \u201cI was going to the Odeon to see Rocky IV, or Fatal Attraction, films like that. And I remember thinking, \u2018This bit here could be better\u2019,\u201d he said in 2013 (later, he would do exactly that, brought in as a \u201cscript doctor\u201d to improve screenplays). At Cambridge, where he followed his older brother from comprehensive school, Butterworth discovered drama; he wrote a play based on Katharine Whitehorn\u2019s Cooking in a Bedsitter, which he and his brother Tom took to the Edinburgh fringe. After university, Butterworth worked briefly as an office boy in an advertising agency before he and Tom signed on, left London and lived an impoverished life in a cottage in a Wiltshire village (which would later serve as the model for Flintlock in Jerusalem) and focused on writing. They wrote a TV film, Christmas, together, and Butterworth created his first proper play, Mojo. It was, remembers Ian Rickson, who directed the play at the Royal Court, \u201ca thrilling first read. It had incredible verbal energy but a deep, mythic quality too\u201d. Rickson has directed all of Butterworth\u2019s plays \u2013 the writer\u2019s decision to elope with Mendes is a rarity \u2013 and Butterworth has said Rickson is \u201cthe most important thing in my career\u201d. Rickson says of his friend and collaborator: \u201cJez is completely consumed in his own unique universe, drawing from his personal mythology, reaching deep into the shadows, to generate his extraordinary plays.\u201d He recalls the first time he met the writer: \u201cHe looked dashing in a big black coat, was open, responsive, and seemed very ready to seize his moment. He did.\u201d Mojo was the first debut play to be staged in the theatre\u2019s main space since John Osborne\u2019s Look Back in Anger in 1956, and it was a success. At the time, Butterworth spoke about the pressure he felt to follow it up. \u201cYou are as tyrannised by your successes as you are by your failures,\u201d he said in 1996. \u201cYou can walk away from your failures, but you can\u2019t walk away from your successes \u2026 it is difficult to shed that kind of initial impact for the first thing you do, and get on and do the next.\u201d Butterworth didn\u2019t write another play for years (his next, The Night Heron, was staged at the Royal Court seven years later). In the meantime, he had started working in film \u2013 he wrote screenplays with his brother, directed the film version of Mojo and wrote and directed the film Birthday Girl, with Nicole Kidman as a \u201cmail-order\u201d Russian bride; neither did terribly well. There were also personal repercussions \u2013 Mendes had wanted to direct the Mojo adaptation. \u201cSam didn\u2019t talk to me for years afterwards,\u201d Butterworth later said. And a lot of the time was spent in the pub. In 2002, Butterworth explained his absence from the theatre: \u201cFor a long time I didn\u2019t feel that, if I sat down to write a play, I would have anything different or interesting to say, and I was damned if I was going to do the same thing again just because I could.\u201d Two more plays relatively quickly followed; he had started the play that would become Jerusalem but it wasn\u2019t working. Butterworth, who had moved back to London, left again for the countryside; he and his wife bought a smallholding and had two daughters. By the spring of 2009, the Royal Court had been booked and the company was expecting a play. Butterworth was struggling. His attention was also elsewhere (he was working on the film Fair Game). He left it to the very last minute, writing it within weeks. Mackenzie Crook met him on the first day of rehearsals for Jerusalem and says there wasn\u2019t even a finished script. \u201cHe came along with a skeleton of a script and an idea that he fully admitted he didn\u2019t know what it was yet,\u201d says Crook, who played Rooster\u2019s crony Ginger. \u201cThere were characters in there he thought weren\u2019t going to make it to the final cut. He would be in every day, watch us rehearse and come in the next day with some new pages and hand them over. The play evolved in that way.\u201d Of the writing, he says: \u201cIt blew me away how anyone could come up with these beautifully crafted lines, the rhythm of them. It was just a joy to read, and the easiest lines I\u2019ve ever had to learn. Badly written lines are almost impossible to learn, because the rhythm isn\u2019t accurate to how people speak.\u201d Rickson, explaining Butterworth\u2019s strong sense of rhythm says: \u201cHe often sees his plays as songs.\u201d Did Crook find the writing-on-the-fly process nerve-racking? \u201cIt was. In hindsight I should have relaxed and trusted it. [I wasn\u2019t] very experienced in theatre, it all seemed a little bit chaotic to me. I remember one day he came in and said it was going to be a three-act play with two intervals. I remember my heart sinking, thinking no one is going to come and see that, you can\u2019t ask people to sit through three hours. Of course, people flocked to see it and didn\u2019t even notice how long it was.\u201d Jerusalem \u2013 shown first at the Royal Court, and then in the West End, and on Broadway \u2013 was a mega-hit, with people queuing in the early hours of the morning to get tickets. For Mark Rylance, who played the lead, Johnny \u201cRooster\u201d Byron, the defiant demigod of dwindling power, it has become the defining stage performance of his career. Unlike the period after the success of his first play, Butterworth wasn\u2019t derailed by Jerusalem\u2019s blaze. \u201cThe hardest stage for a playwright is producing the second and third plays,\u201d says Rickson, \u201cparticularly after a big hit. Jez may have taken some time to process the success of his first play, but, crucially, has gone on to develop an enduring and compelling body of work.\u201d What themes obsess him? \u201cThe plays are often haunted by abandonment and betrayal, and the challenges of real intimacy.\u201d Butterworth is unusual in that he switches so easily between theatre and film \u2013 and not arthouse film, but blockbusters, such as the Bond franchise. \u201cScreenwriting and playwriting always strike me as like different sports that I can play,\u201d he has said. \u201cIt\u2019s like cricket and football; they don\u2019t really have much to do with each other except a lot of strenuous activity. I can go from doing a play to doing a screenplay and it\u2019s like one feeds the other in some way, I\u2019m not sure exactly how.\u201d The film director Doug Liman brought Butterworth in to work on the script of his film Mr and Mrs Smith. Nicole Kidman, who had originally been hired to star opposite Brad Pitt, had suggested the writer. \u201cThe script needed work,\u201d says Liman. \u201cThere was a draft of a script and it didn\u2019t have the humour that I wanted.\u201d Usually when an actor suggests a writer, he says, \u201cit\u2019s your worst nightmare. But in this case Jez came in with his brother John Henry and in three weeks they set a tone for the movie that ended up on screen. It was the single most positive experience I\u2019ve ever had of a writer coming in to rewrite a script.\u201d Liman and Butterworth worked together again on the spy drama Fair Game and the Tom Cruise sci-fi film Edge of Tomorrow. Butterworth, he says, \u201cis amazing at character, and amazing at story structure to bring out what is most interesting about that character.\u201d What is he like to work with? \u201cHe is brutally honest.\u201d When Butterworth was holed up in a New York hotel, struggling with the time travel intricacies in Edge of Tomorrow, he and Liman would meet up every day. \u201cI would criticise things that weren\u2019t working, and he would lash out viciously. And then at the end he told me \u2018if I ever lash out at you, attack you personally, it means I know I\u2019m wrong and you\u2019re right\u2019.\u201d Heated writer sessions are not unusual, but Butterworth\u2019s apology and self-awareness was, he says. \u201cThose who make more commercial movies are really lucky that there is somebody like Jez who so perfectly straddles both worlds. He doesn\u2019t really have an equal.\u201d Even in 2011, Butterworth said he still considered himself to be in \u201ca kind of apprenticeship\u201d, and as for where he stands within British playwriting history, Billington says he is hard to place, \u201cfor several reasons. One is that his theatrical output is still relatively small. Another is that we live at a time, I believe, when there is a plurality of voices rather than dominant playwriting figures as in the era of Osborne and Pinter. Having said that, Butterworth has an exceptional gift.\u201d We\u2019ll have to wait until next April to see what his new work brings, but in Jerusalem he has already written one great play, which is, points out Billington, \u201cmore than many dramatists do in a lifetime\u201d."

"16||\u2018I took his hand and got down on one knee\u2019: a policeman proposes at PrideAfter the homophobic attack in Orlando this year, the atmosphere at Pride in London was: \u201cYou can\u2019t win. You\u2019re not going to stop us.\u201d I\u2019m a police constable and I\u2019d volunteered to be at the parade. I spoke to a lot of people in the police force about whether it was a good idea for me to do a surprise proposal to my boyfriend, Johnny, during the parade. Everyone was so supportive. It was significant for me because I joined the police after being brutally assaulted on my 18th birthday because of a public display of affection with my secret boyfriend. It was 10 years ago and my family didn\u2019t yet know I was gay. Both my parents are vicars and my sister had just come out, and it wasn\u2019t a good environment. Only the police showed any support. I had anxiety around public affection after that. I\u2019d have panic attacks on dates. So it was therapeutic for me to be publicly proposing with so much support. Saying that, as we got near the spot outside Hamleys on Regent Street where I knew Johnny would be, my nerves were something else. My body rushed with adrenaline. He saw me and waved excitedly; it\u2019s impossible not to be excited at Pride. An inspector stopped the parade. It was all done very precisely, very police-like. I walked towards Johnny. He had no idea. I couldn\u2019t see anything but him. I couldn\u2019t hear the crowd. I took my helmet off, so I\u2019d be able to see him when I was kneeling. I was trying not to rush it. The sergeant helping me beforehand had said, \u201cGo ahead. You\u2019ll be nervous, but don\u2019t rush it.\u201d I took Johnny\u2019s hand and got down on one knee. Then it clicked with him and it began to click with the crowd. I said: \u201cJonathan Sammons, will you marry me?\u201d He paused, then said, \u201cYes.\u201d The crowd exploded. There was cheering and people started chanting, \u201cLove is love\u201d. I was aware I was still on duty, so there were limitations to what I could do. I was thinking, \u201cShould I kiss him?\u201d He\u2019d just agreed to marry me, which was a huge deal, so I just reacted and we kissed. Johnny\u2019s been instrumental in getting me comfortable with showing affection. My friends say, \u201cWhat\u2019s he done to you? You\u2019re holding hands in public. This isn\u2019t the Phil we know.\u201d Back at the police station, I was waiting to go off duty when the inspector told me the proposal was online and had already got hundreds of thousands of views. I had been told there wouldn\u2019t be any press, but there was a TV crew, photographers and of course lots of people caught it on their phones. On the tube home, we heard people talking about it. A friend working with the Royal Ballet in Tokyo sent me a text saying we were on Japanese news. The UK papers went crazy. It was overwhelming. We can get a distorted view of life with all the horrible and tragic news stories. The reality is good things like this happen all the time. The backdrop of Brexit had some people worried that the UK was becoming less tolerant of our differences. But the positive reaction to the proposal shows the country is accepting and actually a really wonderful place, and we do celebrate diversity. We\u2019re getting married next year. It feels like a different life from where I was 10 years ago. \u2022 Are you in a notable photograph? Email thatsme@theguardian.com"

"23||The Witches: Salem, 1692, A History review \u2013 what drove the puritans to such hysteria?Translucent cats, balls of fire, yellow birds, spectral women perched on roof beams: Salem\u2019s puritans lived in a dull, damp, muddy-hemmed world, but as Stacy Schiff\u2019s account of the most infamous of all witch trials shows, the creatures they imagined in the heat of the hysteria that gripped them during 1692 offered lurid compensation. Fourteen women and five men were executed for witchcraft during that terrible Massachusetts year, just a fraction of those accused of pinching and poking a chorus of convulsing \u201cvisionary\u201d adolescent girls, or of suckling demons, or appearing by the beds of God-fearing men and women. Burrowing deep into her sources, Schiff enters the world of accusers and accused, finding the humanity and horror in the grim gothic landscape of meeting house, parsonage and gallows. Her psychological insights are compelling, exploring how the fearful repressions of a Puritan childhood and the pressures of small-town isolation could have led to such extreme events. She is firstly a masterful storyteller, though, bringing these characters, her own cast of witch\u2019s poppets out of their 17th-century gloom and into chattering, shaking, finger-pointing life. \u2022 The Witches is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.

"4||Rochdale\u2019s Calvin Andrew handed 12-match ban for violent conductThe Rochdale striker Calvin Andrew has been banned for 12 matches after an incident against Oldham \u2013 one of the longest suspensions in Football League history. The Football Association said the former Luton, Crystal Palace and Port Vale player \u201cwas involved in an act of violent conduct in or around the 77th minute of the game\u201d, which Rochdale won 1-0. It is believed the incident concerned the Oldham defender Peter Clarke, who was struck by an elbow near the edge of his six-yard box as a Rochdale attack broke down close to the corner flag. The FA\u2019s statement said the incident was not seen by the match officials but caught on video: \u201cIt was alleged the standard punishment of three matches that would otherwise apply would be clearly insufficient. The player admitted his behaviour constituted violent conduct but denied the clearly insufficient element of the charge. However, this was found proven following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing.\u201d Andrew, who signed a new one-year contract in the summer having moved to Rochdale in 2014, will not play again this year. Only Eric Cantona has been given a more hefty sentence after the Manchester United forward was banned for nine months in 1995 for striking a Crystal Palace supporter. Joey Barton was also banned for 12 matches in 2012 for two charges of violent conduct in QPR\u2019s 3-2 defeat at Manchester City."
"17||M&S expected to announce closure of up to 30 storesMarks &amp; Spencer is expected to announce the closure of up to 30 stores next week as part of an attempt to revive the British retailer. Smaller outlets in flagging towns and shopping centres are likely to form the bulk of the closures, and other stores could be relocated or downsized over several years, potentially leading to thousands of job losses. Shopfloor space is expected to be reallocated, as the Guardian first reported earlier this year, meaning bigger food halls and smaller clothing areas. Unwanted floorspace could be given over to other businesses including retailers and restaurants. Sources told Sky News, which first reported the closures, that they would number \u201cin the low dozens\u201d. Like others on the high street, M&amp;S is struggling to adapt to changing shopping habits. As more people make purchases online, smaller or less attractive town centres and shopping centres are losing out. Clothing retailers have had a difficult year of unseasonal weather, while shoppers have been spending more on eating out, holidays and technology, and less on fashion. The M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe, is expected to announce the store cuts as part of a wide strategic rethink. He is also expected to close stores in China, where M&amp;S has found trading tough, and signal further shutdowns in continental Europe. Rowe is expected to focus instead on expanding M&amp;S\u2019s successful food business, which plans to add 200 small shops by 2019. The latest move comes after M&amp;S announced plans to cut 525 London head office jobs as part of Rowe\u2019s attempts to reduce costs and simplify the business. He is attempting to turn around M&amp;S after the biggest fall in its clothing sales since the 2008 financial crisis. Last year M&amp;S closed a net five \u201cdiscount\u201d stores and one high street outlet in the UK, but increased total trading space slightly by opening dozens of franchised Simply Food stores. The group closed 13 stores in Europe last year. M&amp;S has about 300 full-range stores, 640 food-only outlets, 131 of which are larger food halls, and more than 400 stores overseas. Tony Shiret, an analyst at Haitong, said M&amp;S probably needed to close more than 30 stores, given the changing nature of shopping and years of poor performance by the retailer\u2019s clothing ranges. \u201cThere are a lot of traditional high street shops that have not had a lot of money spent on them for a long time,\u201d he said, suggesting that M&amp;S should shut 20% of its space, as many as 60 stores. But he added: \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to close that amount of space and when you do, it puts pressures on your supply chain.\u201d"
"3||Thorbjorn Olesen capitalises on high-profile absentees to lead way in TurkeyOut of non-appearance comes opportunity and scope for a fairytale. It was lost in the buildup to the Turkish Airlines Open that Rory McIlroy, Patrick Reed, Martin Kaymer and others\u2019 refusal to participate opened the door for less decorated professionals to earn a life-changing sum. First prize here is \u00a3950,000. The average world ranking of the top seven players on the leaderboard after 36 holes is 189. Thongchai Jaidee, who is 51st, is the standout thoroughbred. Yet it is another player, Thorbjorn Olesen, who is seeking to canter towards a fourth win on the European Tour and his first since the Dunhill Links Championship of 2015. Halfway through this event, Olesen leads by six strokes. A closing six holes on Friday played in the same number under par contributed to a stunning 62, nine under, for the Dane. Olesen even had the temerity to make a bogey at the 11th before his rocket-fuelled run for home. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been up in contention in a lot of big events, so I feel pretty comfortable,\u201d the 26-year-old said. \u201cThere are still 36 holes to go, so that\u2019s a lot of golf to be played, but I have to keep being aggressive out there, keep going after some of the pins to try to make birdies. That\u2019s the only way I can win. \u201cI think I found something in Portugal a few weeks ago. I didn\u2019t score that well there but I felt like I was playing a lot better so I was hoping for something good to come. Yesterday was a great putting display, and today I played better and still putted great, so it\u2019s been a really good couple days.\u201d Olesen\u2019s promise has never been in doubt, even if he has not fully capitalised on it, though injury has played a part. He was taken to the Ryder Cup by Europe\u2019s captain, Darren Clarke, with the aim of offering inspiration. Time is still on the side of the man from Copenhagen, who was sixth in the 2013 Masters. Olesen has an aggregate of 15 under par. His closest challengers are Jaidee and Adrian Otaegui, the latter a Spaniard who easily retained his European Tour card for this season with winnings of just under \u20ac400,000. Perhaps that freedom contributed to a second round of 63. The Italian Matteo Manassero, who has slipped to No356 in the world, is at eight under par and in a tie for third. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a long process,\u201d the 23-year-old said. \u201cI would say at the beginning of this year, I had a really deep thought with myself. I just answered a few questions I needed to in order to keep going. I basically made a clean sheet and started again from March onwards. It\u2019s been a good development since and I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m standing now. \u201cThe best lesson is that you teach yourself many more things than what everybody else can teach you. You go through low moments and everybody is going to go through them; I didn\u2019t know that before 2014 and 2015. \u201cObviously Thorbjorn is playing great golf here but there is still a long way to go and I\u2019m thinking about myself, my game, nothing else. That is in pretty good shape, so that\u2019s the positive I can take.\u201d Danny Willett\u2019s renewed confidence after an opening round of 69 did not last long. The Masters champion slipped to a 74 in the second round, having failed to record a birdie and later tweeted, \u201cThis game is really kicking me in the nuts at the minute\u201d. Andy Sullivan added a 67 to his first-round 71, while Padraig Harrington made up for Thursday\u2019s 72 by faring three shots better. Ewan Murray travelled courtesy of Turkish Airlines"

"4||Hep-cat daddio barometer of modern football cultureYAYA BLINKS Stop it there. Enough already. You can consign today\u2019s Fiver to the dustbin of internet history (unless of course you\u2019re one of those people lucky enough to have an email service that does it automatically) and head straight to the drinker, because nothing in today\u2019s edition of the world\u2019s only tea-timely email is going to top that headline. Wordplay so cunning you could, in the words of Blackadder, pin a tail on it and call it a weasel, not only does it dredge up memories of a Star Wars character most right-thinking nerds would rather forget, it more or less tells the whole story of how, with monotonous predictability, Yaya Tour\u00e9 was first to crack in his unwinnable stand-off with Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola. If at least three different tabloids don\u2019t nick it for Saturday\u2019s back pages, then The Fiver will finally be prepared to concede that we\u2019re not quite the hep-cat daddio barometer of modern football culture we\u2019ve long presumed ourselves to be. The story so far: after Yaya was left out of City\u2019s squad for Big Cup, the Ivorian\u2019s reclusive, softly-spoken Mr 15%, Dimitri Seluk, sent his rattle sailing out of the pram in a parabolic arc, accusing Pep of \u201chumiliating\u201d his client. \u201cThis is Pep\u2019s decision and we must respect it,\u201d he said, before embarking on a series of disrespectful and very public tirades traducing the Spaniard\u2019s capabilities as a man and manager. Pep duly responded by announcing that Yaya would not be considered for the City first team until Seluk expressed contrition for his remarks and has remained steadfastly true to his word in the two months since. Having maintained a dignified silen \u2026 well, a silence, Yaya has finally cracked and on Friday issued an apology to his gaffer, that could scarcely have sounded more sincere if it had come from The Fiver after inadvertently spilling the pint of our violent Scottish cousin Begbie McFiver in an Edinburgh boozer. \u201cI wish to apologise \u2013 on behalf of myself and those who represent me \u2013 to the management team and all those working at the club for the misunderstandings from the past,\u201d simpered Yaya. \u201cThose statements do not represent my views on the club or the people who work there. I have nothing but respect for Manchester City and only wish the best for the football club. I am immensely proud to have played a part in the club\u2019s history and want to help City succeed further. I live to play football and entertain the fans.\u201d So that\u2019s that, then. Although Seluk has technically not apologised, Yaya has apologised on his behalf and with Pep being a reasonable man of his word, will now be free to play football and entertain the fans. Well, he might have been until \u2026 well, over to you Mr Seluk. \u201cWe want peace, but I\u2019m not apologising,\u201d he thundered through our radio speakers. \u201cApologise for what? Maybe Tour\u00e9 has apologised for this, but I don\u2019t know for what. I think Yaya don\u2019t mean this.\u201d A Seluk in full-on sulk mode? To paraphrase Elton John, sometimes sorry, even if said insincerely for the sake of an easy life, seems to be the hardest word.

"17||Housing associations added to Bank's bond-buying schemeThe Bank of England has added housing associations to its \u00a310bn corporate bond-buying scheme for the first time, which could give a boost to housebuilding by reducing the cost of borrowing. The move comes after lobbying from the National Housing Federation and and other groups such as Positive Money, and Theresa May\u2019s criticism of the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme and its \u201cbad side-effects\u201d for poorer people. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, had said companies will have to show they make a \u201cmaterial contribution to the UK economy\u201d to qualify for the corporate bond programme. There was some surprise, however, when the list of bonds included foreign-owned corporations with limited UK operations, such as Apple, rather than businesses that bolster the UK\u2019s infrastructure. Buying the bonds of housing associations could make borrowing cheaper, reducing interest payments and increasing the amount of money available to invest in housing. However, housing experts questioned whether investors such as pension funds would want to buy those bonds, as other bonds currently offer better returns. Peabody, one of the UK\u2019s oldest housing associations, said it was delighted by the Bank\u2019s move, and that as a result its cost of borrowing had fallen by eight basis points. Peabody owns assets worth \u00a33bn and plans to build 8,000 homes. It is leading a \u00a31.5bn regeneration project in Thamesmead, south-east London, which is expected to deliver up to 20,000 homes. It includes the revamp of a 1970s housing estate that served as the backdrop to A Clockwork Orange. Susan Hickey, Peabody\u2019s chief finance officer, said: \u201cThis is a historic achievement for the sector, demonstrating real confidence in our ability, in our financial strength and capacity to help tackle the housing crisis. This should make it cheaper to borrow and make it easier for us to invest and attract investment in new homes, communities and infrastructure. It is great news.\u201d The editor of Social Housing magazine, Luke Cross, said: \u201cThis obviously could accelerate housing and regeneration schemes, like Peabody\u2019s in Thamesmead.\u201d But he added a note of caution: \u201cOne question is whether investors like pension funds will want to sell these bonds. They still need to find somewhere safe to invest people\u2019s pensions, and many of the bonds they have at the moment offer better returns than they could get in the market today.\u201d The amount of bonds bought by the Bank of England will depend on the size of housing associations\u2019 issuance. Property and finance made up 2% of the Bank\u2019s corporate bond purchase programme in September."

"22||Scottish ministers ban police from searching children for alcoholScottish ministers have banned police from stopping and searching children for alcohol without legal cause after they found little evidence to support its use. To the irritation of some rank and file officers, Michael Matheson, the Scottish justice secretary, said the government would instead focus on introducing a new statutory code of practice to cover searches of adults next year. \u201cWe know stop and search can be a valuable tool on combating crime, but it is important that we get the balance right between protecting the public and the rights of individuals,\u201d Matheson said. Scottish police will still have the legal power to require an underage child to hand over alcohol if they can see it on them but, after this new bar on non-statutory searches, would need to arrest them if they refuse to hand it over. The decision follows lengthy reviews into the once heavy use of non-statutory stop and searches in Scotland including children younger than 10, which became particularly widespread in Strathclyde under the then chief constable Sir Stephen House. Unlike in England and Wales, where the practice is heavily regulated, Scottish police were repeatedly using common law powers for \u201cconsensual\u201d searches of children without oversight and legal cause. At its peak, Scotland\u2019s overall stop and search rate was four times higher than in England and Wales. A study by academic researcher Kath Murray, with the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research, found under-14s were searched 26,000 times in 2010 without the specific statutory power to do so. That included 500 searches of children under-10s. In Strathclyde, there were more recorded searches of 16-year-olds than the number of people that age living in the force area, at a rate of 1,406 searches per 1,000 people. The police and the then justice secretary, Kenny MacAskill, insisted that non-statutory stop and searches were an essential weapon in the wider strategy of combating underage drinking and antisocial behaviour. Few children objected and many adults supported it, they said. In 2015, the UN human rights committee said the practice was \u201callegedly unlawful and disproportionate\u201d and should be scrapped. But an expert panel set up by Scottish ministers to review all stop and search policies could not agree on whether to do so or not, leading to the latest review. However, the Scottish government\u2019s review, published on Friday, found that after stricter oversight was introduced in the summer of 2015, there were still few successful discoveries of alcohol on children. Of 1,629 consensual searches of children, only 158 \u2013 or less than one search in 10 \u2013 found alcohol. For searches involving adults aged 18 or over, the figure reached 16.3%. There were far more cases \u2013 2,551 in total \u2013 where children voluntarily handed over alcohol without being searched. Matheson said the question of non-statutory search powers of children would be revisited 12 months after a new code of conduct comes into force next year, to see if there was clear evidence the power was needed. Murray said this was a measured and welcome decision by ministers. \u201cAny increase in the powers of the police should be evidence based, and as the Scottish government and Police Scotland have acknowledged, there is currently insufficient evidence to support such a move.\u201d The Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, would not comment directly on the government\u2019s decision. Calum Steele, its general secretary, tweeted:"
"6||As Nicaragua's first couple consolidates power, a daughter fears for her countryMost daughters would be proud of a mother on the verge of a historic election victory, but the prospect brings pain and dread to Zoilam\u00e9rica Narv\u00e1ez Murillo, who says she fears the politics of her nation are becoming as destructively incestuous as that of her family. Narv\u00e1ez is the outcast child of Nicaragua\u2019s first lady, Rosario Murillo, who is standing for the first time in this Sunday\u2019s election on the same ticket as her husband, the veteran Sandinista leader and national president Daniel Ortega. Polls suggest the first couple will win by a landslide, prompting comparisons with the Underwoods in the TV drama House of Cards, outrage among an opposition who claim a rigged poll is cementing the power of an authoritarian dynasty, and despondency in their daughter. Narv\u00e1ez claims Ortega, her stepfather, sexually abused her from the age of nine years old. When she went public with these accusations in 1998, her mother turned against her and led a campaign of denials that propelled the president\u2019s wife into a more powerful position both in her marital relationship and national government. In the years since, Murillo has moved from the fringes to the centre of Nicaraguan politics. She is already de facto chief of staff, the main spokesman of the administration and a micromanager whose approval is needed for every ministerial interview or policy draft. The vice-presidency will formalise her power. According to Narv\u00e1ez, it will also complete a cynical trade-off. \u201cI feel like I was sold, that I was part of a transaction. Since I came out and revealed what happened, she has tried to eliminate the truth. It\u2019s part of an agreement she has with Daniel. She told him, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll deal with it\u2019,\u201d Narv\u00e1ez told the Guardian. \u201cShe denied the sexual abuse of her daughter to prove her loyalty and maintain power. It was politics that motivated her.\u201d Ortega and Murillo did not respond to requests for an interview, but they have previously denied Narv\u00e1ez\u2019s accusations and argued that political opponents are trying to use them to undermine a popular government. They are by no means the only allegations against the first couple, who have also alienated many former associates with their increasingly authoritarian leadership. Ortega is accused of using his influence over the courts and the electoral council to overcome constitutional term limits for himself and to block the opposition alliance that came second in the last election \u2013 headed by the Independent Liberal party \u2013 from fielding their chosen candidates. Despite concerns about previous elections in 2008 and 2011, the president has ignored reform recommendations by monitors from the European Union and Organisation of American States (OAS). \u201cThis is the moment of total collapse for the Nicaraguan democratic system. In the past 40 years, we have not seen an election that is less credible or more fraudulent,\u201d said Dora Mar\u00eda T\u00e9llez, founder of the breakaway Sandinista Renovation Movement, which was earlier stripped of its legal status. \u201cOrtega controls the entire process \u2013 who can contest, who monitors the vote and how the count is organised.\u201d Like Ortega, T\u00e9llez risked her life for the Sandinista revolution. In 1978, she was among the leaders of a daring mission that seized the national assembly and took 1,500 people hostage, including most of the congressmen. This was a turning point in the struggle against the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle and she hoped it would usher in a period of greater freedoms and social justice. But under Ortega, she says the country appears to be going backwards to an old system of a family dictatorship. T\u00e9llez said that as well as nominating his wife as vice-president, Ortega has ensured the first couple\u2019s children have dominant positions in the tourist industry, the media, and business with China (including over the currently stalled plans for a canal), while their in-laws run the police and oil distribution networks. \u201cThe family of Ortega and Murillo have taken over the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) like a parasite, using their control to benefit their family. It is basically the same as what the Somozas did,\u201d she told the Guardian, as a tropical rainstorm lashed the streets of Managua, the country\u2019s capital. \u201cHe\u2019s a representative of big capital. He and his family are now among the richest in Nicaragua. This is a profoundly corrupt system that completely betrays the principles of the Sandinista movement.\u201d But many voters remain loyal to the FSLN, which introduced free healthcare and education and more recent benefits \u2013 such as free Wi-Fi in city parks \u2013 that other governments failed to deliver to one of the poorest countries in Latin America. With decades of experience, the first couple have also proved among the wiliest political operators in the region, building alliances with key sectors of society, pursuing business-friendly policies, and ruthlessly applying a strategy of divide and rule for their enemies, all the while ensuring an ever tighter grip on all branches of government and the election process. The powerful Catholic and evangelical lobbies are happy the government has committed itself to strict anti-abortion laws, devoted public funds to church renovation, and that the first couple are running under a slogan of \u201cChristian, socialist, solidarity\u201d \u2013 which can be seen on pink and purple roadside banners across the capital. Corporations like the government\u2019s orthodox macroeconomic policy, relatively low crime rates compared with most other central American neighbours, and a GDP growth rate that has been ticking along at about 4.5% for the past two years, despite the sharp decline in financial support from Venezuela and a fall in commodity prices. The result is some way from socialism or democracy, but it has proved resilient. While other leftist governments in Latin America have been pushed from power, lost key elections or come under pressure in the past year, Ortega and Murillo remain far ahead in the polls. With the opposition denied or divided, there is no real contest so the strongest vote against the government is likely to come from the campaign for abstentions and deliberately spoiled ballots. It will be hard to know how effective this proves, however, because the result will be easy to manipulate without independent monitors. Concerns about the vote may lead to repercussions. The OAS has said it will issue a report on the electoral system six months from now. The United States Senate is also debating a bill \u2013 the Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act (more widely known simply as NICA) \u2013 that would impose financial controls on the country if it restricts multi-party democracy. But any punishment would come too late to affect the outcome, which means Ortega is almost certain to secure his third consecutive term, with Murillo becoming his vice-president. How much further she can go is now the subject of speculation, fired by unsubstantiated rumours her husband is unwell. Some gossip that the old guard of the Sandinistas are manoeuvring to block her from taking over if Ortega died. Others believe Murillo \u2013 a poet \u2013 is already in the driving seat, due to her increasingly prominent role. It is her voice that updates the nation with a radio broadcast each lunchtime. It is her artistic tastes that have resulted in Managua\u2019s roadsides being adorned with numerous luridly coloured steel \u201ctrees of life\u201d. \u201cI think she is more powerful than him,\u201d said Maria Fernanda Flores, a Liberal opposition congressional candidate and wife of the former president Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n. \u201cShe\u2019s the only one who talks. You don\u2019t hear other ministers. You almost never hear Daniel. You forget what his voice is like.\u201d Narv\u00e1ez, however, remembers. She said she was driven to exile in Costa Rica by the harassment she faced after her accusations, and that she cannot forget the violence in her family and the lies that followed so they could maintain power. She warned the country could be in for something similar. \u201cThe abuser of a child captures, isolates and brainwashes their victim. That is what is happening to Nicaragua, which has a political system controlled by one family that denies opposition,\u201d she said. This article was corrected on 5 November 2016. The Sandinista National Liberation Front is referred to as the FSLN, not the FLSN."
"17||Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin: \u2018The EU became a quasi-religion, and universities are the modern-day seminaries\u2019Every time I interview a Brexiteer, I come away more confused than I arrived. This week I thought I was going to meet the pub trade\u2019s real life Al Murray, for the parallels between Tim Martin\u2019s public image and the fictional Eurosceptic landlord appear disconcertingly close. In fact, on the train to JD Wetherspoon HQ in Watford I opened the Guardian to find a quiz inviting readers to guess which quotes to attribute to each publican. When I run the quiz past Martin later, even he gets two answers wrong. The founder of Wetherspoon\u2019s first entered the debate about Europe in 2002, when he distributed 500,000 beer mats across his pub chain, urging Britain not to join the euro. Before this year\u2019s referendum he printed up another half a million mats, encouraging his customers to back Brexit. One of Vote Leave\u2019s few high-profile businessmen, the multi-millionaire was back in the headlines this week, attacking EU leaders for \u201chectoring\u201d the UK. If Jean-Claude Juncker doesn\u2019t stop \u201cbullying\u201d us, he warned, Wetherspoon pubs might stop stocking European wines and lagers and buy its drinks elsewhere. \u201cBritons could BOYCOTT European booze if Juncker punishes UK, warns Wetherspoons boss,\u201d whooped a Daily Express headline. But Martin\u2019s vision of Brexit turns out to be very different to that of others on his side. During the referendum campaign, a diversity of reasons for leaving was one of the leave side\u2019s great strengths; amid the chorus of different arguments there was something for almost everyone. Now that they have won, however, their incompatibility is becoming overwhelmingly clear. In many respects, Martin\u2019s view of Europe is as unlike Nigel Farage\u2019s \u2013 or Al Murray\u2019s \u2013 as mine. We meet in his office, an unostentatious room cluttered with boxes of Mo\u00ebt champagne, which he gives to office staff when it\u2019s their birthday. At 6ft 6in, well built and ruddy-faced, he looks more like a farmer than a multi-millionaire chairman, and now that he has tamed his silver mullet into a more conventional haircut, the most striking thing about him is his voice. Martin grew up in Northern Ireland and New Zealand, and the accent meanders between the two, via the West Country, interrupted by endless eruptions of booming laughter. I can\u2019t remember meeting anyone who laughs so much, so I ask if he is enjoying his role as a political campaigner. \u201cWell, it\u2019s quite weird, actually,\u201d he admits, \u201cbecause it was unplanned.\u201d In 2002, in the wake of the ERM debacle and with the prospect of Britain joining the euro, Martin made the \u201cbanal observation\u201d that \u201cevery other currency in the world has got a government. The euro can\u2019t work without a government. I kept waiting for a Harvard professor to come out of the woodwork and say, \u2018I\u2019ve never heard such ignorance in my life.\u2019 But they never did. So I just kept repeating it. I became someone on the national news, repeating the same phrase.\u201d He breaks into a cackle. \u201cAnd in the end, the point was true.\u201d Once Britain opted not to join the euro, Martin lost interest in Europe. \u201cI never said a word.\u201d Had we met even just a couple of years ago, would he even have described himself as fiercely Eurosceptic? \u201cNot in the way that a lot of fiercely Eurosceptic people were. I think I was probably just starting to become aware of the lack of democracy at the heart of the EU, and formed the amateur philosophical theory that for the future of humanity \u2013 for prosperity and peace \u2013 you must have democracy. Because if you don\u2019t have democracy,\u201d and he starts to laugh again, \u201cyou always end up with a nutter in charge.\u201d (Does the same apply to businesses? \u201cYes! Even more so, only the customers are the electorate.\u201d) Martin wouldn\u2019t even have been too unhappy for us to remain in the EU. \u201cI just agreed with David Cameron that it needed fundamental reform.\u201d The 61-year-old is of the firm, if increasingly heretical, opinion that Britain has benefited enormously from EU migration, \u201cnot just economically but socially and culturally\u201d. His preferred Brexit model would continue to allow anyone from current EU member states to live and work here. \u201cIf you look around the world, successful economies and countries have had gradually rising populations, and that\u2019s needed for the UK as well.\u201d The only change he would make to the free movement of labour would be to exclude countries who join the EU in the future. How, then, did he feel when the leave campaign focused so heavily on immigration? He exhales uneasily, ums and ahs, and says: \u201cWell, you\u2019ll always get an element of xenophobia in any society, but I don\u2019t think Britain is generally xenophobic. There was one poster I didn\u2019t think should have been put there. But for me, I argued from the point of democracy.\u201d Martin doesn\u2019t even share most Brexiteers\u2019 fury at the high court ruling requiring parliament\u2019s consent to trigger article 50. \u201cWell, it creates a bit more uncertainty,\u201d he offers, \u201cso I can\u2019t exactly welcome it. But I\u2019ll support the legal outcome, because I believe in the law, and I believe in parliament, and I believe in democracy.\u201d The democratic deficit is Martin\u2019s sole objection to the EU project. \u201cThe thing I cannot understand is that when I said I think democracy is crucial for the future of the world, I\u2019d have thought people would pour out of the doors saying, \u2018Yes! Tim is right!\u2019 But people on the remain side just don\u2019t seem to think like that. The emotion of people who\u2019ve been to good universities, et cetera, is not that they owe everything to democracy, but that they owe everything to people like them, who are better able to run companies, the civil service, universities, societies in general.\u201d The phrase \u201cbetter able to run companies\u201d catches my attention. Martin studied law at university, and qualified as a barrister, but then at 24 bought a pub in north London. There was more than a touch of the maverick, plucky little guy about his business model as he expanded: when brewers refused to sell him their tied-lease pubs, he bought up old banks and shops, licensed the converted premises and set about selling affordable food and drink to the unfashionable masses. Famously scruffy, he drives an old Volvo \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t own a yacht\u201d \u2013 and is pointedly unimpressed by the pretensions of professional boardroom culture. It makes me wonder if his Euroscepticism is really another expression of his emotional rebellion against the blue-chip elite. \u201cNo. I know what you\u2019re driving at, but no.\u201d It\u2019s the remainers, he claims, who are motivated by emotion. \u201cSomeone from the Financial Times said I was a great amateur philosopher, which is an insult \u2013 and also probably true.\u201d He hoots with laughter. \u201cAnd I think modern people think because they don\u2019t go to church they\u2019re more sophisticated and don\u2019t have a religion. But I think what the EU became was a quasi-religion for that sector of society. And universities are the modern day seminaries.\u201d Although happy to be a philosopher, he is emphatically not a politician. The last time he voted in a general election was 1992; \u201cI\u2019m not proud of that fact. I just didn\u2019t feel strongly enough.\u201d The only other time he has ever voted was in the 80s, for Margaret Thatcher, because she was his local MP. He mispronounces Andrea Leadsom and Gisela Stuart\u2019s names, and until recently Nigel Farage was the only Ukip politician he had even heard of. Were he American, he would vote for Hillary Clinton, and thinks Donald Trump is a \u201ccomplete egocentric weirdo\u201d, but adds that \u201cI trust the American people to look into it in a bit more detail than me,\u201d so will defer to their judgment next week. \u201cI would never want to be a politician. I know my limitations, and I\u2019m sure politics is more difficult than it looks.\u201d Martin\u2019s indignation this week about EU leaders\u2019 hostility towards Britain did seem politically naive. How else did he imagine they would feel about us for leaving? \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really know. It was impossible to know how they would react.\u201d He was very cross with Juncker for telling EU business leaders to be \u201cintransigent\u201d in their dealings with British companies. \u201cAnd after telling them to make sure the UK pays a price, he has to expect people from the UK who are fighting from the opposite economic position to make the opposite case!\u201d Well, yes, quite. This outbreak of hostilities was precisely what the remainers had warned of. But leavers will be disappointed by his response when I ask about his boycott. \u201cOh dear!\u201d he laughs, burying his head in his hands. \u201cI can see I\u2019m in trouble here already! I haven\u2019t got a boycott. Absolutely not. I was just attempting to show that if European companies do what Juncker says and try to get heavy with us, inevitably we\u2019d go elsewhere.\u201d I don\u2019t know what \u201cget heavy\u201d means. \u201cWell, no one does!\u201d he hoots. Martin has said the UK doesn\u2019t need to sign a trade deal with the EU, because his pubs don\u2019t sign deals with suppliers. He can\u2019t think running the country is like running a pub, can he? \u201cWhat I was saying is that you can\u2019t go into negotiations with the EU insisting upon a particular outcome. If you say your pre-condition is that we have to have free trade, then in order to get that you have to accept what comes with that.\u201d I suggest that I\u2019ll be the EU, and he can be the UK, and he can show me how he would approach the negotiations. \u201cOK, I would say: Decca, I think free trade will suit both our territories better.\u201d I\u2019ll say: fine, but in that case you have to accept free movement of labour. \u201cI\u2019ll say: look, politically, we can\u2019t.\u201d But this is non-negotiable, I\u2019ll say. \u201cThen I think that we have to, er \u2013 well, it\u2019s up to you then, Decca, what you want to do. We\u2019d like to trade with you. You want to trade with us. So what basis would you like to trade on? That\u2019s what I would say.\u201d I\u2019m not sure this would resolve the impasse. Martin is banking on the EU\u2019s aversion to tariffs to overcome its impulse to impose terms that deter other members from leaving \u2013 and he may be right. But this is a businessman\u2019s assumption; to EU leaders, their political project\u2019s survival may turn out to matter more. We move on to much firmer ground when we abandon Europe and talk about the pub trade. To its admirers, Wetherspoon\u2019s is the saviour of the industry \u2013 while nearly 30 pubs go out of business every week, Martin\u2019s chain keeps on growing. With nearly 1,000 pubs, it turns over \u00a31.5bn a year, employs 35,000 staff, and makes Martin, who owns between a quarter and a third of its shares, worth roughly \u00a3250m. But a sign on his office wall reads \u201cOnly the paranoid survive\u201d \u2013 \u201cand I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in that\u201d, he says. Critics accuse the chain of corporate blandness, and he concedes that \u201cthere are instances where the design hasn\u2019t been good enough, and it has given too much of an impression of impersonality or airport lounge. Pubs need individuality.\u201d He spends three days a week visiting his pubs all over the country, and constantly worries about their future. \u201cYou lose a lot without pubs. They\u2019re an important part of the social and cultural life of the country.\u201d But whereas pubs must charge 20% VAT, supermarkets pay \u201cvirtually no VAT on food sales\u201d, allowing them to subsidise drinks prices. \u201cBut most of the big companies say nothing about it. Because the people running them are taking too short-term an approach; they\u2019re there for five years, they\u2019re not looking 10 or 20 years down the line,\u201d Martin says. He worries about millennials binge-drinking cheap supermarket spirits at home, instead of learning \u201csocial drinking\u201d in pubs, which have \u201cmore or less become ghettos now for adults. Some sort of system that allowed 16-year-olds to have a beer or two in a pub would be good.\u201d Martin might not share all of Al Murray\u2019s views about Europe, but he is a big fan. He\u2019s sure it was Murray who assured an anxious post-referendum public: \u201cCrisps will remain at the current price,\u201d and named as his most extravagant possession: \u201cMy wife, and even she\u2019s a bit mean.\u201d In both instances, it was actually him \u2013 which, of course, only makes him laugh again. \u201cShould have got the crisps right.\u201d"
"17||Will the US election mean the end of free trade?There is a tendency to overendow political events with economic significance. However, the 2016 US presidential election could deliver a tectonic shift in international economic relations. For the most part, the candidates\u2019 platforms are standard, partisan fare. Hillary Clinton argues for investment in education and infrastructure, and a higher minimum wage. Donald Trump, too, advocates infrastructure spending along with tax cuts and the repeal of Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law. However, one issue simultaneously distinguishes the main contenders from previous nominees while separating one from the other. Since at least 1945, it has been a near article of faith in the west that free trade is an engine of growth. No candidate for either main US party has sought to roll back trade liberalisation. Until now. Previously in favour of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a draft of which she once described as \u201cthe gold standard in trade agreements\u201d, Hillary Clinton now opposes it. Her reason is that it provides insufficient protection to American workers whose jobs and living standards it might harm. Donald Trump is more strident still, and quite distinctly different from any candidate since 1928. Then, Herbert Hoover won the White House promising farmers that he would raise agricultural tariffs to protect them. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased levies on a range of goods, not just farm products. The consequent retaliation of other nations intensified the Depression-era slump in world trade. On his visits to Pittsburgh, once the crucible of US steel production, Trump told audiences that the industry\u2019s demise was down to bad trade deals negotiated by incompetent bureaucrats. He promised to conclude good, tough deals and bring back steel. While the likely content of a Trump trade policy is unclear, he has threatened tariffs of 45% on China and 35% on Mexico. He says withdrawing the US from the World Trade Organisation is an option and that he will break or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The dogs on the street seem to know that Clinton\u2019s position is an electoral convenience. Pushed by Bernie Sanders, she threw TPP overboard in the primaries but will throw it a lifebelt in office, the argument runs. Rhetorically at least, Trump seems set on holing the world trading system below the waterline. If he expects other countries meekly to accept tariff hikes, he will be sorely disappointed. This antipathy to free trade baffles conventionally schooled policymakers who believe, correctly, that it makes us better off on average. While most people win, however, some lose and lose badly. Economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson have shown that in parts of the US exposed to competition from China, unemployment has risen, pay has fallen and the number claiming benefits has increased. The winners\u2019 gains are spread thinly and widely. The losers\u2019 losses tend to be deep and are often concentrated in specific areas, around cities such as Pittsburgh. Although the winners could compensate the losers leaving everyone better off, neither in the US nor elsewhere have we found a way to do that. Trade adjustment assistance \u2013 payments to US workers affected by import competition \u2013 has not offset the effects of job losses. Electoral college maths makes states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania crucial to the outcome of the race. They more than most have lost jobs to import competition. In this context, railing against trade makes sense. Continuing that in office would leave the US, and others, worse off. Even if Clinton wins and, once in office, tacks towards a freer trade position, this issue will not go away. More Americans believe trade lowers wages and costs jobs than the opposite. This is not just an American phenomenon. In Germany, fewer than two-fifths of people support an EU-US free trade agreement. Among the explanations for the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU is that the places that voted most for Brexit were those that had lost most in trade with China. Free trade has been a source of economic progress. But winning that case in the public square will no longer be achieved though facts, figures and smart debating points. People need to be convinced, through governments\u2019 actions, that trade agreements will be properly enforced and that when jobs are threatened there is genuine compensation for the losers. Fail to do that and we will undermine one of the most effective means of improving living standards. Stephen Boyle is chief economist at NatWest"

Press Gazette\u2019s editor, Dominic Ponsford, issued a statement on Friday afternoon saying: \u201cA number of the British Journalism Awards judges felt uncomfortable about the fact that Impress were a sponsor of the event. Although the judging process is entirely independent of any sponsorship, they nonetheless felt troubled by their involvement because of their strongly held views on the issue of press regulation. The 49 independent judges are the backbone of the British Journalism Awards and the event cannot happen without their hard work and commitment. We have therefore taken the decision to remove Impress as a sponsor of this year\u2019s awards\u201d. The issue was first raised at a meeting of judges on Thursday. Some judges argued that the choice of Impress, the regulator founded as a rival to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), was inappropriate. They viewed Impress as a state-backed body that presents a threat to press freedom. One of them pointed out that Impress does not regulate any of the newspapers being considered for prizes. Ponsford and his editorial team were not responsible for Impress being selected as a sponsor. It was a commercial matter arranged by the magazine\u2019s publisher, Progressive Media Group. Press Gazette is regulated by Ipso and its editorial line has been less than supportive of Impress. The body is largely funded by charities linked to Max Mosley, the former head of Formula One motor racing, who is regarded as anathema by certain editors and publishers. The awards ceremony is due to be staged on 6 December at the Stationers\u2019 Hall in London."
"17||Investor nerves mount as US election draws closer - as it happenedBefore we close up for the day, here is a summary of some of the main developments. US markets opened slightly lower, but are now up. Following eight straight days of losses, Wall Street appears to have been boosted by the non-farm payrolls report. It was a solid jobs report, with no nasty shocks and an unexpected jump in wages. It does raise the prospect of a rate hike in December, but this was already the expectation. If the S&amp;P 500 were to close down (it is currently up 0.2%), it would mark the longest running streak since 1980. Across the Atlantic, European markets are far more jittery about the prospect of a Trump victory at Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. The FTSE is the biggest faller of the major indices, down 1.4% at 6,692. The pound meanwhile is back above the $1.25 mark for the first time since 6 October. UK new car sales grew modestly in October, by 1.4%. In the eurozone, a series of PMI surveys suggested the single currency bloc got off to a reasonable start in the fourth quarter, mainly thanks to Germany. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all your comments and please join us again on Monday. Have a great weekend. AM. Berenberg\u2019s chart of the week: Mickey Levy, Berenberg\u2019s US chief economist: The 2016 Presidential elections have been a painful story focused on two deeply flawed and damaged candidates. The winner will carry burdens into the White House. The latest polls are pointing to a Hillary Clinton victory and Republicans maintaining control of the House of Representatives. The Senate is a tossup. Congress is crucially important \u2013 plurality in each chamber conveys leadership of every committee \u2013 and will determine policy deliberations as well as many appointments in the new administration . Here in Greece, the EU\u2019s economic tsar Pierre Moscovici has ignited a fierce row with Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister. With a few choice words in his new book, \u201cMidnight in Europe\u201d Moscovici not only accuses the ex finance minister of \u201cunbridled narcissism\u201d but says his negotiating tactics with international creditors at the height of the euro crisis in 2015 did much to exacerbate Greece\u2019s ailing economy. With his frantic pre-occupation with the media and unbridled narcissism, Varoufakis drew the limelight on himself and for several months cannabilised the discussions. He contributed to the tension at the talks by refusing any negotiation. Varoufakis hit back on Friday: The more the third memorandum crumbles, the more determined, it seems, they are to honour me with their hate because I didn\u2019t sign it. I thank them again. Here is our full story on the US jobs report: US markets have opened down, as US election jitters and the prospect of a December rate hike weigh on investors\u2019 minds. Losses are very modest so far. Dow Jones: flat (down 0.1 points) at 17,931 S&amp;P 500: -0.04% at 2,088 Nasdaq: -0.4% at 5,038 Northern Ireland\u2019s bid to become a more attractive place to American firms and tourists was dealt a blow on Friday. United Airlines is pulling the plug on the only direct flight to the US, from from Belfast International Airport to Newark, after the EU blocked regional government state aid to the airline. It was due to receive \u00a39m keep the route going but this was blocked by the European Commission today, and as a result the American carrier will pull its service in January. The airport\u2019s managing dfirector, Graham Keddie, described the EU decision-making process as \u201cabysmal, biased and unfair.\u201d He continued: \u201cThis is a vital link for business and losing it will be a body blow to executive ministers who use it to promote Northern Ireland to would-be investors from the United States.\u201d The Ulster Unionist Party described the loss of the service as an \u201cinternational embarrassment.\u201d Brussels\u2019 decision will be seized upon by the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party as further evidence of European bureaucrats over-riding the democratic wishes of the local power sharing executive and endangering jobs. James Knightley, a senior economist at ING, says a December rate hike is now more likely, but it isn\u2019t a done deal: It seems as though the tightness in the labour market is starting to generate higher pay. The wage story is also good news for consumer spending with average hourly earnings not having risen this fast since mid 2009. So with the economy creating jobs and workers being paid more, it backs the case for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve in December. However, it isn\u2019t a done deal. Any market turmoil relating to next week\u2019s Presidential election would quickly scupper thoughts of a policy change. Capital Economics says the \u201csurge\u201d in US wages signals the Fed will raise rates in December. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist, writes: The solid gain in employment and the acceleration in average hourly earnings growth in October will increase expectations that the Fed will hike interest rates in December (assuming that the election doesn\u2019t throw a spanner in the works.) What will really catch the eye of Fed officials is the 0.4% m/m increase in average hourly earnings last month, which followed an upwardly revised 0.3% m/m gain in September. As a result, the annual growth rate climbed to a seven-year high of 2.8%, from 2.7%. The US unemployment rate fell to 4.9% in October from 5% in September, as expected. The US Labor Department said average hourly earnings grew at an annual rate of 2.8%, the highest in seven years and better than the 2.6% expected. At 161,000, employment growth in October was weaker than the monthly average of 181,000 for 2016. The average monthly increase was 229,000 in 2015. While the October payrolls figure slightly missed expectations, there were no nasty surprises in the report. US futures narrowed losses after the report. US non-farm payrolls increased by 161,000 in October, disappointing expectations of a 175,000 rise. The number for September was revised up sharply to 191,000 from an initial estimate of 156,000. More to follow. The dollar is on track for its worst week in 12 as fears mount that Trump will win the election next week. The US currency has fallen 1.2% this week against a basket of major currencies. Jane Foley, currency strategist at Rabobank: Political uncertainty tends to be currency-negative because the markets find it more difficult to work out how things like trade policy foreign policy are going to play out in the economy. The pound has just hit $1.25 for the first time since early October... But UK markets are leading losses in Europe: FTSE 100: down 1.4% at 6,696 FTSE 250: down 1.9% at 331 Connor Campbell, a financial analyst at Spreadex, says markets are having a \u201cfull on panic attack\u201d over the possibility that Donald Trump will be the next US President. Well what started as a few jitters morphed into a full on panic attack this Friday, the European indices plunging at the prospect of Trump moving into the White House. Looking ahead to this afternoon and, at the moment at least, the Dow Jones futures are suggesting the US index won\u2019t be quite as heavily hit after the bell. And he has this to say on today\u2019s non-farm payrolls report from the US, to be published in a little over half an hour. Among all this election chaos comes the US non-farm jobs report for October. Now, one could argue that this is the most pointless non-farm Friday of the year given the proximity of the election, and the fact that the month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting has already happened. However, the Fed stated on Wednesday that it only needs to see a bit more evidence that the US economy is in decent health before it feels confident enough to raise rates meaning that, in the eventuality of a Clinton victory, today\u2019s set of jobs data may become more important in retrospect. Economists are expecting a payrolls to rise by 175,000... The pound has hit a four-week high against the dollar at $1.2497, up o.2% on the day. The rise in the pound is partly a story of dollar weakness, but also Thursday\u2019s message from the Bank of England that a rate cut is off the table for now, and the government\u2019s Brexit loss in the High Court: Oil prices are on course for a sixth day of declines, driven lower by a rise in US crude stocks and softer demand. Brent crude oil is down 0.3% at $46.20. Analysts said markets were also being hit by investor nerves, as traders pull out money ahead of the US presidential election. Oliver Jakob from the consultancy Petromatrix told Reuters: There has been a very strong retreat and technically, prices are starting to reach oversold levels. Investors will look at US non farm payrolls later in the day but I think there will be a pause for a few days ahead of the US elections. Consumer appetite for new cars has seemed unstoppable in recent years as cheap finance deals and more efficient models have boosted the number of deals. UK new car sales increased again in October, but at a slower rate of 1.4%, compared with 1.6 in September - a plate change month when sales are typically higher. Fleet sales drove the rise in October, while private sales fell 1.1% compared with the same month last year according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. A total of 180,168 new cars were registered in the UK last month, taking the total in the first 10 months of the year to 2.3 million - 2.5% higher than at the same point in 2015. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: September\u2019s number plate change is always a hard act to follow so the market\u2019s growth in October, albeit moderate, is welcome news. Low interest rates, affordable finance packages and a range of exciting new models helped attract buyers into showrooms and we now look to government to ensure consumer and business confidence remains buoyant.\u201d As election anxiety reigns, the S&amp;P 500 is on course for its longest losing streak since 1980 if it falls again today. CMC Markets are predicting US markets will open lower. Market analyst Jasper Lawler: Stocks in the US look set for a lower open with investors fretting over the election ahead of the October non-farm payrolls report that could act to confirm a move to higher interest rates in December. There is some selling-exhaustion in US equities so the unemployment figures could help form a short-term base before the election next week. The market is assigning an 80% chance the Fed will hike rates in December so it would take a huge labour market downturn for a single unemployment report to change the course of monetary policy. Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital, says markets are on a \u201cknife-edge\u201d before Americans go to the polls on Tuesday: With Donald Trump having closed the gap on Hillary Clinton the election result is too close to call and markets are on a knife-edge. There is a definite sense we\u2019re heading for a Brexit-like event \u2013 if Trump wins there could be a sharper selloff in risky assets like stocks and the US dollar. If Clinton wins, a rally is on the cards. Ignoring the longer-term implications, there is a strong chance of immediate and significant movements in prices \u2013 particularly as we get results in from key swing states such as Ohio and Florida. And because so many hang in the balance there is a strong chance that markets will overreact when an individual state is called. Back in June the pound plunged 5% in a matter of seconds when Sunderland voted heavily for Leave. We could see similar gyrations in a broader range of markets, particularly if volumes are down overnight. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been giving radio interviews following the Bank\u2019s updated forecasts and decision to hold rates on Thursday. The Bank raised its forecasts for growth in the short-term, admitting it had been too pessimistic about prospects in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Policymakers at Threadneedle Street were predicting growth of just 0.1% in the third quarter, but it came in much stronger at 0.5%. The Bank also told households to prepare for a sharp rise in inflation next year. Broadbent said it was perfectly normal to adjust expectations \u201cas news comes in\u201d. He told BBC Radio 4 Today\u2019s programme that he was pleased Mark Carney would remain as the Bank\u2019s governor until 2019, a year longer than he initially signed up for: I\u2019m extremely happy that the current governor is staying. I think the whole country should be grateful that he is. European markets are falling deeper into the red as unease continues to build ahead of Tuesday\u2019s US election. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, offers this insight into markets and the election. While the political risk has increased with national polls narrowing, Clinton continues to have the lead. CNN polls indicate that Clinton has a 46% to 45% lead of Trump. Heading into the last weekend before America heads to the polls, anything can happen. Markets should continue to trade with caution ahead of the weekend and the US election, with risk skewed to the downside. History suggests that regardless of who is in the White House (think President Obama), the USA still remains largely unaffected by a single individual. The numbers are all in now, and the broad indication from the eurozone PMIs is that the signal currency bloc\u2019s economy gained momentum in October, mainly thanks to Germany. The composite PMI (combining manufacturing surveys earlier in the week and services surveys today) rose to 53.3 in October from 52.6 in September. Here is how countries ranked on the PMI by output growth. (Anything above 50 signals growth.) Germany: 55.1 Spain: 54.4 Ireland: 54 France: 51.6 Italy: 51.1 Markit\u2019s Germany services sector PMI showed steady growth in October. The headline index edged up to 54.2 from 54.1 in September, in line with expectations. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at IHS Markit, said the survey from Europe\u2019s largest economy was positive: Today\u2019s survey results present a welcome rebound in German service sector activity, after September\u2019s data highlighted fears of a substantial slowdown in the sector. The service sector data follow positive numbers from the manufacturing sector, released earlier in the week. The combined output of both sectors points to the second-strongest rate of expansion so far this year and suggests that the German economy continued to grow at the start of the fourth quarter. Growth slowed in the French services sector in October according to the PMI. The headline index fell to 51.4 from 52.1 on September, missing forecasts that growth would be stable. Markit said companies were not seeing a big pick up in new business growth. Alex Gill: Growth in the French service sector abated at the start of the fourth quarter, with activity increasing at the slowest rate in three months. This was indicative of waning new business growth, as further solid cuts to output prices proved insufficient to prevent the slide. On a more positive note, business expectations remained strong, suggesting companies are hopeful conditions will continue to improve in the months ahead. The Italian services sector grew in October, albeit at a weak rate. The headline index on Markit\u2019s PMI rose to 51 from 50.7 in September, where anything above 50 signals expansion. It was a little below expectations of 51.5. This is what Markit\u2019s Phil Smith had to say: It\u2019s been a sluggish start to the fourth quarter for Italy\u2019s economy. While expansion in service sector activity picked up slightly in October, it remained weak overall and was countered by a slowdown in growth of manufacturing output. There was also little to cheer on the employment front, with the rate of job creation across the two sectors combined barely stronger than September\u2019s 12-month low. Growth in Spain\u2019s services sector was roughly stable in October, but the pick up in new orders and employment slowed. The headline index on Markit\u2019s PMI eased to 54.6 last month from 54.7 in September, but it was lower than expected, with economists polled by Reuters predicting 55.2. Inflationary signs were evident, with the sharpest increase in companies\u2019 costs since May 2015. IHS Markit is forecasting the Spanish economy will grow by 3.1% in 2016, slowing to 2% in 2017. Andrew Harker, senior economist at IHS Markit: While the headline activity index for the Spain services PMI suggested further solid growth in October, other indices were less bullish. Rates of increase in new orders and employment eased and companies suggested that sales wins were often a result of promotional activities. Europe has followed Asia and the US, with markets down in early trading. The FTSE 100 is off 53 points. FTSE 100: -0.8% at 6,737 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.4% at 10,282 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 4,404 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.5% at 16,333 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 8,854 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.4% at 330 The pound rose on Thursday to a near one-month high of $1.2494 (still 16% lower than the day of the EU referendum). It was boosted by a number of factors, including the government\u2019s loss of the Brexit case at the High Court, the signal from the Bank of England that further rate cuts are off the table for the time being, and a weaker dollar. The pound is roughly flat this morning, at $1.2466. It\u2019s non-farm payrolls day in the US. The figures will be published at 12.30pm UK time and are expected to show a 175,000 jump in jobs added in October, following 156,000 in September. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 4.9% from 5%. The payrolls data are closely watched and economists and investors will be looking for anything in the data that suggests a Fed rate rise in December is more or less likely. Realistically however, the presidential election on Tuesday will be uppermost in investor minds, rather than the payrolls report and implications for December. Also this morning we have the latest healthcheck from the eurozone\u2019s services sector, with October PMI surveys. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the world are turning their attention to the US presidential election on Tuesday next week. With the polls narrowing, uncertainty is rising, and with so many twists and turns in the campaign so far, investor nerves are mounting as the poll draws closer. Wall Street closed down for an eighth successive day on Friday, marking the longest run of losses since the financial crisis in 2008. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, gives this insight: With only a few more days to US polling day the closeness of the polls continues to jangle nerves in the market, with the result that the declines appear to be gaining a momentum all of their own. This negative sentiment is also spilling over into Europe\u2019s markets as they also slip back as the weaker US dollar pushes up the pound and the euro, as we look again at the potential for another negative open this morning. Most Asian markets followed Wall Street lower, with the Nikkei down 1.3% at 16,905. Meanwhile the Vix volatility index \u2013 a measure of investor confidence known as the \u201cfear gauge\u201d \u2013 rose for the eighth day in succession. European stock markets are also expected to open lower:"
"22||A night tsar is born: who is Amy Lam\u00e9?Name: Amy Lam\u00e9. Real name: Amy Caddle. Age: 45. Appearance: About as far removed from Tsar Nicholas II as you can imagine. Why mention him? Because Lam\u00e9 has just been made a governmental tsar. After tsars for families, social mobility, pensions and hundreds of other subjects, she is the latest to be given this odd title. A tsar is born? The old ones are the best. And what is she going to be tsar of? Going out and getting pissed in London. Mayor Sadiq Khan has made her \u201cnight tsar\u201d, tasked (as they invariably say) with turning the capital into a 24-hour city. I thought London already was a 24-hour city. Don\u2019t quibble. Khan reckons proper planning can add up to \u00a33bn to the night-time economy. Nice job. Indeed. The salary is about \u00a335,000 for a two-and-a-half-day week. Shouldn\u2019t she be working nights? I thought that too. She has said the first thing she\u2019ll do is go on a fact-finding mission in the bars and clubs of London. On expenses? How dare you! What qualifies her for the job? \u201cAmy has a long and successful track record as a leader and collaborator in the cultural and creative industries,\u201d says the mayor\u2019s office. She likes a good night out. Your words, not mine. Born in New Jersey but based in the UK since she was 21, she\u2019s a Labour activist and was mayor of Camden in 2010-11. She is best known as a comedian, with one-woman shows including Gay Man Trapped in a Lesbian\u2019s Body and Cum Manifesto. She was a presenter on the seminal BBC2 show Gaytime TV, co-founded the Duckie arts collective that performs at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in south London, and has written what she claims is the first gay history book aimed at children. She\u2019s not gay, is she? Not much is getting past you today. Does the Daily Mail know about this? Let\u2019s hope not. Not to be confused with: Sir Philip Green, the former government efficiency tsar. A fallen tsar? Oh, go away. Do say: \u201cGreat news. At last, someone will stand up [sic] for London\u2019s beleaguered nightclubs.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cRidiculous stunt. What about a tsar for affordable housing?\u201d"
"6||Prank call mystery surrounds Ukraine presidentIt was a routine bit of international diplomacy: two presidents speaking for an hour about \u201ctopical issues of the agenda of Ukraine-Kyrgyzstan relations\u201d, as the press release on the website of the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, put it on Wednesday. Poroshenko asked his counterpart about potential support for a forthcoming Ukrainian initiative at the UN to condemn Russian human rights abuses in annexed Crimea. The only problem is that the Kyrgyz president, Almazbek Atambayev, says he never made the call. Ukrainian authorities are scrambling to work out who Poroshenko spent an hour on the phone with. Suspicion is likely to fall on a pair of Russian hoaxers who have made a habit of embarrassing world leaders with fake calls, and whose pranks often seem to align with Russian state interests. Alexei Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov, better known as Lexus and Vovan, made the headlines last year when they called Sir Elton John pretending to be the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. Putin later called the singer to assuage his embarrassment at falling for the hoax. In April, editors at the New York Times held a conference call with a man claiming to be Poroshenko, after the newspaper received a letter complaining about coverage of Ukraine in its pages. It transpired the call was a hoax. Poroshenko has attracted the attention of the pranksters on numerous occasions, but previously he has been impersonated rather than pranked himself. In February, Stolyarov and Kuznetsov reached the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, pretending to be Poroshenko. Stolyarov declined to comment when asked by the Guardian whether he was responsible for the fake Kyrgyz call. It is one thing to fool a newspaper or celebrity, and quite another to be able to place hoax calls claiming to be a president calling his counterpart in another country. Such calls are usually set up using elaborate protocol and using special secure lines, prompting many to believe the pranksters must have help from Russia\u2019s FSB security service. Stolyarov and Kuznetsov have denied claims they work for or with the FSB. \u201cWe work for ourselves, nobody else,\u201d Stolyarov told the Guardian in March. The news item about the call was quietly removed from the Ukrainian president\u2019s website, and on Thursday the Kyrgyz and Ukrainian foreign ministers spoke by telephone and attempted to smooth over the incident. A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokeswoman said: \u201cBoth we and the Kyrgyz side are looking into this planned provocation. We will work out all the circumstances, including the technical details. It\u2019s already clear that the goal of this kind of action is to disrupt Ukraine\u2019s important UN initiatives over Crimea.\u201d"

"29||Guardian US mobile innovation lab to offer live election results on mobile lock screensNew York, NY, November 4, 2016: The Guardian US mobile innovation lab today announces the launch of the most dynamic 2016 presidential election results notifications that have ever been available through a news app, uniquely delivered directly to mobile lock screens for Guardian iOS and Android app users. The lab, working with the Guardian\u2019s in-house app development team, will bring real time updates not just to the web or within an app, but to the lock screen for the first time. The updating alert will deliver instantaneous, up-to-the-minute results with the latest Associated Press election data, automatically loaded directly to lock screens for Guardian app users who sign up. Readers will receive the latest information within one continuously updated notification, which will be always visible without additional taps, searches, or further access to a mobile app. Users will see the latest number of electoral votes won, how many states have been called, and the breakdown of the popular vote between the top two candidates. The notifications will then allow users to open the alert and access a live data visualization of the results and have the option to tap through to the live blog or the full results pages. Sarah Schmalbach, product manager for the Guardian US mobile innovation lab, comments: \u201cThis will be the quickest and most convenient way to get live election night results on mobile. We\u2019re the first to take advantage of this brand new mobile alert feature, that allows us to update the latest data straight on readers\u2019 lock screens. No news app, or any other mobile app, has said they\u2019ll be doing this on November 8th.\u201d The notifications for the presidential election build on the success of live data notifications tested as part of the mobile innovation lab\u2019s experiment during the UK referendum on EU membership in June 2016. Sasha Koren, editor of the lab says: \u201cIn adapting the technology the lab has built, and by applying the lessons we learned during the Brexit experiment, our goal is to bring live results notifications to a larger stage and to serve a wider audience during the biggest news event of the year. By adopting these notifications formats, the Guardian is taking the opportunity both to innovate within news delivery and to bring US election results to mobile users in the most accessible way possible.\u201d US app users will be prompted to sign up for live results notification via an opt-in screen starting November 4th and the alerts will be available globally through the Guardian\u2019s app notification settings.

"30||In love with winter swimming: \u2018I like to feel the elements on my skin. It\u2019s nourishing\u2019Every winter, people who have enjoyed outdoor summer swimming challenge themselves to continue through the colder, darker months. For those who manage to keep going through that first season, cold-water swimming often becomes a lifelong passion. If you have already taken the plunge, or are considering whether to embark on a winter season, three new short films, all showing at this month\u2019s Kendal Mountain Festival, will inspire you. We spoke to the three women who feature in the films. Vivienne Rickman-Poole Just watching the first few minutes of Afterglow sends a chill through you; the camera pans over snow-dusted hills in Snowdonia, the light is a cold blue-grey, the lake dark and forbidding. Vivienne stands at the water\u2019s edge, rubbing her red hands together before undressing. You almost hold your breath when she walks into the freezing mountain lake. Afterglow follows Vivienne as she sets off alone across the snowy landscape of Snowdonia to an isolated mountain lake. It\u2019s certainly at the more extreme end of winter swimming, but Rickman-Poole has been swimming outside since she was a child \u2013 and in Snowdonia\u2019s lakes for years \u2013 and is passionate about cold water. She might be standing in the snow shivering but inside she\u2019s glowing. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling of being enveloped in freshness \u2013 it\u2019s almost a craving \u2013 and that\u2019s what you do it for.\u201d There\u2019s no shortage of fresh water where Rickman-Poole lives in Snowdonia but she does have a favourite spot. \u201cThere is one particular lake \u2013 Llyn Du\u2019r Arddu \u2013 it\u2019s a 90-minute walk from my house; the cliffs around it are very dark and imposing (arddu means dark), but the water is the most incredible blue. It almost feels bottomless.\u201d In the film Rickman-Poole talks about the allure of deep water. \u201cI\u2019m always searching for that abyss. It gives you a real clarity of thought.\u201d It sounds alarming, but watching her floating in a huge dark body of water surrounded by mountains you start to see the appeal of being so immersed in nature. As a photographer, she is as interested in the way the female body moves in water as she is the mental experience of it. She has photographed herself underwater but her current project is less intimate, more epic. Two years ago she embarked on Swim Snowdonia, a project to explore every body of water in Snowdonia and record her experience of each one photographically, whether it\u2019s dipping her toes in or a full swim. She puts the surge in popularity of outdoor swimming down, in part, to austerity: \u201cWe want freedom but also to do things for free and anyone can get into water \u2013 we don\u2019t have to pay a huge amount of money.\u201d Her advice for people starting out is to listen to your body: \u201cStart off in a wetsuit to get used to it and then just do everything very slowly until you feel right. Get out when you start to feel cold, get to know your own body and its limitations.\u201d Afterglow, by Eyes and Ears films, will be introduced by Vivienne Rickman-Poole at the Outdoor Swimming session on Sunday 20 November at the Kendal Mountain Festival Kari Furre \u201cI started swimming outdoors when it was called \u2018going for a swim\u2019,\u201d says Kari Furre, an artist who is profiled in a new short film that is part of the Mountain Journal Short series from outdoor brand Alpkit. \u201cI was having an annual mid-life crisis and I did one of the early Swimtrek holidays in the Greek islands. Then it suddenly occurred to me that you could swim outside in England. It was crazy. All through the 1970s and 80s the water quality wasn\u2019t good. You were advised not to swim in rivers or reservoirs and you didn\u2019t question it. But I started to swim outside, and I met Kate Rew on a Thames swim and together we set up the Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS).\u201d The film shows Furre swimming the length of Windermere, a 10.5-mile challenge that took her just over six hours. \u201cNot bad for a grandma,\u201d as she puts it (Furre is 67). In fact it\u2019s a pretty good time for anyone. It can take up to eight hours. But Furre is no stranger to long distance swimming, which she describes as \u201clike a yoga practise\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t do it as a sports practise with gadgets and watches. There\u2019s a meditative quality to it.\u201d As well as being a founding member the OSS, she also established the hugely popular Dart 10k, which this year attracted 1,600 participants over two days (a significant increase from 200 in 2009). The Dart is still one of her favourite places to swim. \u201cI live in near Totnes in south Devon and am lucky to have some great swimming places nearby. There\u2019s Dartmoor with rivers falling off it all over the place and we\u2019ve got a really nice coastline. Thurlestone Rock is a lovely reef \u2013 you can see kelp and spider crabs \u2013 it\u2019s like swimming over a garden. At the estuary on the river Avon you get a fantastic current and there are lovely pools in the upper parts of the Dart.\u201d As for cold-water swimming, she\u2019s not as keen on it as others, and wears a wetsuit in winter (a no-no for more militant swimmers). But she certainly makes it look easy in the film, standing on the Sugary Cove beach, near Dartmouth Castle, in a wetsuit and woolly hat, before calmly walking into the chilly water and setting off around the cliffs. \u201cMy advice for anyone getting started is to just keep swimming [when the summer ends]. When you get into very cold water it takes 60-90 seconds for your body to give in so you have to go through that barrier: so it\u2019s horrible for 90 seconds then you feel fine. Afterwards, you\u2019ve got about five or 10 minutes and then the cool blood whooshes into your core and you get something called the \u2018after drop\u2019, so you need to get dressed warmly and have a hot drink before that.\u201d Furre will be introducing the Alpkit film at the festival\u2019s Outdoor Swimming session on 20 November. Furre offers private swimming lessons (to book, email her at kari at furre.co.uk) Natasha Brooks For her latest film, Brooks left her home territory of Snowdonia and travelled to the Highlands. The Bothy Project follows three artists \u2013 as well as Natasha, a filmmaker, there was poet and writer Claire-Jane Carter and painter Tessa Lyons \u2013 as they escape to a remote bothy and explore their surroundings. As with Rickman-Poole, Brooks usually goes for solitary swims in the lakes of Snowdonia (as documented in her film Bluehue) but swimming in the Highlands felt very different. \u201cI know Snowdonia well; it\u2019s a lot more visited. In Scotland, there\u2019s a massive expanse of wilderness. The loch I swam in is large and there are mountains on each side, and when I came up for breath I could see those huge peaks on either side. It felt bigger and wilder.\u201d For Brooks swimming outside is something she\u2019s always done and always will. \u201cI don\u2019t come here to train,\u201d she says in Bluehue. \u201cI come to experience the water and all that goes with it. I like to feel the elements on my skin and be connected to the seasonal changes. It\u2019s nourishing.\u201d Cold water, she says, \u201ccuts through everything, it\u2019s so physical. You don\u2019t necessarily have to swim far. You need mental strength to make yourself get in that situation, then there\u2019s the physical rush of being so cold; you can go in for a short time and you feel like you\u2019ve done something quite big. Going for a jog for a few minutes doesn\u2019t have the same effect. You get out of cold water and feel so alive, your skin is zinging from the cold.\u201d For those starting out she advises caution: \u201cIf you keep going regularly, you are going to acclimatise, but if you haven\u2019t been swimming over the summer, go with someone. Don\u2019t just jump into a deep body of water. The temperatures are dropping now and it\u2019s a real shock, so walk in and know where you can get out.\u201d The Bothy Project directed by Jen Randall will be screened from 6pm on Friday 18 November at the Lowe Alpine Bothy event space as part of the festival.

"6||French police move 4,000 people out of Paris migrant campFrench authorities have cleared nearly 4,000 people from Paris\u2019s biggest makeshift migrant camp, insisting those moved would be given shelter, food and support, and helped with asylum applications. In a pre-dawn operation, police sealed off the sprawling ad-hoc shanty town of tents and cardboard shelters that stretches for almost 1,000 metres (3,300ft) from under the arches of the Stalingrad M\u00e9tro bridge. A fleet of 80 buses took men, women, children and groups of unaccompanied minors out of the area. The operation was organised jointly by the state and Paris city authorities. Officials said families and those considered vulnerable would be housed in and around the capital, while lone male migrants would be taken to reception centres around the country. Humanitarian organisations said people were not being told where they were going and that they feared for those not eligible for asylum in France. However, those who jostled to board buses seemed relieved \u2013 even happy \u2013 to be going. \u201cIt would be good to know where we are being taken, but it will be better than sleeping here,\u201d said one woman, who did not wish to be named. The loudest protests came from French campaigners, who shouted insults at police and City Hall chiefs, but the evacuation passed off without violence. Earlier in the week, fights had broken out as tensions rose. Hundreds of CRS riot police carrying shields and batons had arrived at the ad hoc camp at about 6am. They found the camp\u2019s occupants waiting for them. Word had already gone around that the camp would be broken up in an early-morning operation, and many of those living on the street, among them Afghans, Eritreans, Sudanese and Ethiopians, had packed their few belongings into battered suitcases and plastic bags. Some even folded up their tents and stood waiting, duvets draped around their shoulders to keep out the morning chill. The scene was already bleak; then it began to rain. Locals and humanitarian organisations handed out baguettes and biscuits to women and toddlers, who were given priority on the buses. Marine, 28, an actor living nearby, said she had been visiting the Stalingrad camp for six months. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t possible to just sit at home while there was all this misery around me. I felt I had to do something. Many of the migrants were people my own age and we formed a strong bond. Today, I\u2019m afraid for them.\u201d The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, turned up to support the clearance and spoke to a group of Eritrean teenagers, standing out of the rain in a bus shelter waiting to be evacuated. \u201cDo you have houses for us?\u201d one 16-year-old asked in broken English. The mayor reassured them they would be given a roof over their heads. Hidalgo said breaking up the squalid open-air camp was essential. Finding accommodation for the thousands camped at Stalingrad would enable the authorities to start with a clean slate and control the flow of new refugees in the French capital \u2013 estimated at 80 a day \u2013 in a \u201chumane manner\u201d, she added. A new reception centre will open in the north of Paris next week. \u201cParis attracts people, but the problem is one that the whole of France needs to deal with. We cannot have camps of this nature in the city. We cannot have people living in such dirty, undignified circumstances,\u201d Hidalgo told the Guardian. \u201cThese people need a proper place to sleep. How on earth can refugees or migrants think about their futures if they\u2019ve had no sleep, or been sleeping on the street, and have had nothing to eat. Once they have a roof over their heads, they can reflect on what they will do.\u201d She also praised local residents for their \u201cpatience and solidarity\u201d. Alain Guillo, who lives in the 18th arrondissement, said residents and refugees had existed in \u201cdeplorable health conditions\u201d in recent months. The number of migrants living rough increased to a record number after the closure of the Calais camp last week. Despite about 30 attempts to move people on and clear the area in the last 18 months, they have always returned. \u201cIn the end, it grew so large that it was no longer a refugee camp in a district, it was a district inside a refugee camp. What we wanted was dignity for all: residents and refugees,\u201d Guillo said."
"18||The Lego Batman Movie: five things we learned from new trailerIf DC\u2019s \u201cexpanded universe\u201d continues to struggle \u2013 and this week saw upcoming movie The Flash lose its second director \u2013 studio Warner Bros might want to consider shrinking its entire roster of colorful crimefighters down and just make Lego superhero movies instead. For there is more joie de vivre in the new three-minute trailer for The Lego Batman Movie than there was in the entirety of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice \u2013 and I\u2019m including the extended edition in that equation. Here are five takeaways from our latest look at the tiny, plastic plaything who\u2019s fast making Batfleck look like yesterday\u2019s dark knight. This caped crusader has had a personality upgrade The Batman we met in The Lego Movie aways seemed an unlikely candidate for his own solo film, a pompous jerk who was more Flash Thompson than Bruce Wayne. But this time around, despite his vast wealth and playboy lifestyle, our Will Arnett-voiced caped crusader is being painted as a far more sympathetic superhero. It appears a life lived all alone in one\u2019s echoing mansion, eating cordon bleu TV dinners and trying to get all your gadgets to sync properly is a rather lonely one. Hence, The Lego Movie looks like it will focus on Batman\u2019s transition from solo operator to leader of an extended family of masked vigilantes, with Robin and Batgirl also pulling on their costumes for the first time. Sound familiar? Yes, it\u2019s the plot of Batman &amp; Robin all over again, but without the Batnipples and painful script. Some serious synopsizing of typical Batman mythos has gone down Barbara Gordon, AKA Batgirl, AKA Oracle, has been through almost as many alternate versions as the dark knight himself over the years. The Lego Batman Movie pitches a new iteration of the superhero who is both Batgirl and Commissioner Gordon, the role usually played by her father James. (The 2007 comic Batman #666, which imagined a future dystopian Gotham, pulled the same trick.) Gordon appears to be set on dropping the Gotham City police department\u2019s traditional public opposition to Batman\u2019s activities in favour of working alongside the dark knight. Has she got the hots for the caped crusader? At least, this being a kids\u2019 movie, we can guarantee they\u2019re not about to go all Killing Joke on us. Michael Cera\u2019s Robin is an eye-poppingly irritating riff on the boy wonder\u2019s reviled status Given Cera often pops up on mean lists of actors who Hollywood forgot about, you might think he\u2019s being rather brave taking on the role that killed Chris O\u2019Donnell\u2019s career. But rather than trying to rehabilitate Robin \u2013 a character who comic book fans famously once voted should be killed off \u2013 The Lego Batman Movie seems more than happy for us to carry on hating him. This particular boy wonder, resembling the Carrie Kelley version from The Dark Knight Returns, is an eye-poppingly irritating creation whose sole purpose seems to be to wind Batman up with his perky overenthusiasm and skimpy outfits. The new Joker is a lovesick puppy From The Killing Joke to The Dark Knight, Batman stories have often hinted at the symbiotic connection between the caped crusader and his green-haired nemesis \u2013 remember Heath Ledger\u2019s spiky nod to Jerry Maguire? But The Lego Batman Movie seems to be taking the twisted love-hate thing to a whole new level. Informed that Superman is the dark knight\u2019s true enemy \u2013 a neat Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice reference \u2013 the villain finds himself unexpectedly reduced to tears, his cackling exterior ripped away to reveal the soggy little puppy dog beneath. Might Batman come to regret such coarse and casual contempt further down the line? It doesn\u2019t matter that this is the second Batman film in as many years If this new trailer shows us anything, it\u2019s that the world needs a little more meta-fuelled superhero satire. And with more than half a century of movies, comic books and TV shows to riff on, Batman seems to be the perfect target. Warner Bros might be responsible for having turned the caped crusader into a gun-toting, knuckle-headed bore, but at least the studio knows how to have a joke at its own expense. If Chris McKay\u2019s film registers with audiences on the level that The Lego Movie did, one imagines they\u2019ll be laughing all the way to the Gotham National Bank."
"21||Can moaning ever make you happy?There\u2019s a man in Colorado who, it\u2019s safe to say, is pretty irritated by the noise of aircraft approaching and leaving Denver airport, 30 miles from his house. How irritated, exactly? In 2015, he made 3,555 complaints out of 4,870 received by the airport, according to a new research paper. And he\u2019s not unique. Five people made 61% of the complaints about Portland airport, and in Washington, DC, \u201ctwo individuals at one residence\u201d clocked up 6,852 complaints in a year against Ronald Reagan Washington National airport. (About the noise, I mean. No word on how many complained about it being named after Reagan.) As an inveterate maker of official complaints myself, I confess to some admiration for these moaners. Yes, I know the adage that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly, while expecting different results. But there\u2019s a cosmic defiance here that I respect. The world may be enraging and absurd \u2013 yet at least someone has the self-respect to keep protesting against that fact. It won\u2019t make them happy, though. These findings illustrate how irritation and complaint are self-reinforcing: objecting to something you can\u2019t control brings a moment of catharsis, but mainly makes things worse, by increasing the attention you bring to the problem, which makes it more intrusive. You end up listening more acutely for the next noise and getting more irritated when it comes. It\u2019s stressful even when there\u2019s no noise, because you\u2019re on edge, waiting for the silence to be broken. No wonder a single complaint becomes hundreds: the complaining is nourishing the problem. This gets easier to see if you think about these minor irritations like a difficulty encountered in a relationship \u2013 in this case, between you and your environment. Railing against them is like falling out with your partner, then continuing, over and over, to pick further fights for the sake of it. And when has that ever helped? As so often, the Buddhists figured this out before most of us. The \u201cfirst noble truth\u201d of Buddhism is often translated as \u201clife is suffering\u201d, but that\u2019s a bit melodramatic; it implies constant agony, when for most of us that\u2019s thankfully rare. The word in question, dukkha, means something closer to \u201cunsatisfactoriness\u201d. Life can be wonderful, awful or somewhere in between, but there\u2019s always an undertow of not-quite-right-ness: either what\u2019s happening is unpleasant, or it\u2019s pleasant but you know it must end. The aircraft noise complainer is mired deep in dukkha, unhappy when a plane is passing, and unhappy when one isn\u2019t, because the silence can\u2019t last. One big Buddhist insight is that this dissatisfaction doesn\u2019t arise from our circumstances themselves, but from the way we try to attain happiness, by lining up our circumstances just right, then keeping them fixed in place for good. It\u2019s a quest that\u2019s doomed to fail, since nothing lasts. Planes come, planes go, and you\u2019re happy to the extent that you don\u2019t mind that fact. Though I think the Buddha did make an exception for that \u201cjaunty whistle\u201d Samsung ringtone. That\u2019s just legitimately horrendous. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"
"18||War, love and weirdness: A Matter of Life and Death \u2013 70 years onThe opening scenes of A Matter of Life and Death are among the most audacious and moving ever confected by the cinematic magicians Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. After the whump of arrow on target that announces a production by the Archers, we are pitched into the blue-black vasts of space \u2013 the film-makers had consulted Arthur C Clarke about the design of their cosmos \u2013 where a voiceover guides us past eerie nebulae and exploding stars to our own fretful corner of the universe. On Earth it\u2019s the night of 2 May 1945, a thousand-bomber raid has left a German city in flames, and British pilots have turned for home. Fog rolls across the screen, radios crackle with the voices of Hitler and Churchill. \u201cListen,\u201d says the narrator, echoing a line of Caliban\u2019s in The Tempest, \u201clisten to all the noises in the air.\u201d Cut to a red-lit control room, a sinister nest of Anglepoise lamps, and in their midst a young American radio operator named June (played by Kim Hunter) who is trying to speak to the pilot of a damaged Lancaster as it limps across the Channel. The bomber is on fire, its fuselage gaping, ruined instruments rattling around behind Peter Carter (David Niven) as he recites into the ether lines of poetry by Raleigh and Marvell. His crew have all bailed out or been killed; the plane\u2019s undercarriage is gone, and with it any hope of landing safely. Will he jump too? Yes, he tells June; but there\u2019s a catch: \u201cI\u2019ve got no parachute.\u201d The exchange that follows between the Boston-born WAAF and the doomed English airman is absurdly (and knowingly) exalted: \u201cYou\u2019re life, June, and I\u2019m leaving you!\u201d On the film\u2019s release 70 years ago, some critics balked at the cardboard romanticism of the scene. But I\u2019d challenge anyone to stay untouched to its end, watching Peter steady himself for a chuteless fall into the fog. Miraculously, the young pilot survives, and is washed up on a beach in Devon, where he meets June cycling across the sands. But Peter was meant to die, and the authorities in the next world will not let him go, just because he has fallen in love. So far everything has been in ravishing colour, but suddenly we are in a black-and-white modernist heaven where the first bureaucratic mistake in centuries has set off celestial alarm bells. A heavenly \u201cconductor\u201d \u2013 Marius Goring as a French aristo fop \u2013 is dispatched to retrieve the undead man, but Peter resists, and a trial looms at which he must plead for more time on earth. A Matter of Life and Death is a self-consciously Shakespearean comedy of sorts, and a lurid experiment in cinematic colour and scenography. But it\u2019s also an end-of-war reflection on the living and the dead, including those who have been missing for a time, stranded in between. The film began as an expressly propagandist project. Jack Beddington, head of film at the Ministry of Information, asked Powell and Pressburger over lunch: \u201cCan\u2019t you two fellows think up a good idea to improve Anglo-American relations?\u201d By the time they made \u201cAMOLAD\u201d (as all involved called it), the Kentish director and Hungarian screenwriter had twice exceeded their war-effort brief, with controversial results. The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp \u2013 whose star Roger Livesey returned in A Matter of Life and Death as the neurologist Frank Reeves \u2013 scandalised Churchill with its portrait of a good German and its mockery of a certain English bluster. And in A Canterbury Tale, Powell and Pressburger revelled in a twisted vision of old England at the near-gothic (but again comical) expense of the film\u2019s message about Anglo-American cooperation before D-day. There were other origins and influences at work. In 1944 the German press reported that a British rear gunner had fallen 18,000ft into a snow drift and survived. Three years earlier, the Times had published posthumously \u201cAn Airman\u2019s Letter to his Mother\u201d: a young man\u2019s fearless and somewhat pompous missive about his willingness to die in battle. Powell made a short film around the text (which was read by John Gielgud) but though he greatly admired the core message of the letter, he removed a passage about the war being \u201ca very good thing\u201d, and another about the British empire, \u201cwhere there is a measure of peace, justice and freedom for all\u201d. At the end of the war, troubled by spectres from beyond, the airman of A Matter of Life and Death fears he may be \u201ccracked\u201d. But he has no historical delusions; one of the first things he tells June, from his burning cockpit, is that he is \u201cConservative by instinct, Labour by experience\u201d. Pressburger had delivered to Powell a more obviously ghostly script, complete with transparent emissaries from the other side, from which the director tried to excise as many conventional signs of the supernatural as possible: there\u2019s only one instance, for example, of anybody walking through walls. (This is not Blithe Spirit, even if both films turn at the end on similar high-speed road accidents.) Powell was determined that both Earth and heaven \u2013 it\u2019s only called that indirectly, in a fleeting cameo by Richard Attenborough \u2013 would be solid and consistent, though each is exotic in its way. And though the neurological explanations for Peter\u2019s visitations from the afterlife can seem hokey \u2013 \u201cYou mean ... insanity?\u201d asks a colleague of Reeves\u2019 portentously \u2013 Powell did his best to base the visions and other symptoms on recent medical literature. The plot takes the risk of combining time travel, psychiatric melodrama and divine or supernatural intervention on Earth: all of which themes had recently been explored in other movies, though not yet in the same heady mix. The film recalls aspects of Hitchcock\u2019s Spellbound from the previous year, Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s Heaven Can Wait (1943) and most obviously Frank Capra\u2019s It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, which was released around the same time as the Archers\u2019 film. Pressburger had already conjured a prototype heaven in his screenplay for Max Oph\u00fcls\u2019s first film, I\u2019d Rather Have Cod Liver Oil. There are reminders also of William Cameron Menzies\u2019 Things to Come, from a decade before: the Archers\u2019 sci-fi heaven is all gleaming white with transparent plastic furniture, and the newly arrived dead receive their angelic wings in cellophane dry-cleaning bags. But the most seductive element in the film\u2019s magical relay between heaven and Earth is its treatment of colour. Filming was delayed for months due to shortage of colour film stock and cameras. The Archers\u2019 established wartime cinematographer Erwin Hillier refused to share a credit with Jack Cardiff, the young Technicolor technician Powell hired for the colour sequences, and so the whole movie was given to Cardiff. He had assumed that Earth would be in black and white, the other world in colour \u2013 The Wizard of Oz supplying the model. But Powell and Pressburger wanted the reverse. Their real world is made of golden light, pink roses, blue skies and June\u2019s scarlet lipstick. Heaven is all sparse and pearly monochrome, shot by Cardiff on colour stock without the usual dyes, so that seamless dissolves could be effected between worlds. Its melodramatic opening apart, the film\u2019s most celebrated moment comes when Conductor 71 first appears on Earth, among big blushing rhododendrons, and quips: \u201cOne is starved for Technicolor up there.\u201d A Matter of Life and Death was shot on Stage 4 at Denham Studios, where Powell and Pressburger had lately mocked up, with painted flats and blown-up photographs, the interior of Canterbury cathedral for the closing scenes of A Canterbury Tale. Their production designer Alfred Junge was responsible for some of the most dazzling images in the Archers\u2019 work, and this film is replete with exquisite visual inventions. At times these are subtle and sly: the fiery Lancaster that allowed Cardiff to give Niven\u2019s face a sunset glow as he contemplates his end; the heavenly clock that becomes a halo around the head of Kathleen Byron\u2019s empyrean administrator. Junge\u2019s most prodigious contrivance was the 20ft-wide, 106-step, near-silent escalator (nicknamed \u201cEthel\u201d on set) that connected heaven and earth, and gave the film its slightly cowardly US title: Stairway to Heaven. The staircase, with its direct allusion to the motif of Jacob\u2019s ladder in the Bible and The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, is one of the film\u2019s many literary references. (John Bunyan himself puts in an appearance when Dr Reeves arrives in heaven to defend Peter.) Peter Carter is a poet, and Reeves sees the world like a poet, at least according to June. Reeves, the bearded magus, is the most obvious link to The Tempest. Like Prospero, he is a sort of director, preparing the stage for magical or miraculous events, in the end abjuring his own specialist knowledge so that the lovers may thrive in the last scene. When Reeves first meets Peter, it\u2019s in a stately home requisitioned by the US Army, and the troops are rehearsing a production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream \u2013 many key moments in the film unfold in something like Shakespeare\u2019s magical green world, with the principals framed or shadowed by flowers or ferns. In other worlds, A Matter of Life and Death is blatantly theatrical in places, and prepares the way for the Archers\u2019 more stagey later productions, such as The Red Shoes and Oh ... Rosalinda!! But it is also all about film, its art and artifice. Peter is said to be suffering from \u201ca series of highly organised hallucinations, comparable to an experience of actual life\u201d. It sounds like a definition of cinema. When June calls Reeves a poet, it is because she visits him in a camera obscura at the top of his house, from which \u2013 a bravura bit of special-effects work \u2013 he observes on a concave screen all movement in the village below. And in the film\u2019s most obvious play with the wizardry of cinema, Conductor 71 is able to halt time and speak to Peter alone, turning the action around them into a frozen frame or still. On Friday 1 November 1946, thousands of Londoners crowded into Leicester Square to watch the King and Queen attend the premiere of A Matter of Life and Death, which was also the first Royal Command Film Performance. Critical response was mixed. In the Observer, CA Lejeune complained that the film \u201cleaves us in great doubts whether it is intended to be serious or gay\u201d. Others objected, yet again, to a perceived anti-British strain. In France, the great film theorist Andr\u00e9 Bazin reviewed the film, commended its humour and dismissed its design as so much regrettable \u201cplaster and Plexiglas\u201d. Bazin had missed, behind the metaphysical wit and baroque surface, the true strangeness of Powell and Pressburger\u2019s masterpiece, which is after all a version of the Orpheus myth. Four years later, in Orph\u00e9e, Jean Cocteau would film that tale with radio broadcasts, an undead protagonist and otherworldly tribunal \u2013 but the Archers were there first, expressing with amazing lightness of touch a real yearning to bring the war\u2019s dead back to life. \u2022 A Matter of Life and Death is screening at various UK cinemas. powell-pressburger.org/Events"
"21||My boyfriend is 23 years older than me and I worry about being left alone when he diesI\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for two years and we have a stable, loving and wonderful relationship. The only problem is there\u2019s a significant age gap \u2013 I\u2019m 25 and he\u2019s 48. If it wasn\u2019t for this, we\u2019d probably be heading towards marriage and a family in the near future, but we both have some serious reservations about whether continuing is the best thing for me. Mutual friends have encouraged us to go for it, and I\u2019m sure that things would be great for the next 20 years or so, but we have to be pragmatic and think beyond that. Realistically, I wouldn\u2019t expect him to live past his mid 80s at best. While I am not particularly worried about my children having an older father (my siblings and I did), the thought of being a widow for 20-plus years terrifies me. I don\u2019t think I could be happy or fulfilled in the long term without anyone to come home to or to share my daily life with. I have trawled the internet for stories of women who had been widowed at about this age and what I found wasn\u2019t just sad \u2013 it was horrific. Almost without exception the women talked about wanting to die, even years after their husbands\u2019 deaths, and many said the only reason they kept going was to avoid upsetting their children. The possibility of my husband becoming ill and incapacitated at a stage where I want to be active and travel also weighs heavily on my mind. We have discussed these issues openly and at length, and have made multiple attempts to pull away from each other. We have tried to cease contact and have even been living in different cities for the past year, but, as neither of us wants to be apart, we can\u2019t make any of it stick. Just the thought of seeing someone else makes me feel sick and anxious. And there\u2019s no guarantee that separating would mean I\u2019d find someone with whom I\u2019d be happier. Things can\u2019t keep going on like this \u2013 I need to commit or walk away, but I feel paralysed. Neither is a choice I want to make and I\u2019m afraid of being filled with regret years down the track. I\u2019ve been thinking about your letter for some weeks now and what strikes me is your overthinking. You are exploring every possibility, every scenario and in so doing you are, as you say, paralysing yourself. Because you are largely exploring the negatives, with every thought of \u201cwhat if \u2026\u201d you end with a sadness, a disaster. That\u2019s exhausting and pernicious. We tend to overthink when we are anxious and this was one of the first things psychotherapist and couples counsellor Chris Mills picked up on. He felt this might be why \u201cyou are attracted to a man who, chronologically, could be your father [perhaps because he gives you authority or makes you feel safer]. I\u2019m not making any negative judgment about the age gap, as many age-divergent relationships are very happy and successful \u2013 as long as the age difference isn\u2019t the main element driving the attraction.\u201d When we are anxious or unsure, we also want rock-solid guarantees and tend to think in black and white. You say, \u201cI know I need to commit or walk away,\u201d but actually, you don\u2019t. Sometimes the most proactive thing you can do is \u2026 nothing. As Mills says: \u201cThere\u2019s no obvious definitive answer to your dilemma, and not surprisingly you wish there were. You\u2019re reaching for a perfect solution. You\u2019re also trying to map out a risk-free future. Sadly, neither exist and wouldn\u2019t even if you and your boyfriend were similar ages. But why the urgency in either committing or walking away? This question is too important to rush. You\u2019ve got time. I suggest you carry on enjoying each other\u2019s company and carry on talking, and my guess is that in the next few years there\u2019ll be fresh information that will help you both decide. And anyway the decision is just as much your boyfriend\u2019s as it is yours.\u201d I was struck by how catastrophic you felt losing a partner would be and how your life would be, in essence, not worth living. While few would relish the thought of losing a partner, there are many examples of people leading successful and fulfilling lives after the death of one. I feel this needs further exploration, because if you are prone to anxiety, you will find something to catastrophise about in any relationship you go into. I worry you are looking for resilience outside of yourself. What has made you so much in need of absolute certainty? When a decision is so vast, and with this many variables, the key is to shorten the focus. Think about the next year or two. Think about your own self, your life, as well as that with your partner. Do nothing just yet, because I don\u2019t think you are ready to. Remember that if you split up and it\u2019s not the right thing to do, this has the ability to affect all your future relationships, so this relationship has the ability to have an impact, even if you don\u2019t stay in it. You need to explore it further, either until it\u2019s no longer right for you, or you feel going forward with it is. You need to split or stay for concrete reasons, not based on a projection of what might happen.

"18||Army of One review \u2013 Nicolas Cage hunts Osama bin Laden in year's worst comedyIn Army of One, a man who experiences hallucinations due to kidney disease has a vision of God, sparking an ill-advised misadventure. I urge the film\u2019s director, the usually great Larry Charles, to immediately seek a doctor\u2019s care, as I fear he may be suffering from a similar condition. Gary Faulkner, you may or may not recall, was a blip on the news cycle in 2010. He was the daffy Colorado man (the \u201cRocky Mountain Rambo\u201d, we\u2019re reminded) who, with no training, supplies or common sense, took it upon himself to travel to Pakistan to capture Osama bin Laden. He had scraggly hair and an energetic speech pattern so, like this year\u2019s Ken Bone, was briefly feted by the infotainment media. (Army of One\u2019s closing credits feature the real Faulkner babbling on shows like The View.) Somewhere in this mix of religious fervor, wounded national pride and ephemeral albeit mocking fame is the potential for an intriguing film. What we\u2019ve got instead is a movie so rotten any cinema that shows it is in danger of being shut down by the board of health. Nicolas Cage can be funny. But he isn\u2019t a brilliant comic known for extended riffing. Larry Charles, who cut his teeth on Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm before directing the comedy masterpiece Borat, tosses Cage into the sea without a life preserver, or maybe allowed him to swim far out. Viewing Army of One is watching a man thrash and bellow as he slowly drowns. Cage\u2019s version of Faulkner is a nails on a chalkboard experience. His accent is a mix of Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man and Jerry Lewis, with a little of that weird faux-southern thing John Travolta does in disasters like The Taking of Pelham 123. What\u2019s amazing is that the real Faulkner doesn\u2019t even talk like this! This fabricated, far-fetched and absurd nasal whine is an artistic choice. One has to go back to John Leguizamo in The Pest to find a performance more annoying. Who could possibly go toe-to-toe with a bearded Nicolas Cage mugging and prancing in extended, meandering scenes? Twelve minutes in, we meet Russell Brand as God. When Cage shouts \u201choly shit\u201d Brand winks in the camera and adds \u201cI take a holy shit every day!\u201d Larry Charles has been in writers rooms with some of the most clever creative minds of our time. I can only think he allowed this moment in the final edit at gunpoint. Every other scene is just as bad, as are the cheapo music cues that sound like temp tracks from a freeware program that somebody forgot to replace. Anyway, God tells Faulkner to find Osama bin Laden (who Faulkner calls \u201cBinny Boy\u201d) and the first step is to go to a casino to win travel money. There are a few moments of casual racism with Mexicans, and not the \u201cpunching up\u201d kind found in Borat. Faulkner is an America First type, and in a real movie this would be an avenue for exploration. Army of One fails on such a critical level that it never establishes how we are supposed to feel about our lead character. Are we rooting for his quixotic adventure, or feeling sorry for his inner turmoil? I can tell you one thing, we\u2019re not laughing. We are cringing and texting our friends about the next atrocity in each scene. After trying to sail from California to Pakistan, Faulkner goes to Israel in the hopes of hang-gliding there. Past the halfway mark of the movie he goes the traditional route and flies to Islamabad. Things go from annoying to boring, as there\u2019s an inherent problem in telling this story as a goose-chase comedy. Once Faulkner gets to Pakistan, nothing really happens. We\u2019re treated to Cage screaming and carrying on (and more casual racism, this time a gag about \u201ca disagreement over one of his wives and a goat\u201d) but we\u2019re left wondering just when the damn thing is going to start. There\u2019s also a ludicrous love story crammed in, wherein the extremely talented Wendi McLendon-Covey has nothing to do but look supportive in a tank top. I hope she made enough money on this movie to buy a small lake house \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t have On Demand services so she won\u2019t be reminded of this film. Comedy is subjective, and when it comes to broad farces I am more forgiving than most. I am the critic who gave Hot Pursuit three stars and still stand by that, even though I am no longer permitted to dine in certain restaurants as a result. But Army of One isn\u2019t a film, it is a traffic accident, and even though it is the worst thing I\u2019ve seen in 2016, I know I won\u2019t stop talking about it for weeks. Army of One is now available to watch digitally in the US"
"14||Doreen Spooner recalls her time as a photographer on Testosterone AlleyThe Daily Mirror was famous for promoting women journalists, such as Marje Proops and Felicity Green. Less well known, but just as significant, was Doreen Spooner, reputed to be the first female photographer to have a staff job on a popular paper. Now 88, and almost 30 years after retiring from the Mirror, she has just written her autobiography, Camera Girl (an ironic choice of title, as will become clear).* She tells of her various assignments, which included a variety of hard news stories, features portraits and fashion shoots. Spooner was as much at home taking pictures in Northern Ireland during the troubles as she was snapping scantily clad models in the studio. Newspapers were in her blood: her father, Len, was art editor of the Daily Herald. After a college course and a brief spell with a photo agency, she joined the Mirror in 1949 and soon after won an award for her portrait of playwright George Bernard Shaw at his garden gate. She left to freelance, first in America and then in Paris. She met and married another photographer, Pierre Vandeputte-Manevy, had three children and returned to London in the late 1950s. Marital difficulties, exacerbated by financial problems, persuaded Spooner to go back to work and she regained her Mirror position. It was in the summer of 1963, during the Profumo affair, that she landed her first front page scoop, a candid shot of Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies in a pub before they gave evidence in the trial of Stephen Ward. She managed to get off just one shot before she realised the landlord had spotted her. Before he approached, she removed the film and hid it inside her coat. \u201cI knew in my gut I\u2019d got it,\u201d she told the Sunday Mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to take photos \u2013 but so much harder to get \u2018the picture\u2019, the image that somehow captures the essence of the people in the frame. \u201cBut right there in my lens I\u2019d seen it \u2013 Christine Keeler, eyes down, fragile, and Mandy Rice-Davies looking straight ahead in a cocky blonde beehive. I\u2019d got the contrast of personalities\u201d. Spooner was also relieved that the byline no longer said, as it had when she first joined the paper, \u201cby Camera Girl Doreen Spooner\u201d. She said: \u201cThat was a bloody cheek. I think they thought it endearing, but I wasn\u2019t having it\u201d. She also talked of male-dominated Fleet Street being \u201cTestosterone Alley\u201d, saying \u201cI like to think I played a small part in changing attitudes \u2013 never waving a feminist flag, just by getting on with my job... \u201cThe excitement was intoxicating. I loved the buzz involved in creating a paper and getting it out to every corner of Britain\u201d. Among those jobs was coverage of the miners\u2019 strike, the Greenham Common protests and the Zeebrugge disaster in 1987 when the car ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, capsized, killing 193 people. Spooner took pictures of \u201cpoor traumatised people, lying in their hospital beds, poleaxed by the horror that had befallen them\u201d. She is, naturally enough, happier to recall less stressful assignments in which she took photos of celebrities. Some, however, were anything but helpful subjects. Albert Einstein, for instance, \u201cwasn\u2019t a happy bunny\u201d, and Sophia Loren \u201cnever cracked a smile\u201d, although she looked beautiful all the same. Several examples of her portfolio can be found here on the Mirror site and also on the BBC website, which includes a superb portrait of composer Leonard Bernstein. Spooner did a great deal of studio work too. According to William Boot, who may not have been the most reliable of sources, a female model once remarked: \u201cYou never mind getting your kit off for Doreen. It\u2019s like undressing in front of your granny\u201d. *Camera Girl by Doreen Spooner with Alan Clark (Mirror Books) can be ordered here, with free delivery."
"1||Tory MP resigns over government approach to Brexit \u2013 as it happenedHere\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: A Conservative MP who has resigned after criticising Theresa May\u2019s handling of the Brexit process has told friends that the Tory party has become \u201cUkip-lite\u201d. Stephen Phillips, who voted for Britain to leave the EU, blamed \u201csignificant policy differences\u201d between himself and the government for his decision to quit as MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, in Lincolnshire. Last month Phillips told the Guardian he was angry about the way the government was handling Brexit. In an article for the paper he wrote: \u201cNot giving parliament the chance, before article 50 is invoked, to say where it thinks these negotiations should end up is, at its core, undemocratic, unconstitutional and likely to exacerbate the divisions in our society to which the referendum gave rise.\u201d There has been mounting speculation that Phillips\u2019 resignation will prompt an early election. But Downing Street said the PM\u2019s position that there should not be a general election before 2020 remained unchanged. Theresa May has reassured Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker that she is determined to stick to her timetable of triggering article 50 to leave the EU by the end of March, despite the ruling.\u201cShe confirmed that the timetable remains the same,\u201d a spokesman said Foreign secretary Boris Johnson has urged Europe to ignore \u201csturm und drang\u201d in parliament over the high court ruling. Speaking in Berlin after meeting his German counterpart Johnson also insisted that the ruling would not interfere with the timetable for triggering article 50. There is widespread alarm about press hostility to the judges who ruled that parliament should trigger article 50. LibDem leader Tim Farron said today\u2019s front pages are as \u201cdepressing as they are irresponsible\u201d. Labour called on justice secretary Liz Truss to condemn \u201chysterical\u201d attacks on the judiciary. Brendan Cox, the husband of the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, tweeted that \u201cinciting hatred has consequences\u201d. A narrow majority now wants the UK to remain in the EU, according to a new poll by BMG. It found that 45% now back remain compared to 43% for leave, with 12% saying they don\u2019t know. Ukip leadership candidate Suzanne Evans has announced that she is seeking the party\u2019s nomination for the Sleaford byelection. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One: \u201cI would like to throw my hat into the ring.\u201d One of the other contenders to replace Nigel Farage as leader of Ukip has pulled out of the race. London assembly member Peter Whittle declared he was withdrawing his candidacy and offering his support to the frontrunner Paul Nuttall. Germany has urged Britain to set out its negotiation position over Brexit as soon as possible. Speaking alongside his counterpart Boris Johnson, Germany\u2019s foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said: \u201cBrexit is the clear and unmistakable position of your government. We regret that but of course we respect this decision.\u201d He added: \u201cwe should create the conditions as soon as possible for the negotiations to begin,\u201d even if Britain\u2019s Parliament does need a say. \u201cA stalemate won\u2019t do either side any good,\u201d he added. The Welsh government decision to take part in the supreme court hearing on a parliamentary vote on article 50 has sharply increased the prospects that Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s Scottish government could also join the legal action, writes Severin Carrell. Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has been poised to seek formal representation in the action if Holyrood\u2019s ability to give legislative consent to the final Brexit deal becomes part of the legal arguments in next month\u2019s hearing. She told the Scottish parliament yesterday she would actively consider joining the case: \u201cThe job of this government is to protect Scotland\u2019s interests; Scotland voted to remain in the EU and my job is therefore to protect our place in Europe and the single market as far as I possibly can.\u201d This is a contentious area: Theresa May\u2019s UK government argues that leaving the EU is wholly reserved to Westminster as it deals with foreign affairs and treaties. Scottish and now Welsh ministers argue that their devolved powers are directly affected by leaving the EU. Sturgeon has stopped short of stating Holyrood will try to block Brexit by withholding legislative consent but insists that Scotland\u2019s specific interests are intimately wrapped up in the Brexit deal. Her officials admit that legislative consent is a convention, not a legal right. Scottish government lawyers have already been sitting in on the high court hearings as observers in case that became an issue. Scottish sources said the statement on Friday by Mick Antoniw, the counsel general for Wales, now made a live prospect. Antoniw said the article 50 hearing \u201craise[s] issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of Parliamentary Sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom and the legal framework for devolution.\u201d A friend of Phillips said he has resigned because the Conservatives have become \u201cUkip lite\u201d, writes Rajeev Syal. \u201cIt\u2019s about values. The values of this government are not his values. \u201cThey\u2019ve lurched to the right and become UKIP lite. He is not,\u201d the friend said. \u201cTheir failure to honour their promises on child refugees; the decimation of international aid to the poorest and most vulnerable in the world\u201d are two of the key issues, the friend said. \u201cBrexit is part of it, because they think they can do what the hell they like without asking parliament. But it\u2019s only a small part of it. It\u2019s the fact that he is not a Conservative in this mould,\u201d the friend added. Here\u2019s video of EU commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva failing to suppress a smile as she described the \u201cfairly short conversation\u201d between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker over the timing for triggering article 50 in the wake of yesterday\u2019s ruling. The Bar Council has added to the growing chorus of those condemning the hostile media coverage of the judges involved in Thursday\u2019s ruling. Chantal-Aim\u00e9e Doerries chairman of the Bar Council said: \u201cIf we do not respect the independent judiciary we put at risk our democracy. All the parties in the case accepted that it was right that the judges should determine this issue.\u201d Speaking to BBC News she said: \u201cWhat concerns me about the headlines is the attack on judges and the attack effectively on their role, in other words not recognising that they are independent in upholding the rule of law, not simply expressing their own views.\u201d Ukip leadership candidate Suzanne Evans has announced that she is seeking the party\u2019s nomination for the Sleaford byelection. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One: \u201cI would like to throw my hat into the ring.\u201d Evans is one of three remaining contenders to replace Nigel Farage as leader of Ukip. Steven Morris has more on the response of the Welsh government to the high court ruling and subsequent challenge (see earlier). The first reaction of the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, to the Brexit high court judgement was to urge the UK government not to challenge the ruling. It was not that he thought the ruling could scupper Brexit \u2013 which he opposed. Jones said there was no doubt in his mind that the UK would leave the EU. But he argued that debating the terms of Brexit in parliament would help the people of the whole of the UK to understand the strategy of Theresa May\u2019s government. He also repeated \u2013 for the umpteenth time since the referendum \u2013 that votes should take place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to endorse the UK government\u2019s position. But it was inevitable that there would be a supreme court hearing. Having considered overnight, the counsel general for Wales, Mick Antoniw, the government\u2019s law officer, has said he wishes to attend that hearing \u2013 and address the judges. Antoniw, an assembly member for Pontypridd, is concerned at how the UK government had hoped to use prerogative powers to trigger article 50 without consulting MPs and peers \u2013 and believes this could have \u201cprofound\u201d implications for the relationship between Westminster and the devolved assemblies. A fear is that future use of those powers may undermine the status of the Welsh assembly and the fundamental legal and constitutional relationships of the Welsh government to the UK government. There has been some concern that Wales will find it hard to get its voice heard during the build-up to Brexit. Antoniw\u2019s appearance at the supreme court, if it is allowed, will help build Wales\u2019 profile. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has urged Europe to ignore \u201csturm und drang\u201d (storm and stress) in parliament over the high court ruling. Asked about Phillips\u2019 resignation during at a press conference in Berlin with his German counterpart, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Johnson said: He should really not read too much into the legal decision that you have just seen or indeed the sturm und drang, if that\u2019s the word I want, that is going on in parliament at the moment. The direction is very clear the will of the British people was expressed very clearly and it is the decision of Theresa May and her government to get on and make that process work. And that is what is going to happen. It is very important for our European friends and partners ... to get on with delivering a solution that works for both our great economies. Johnson also insisted that the ruling would not interfere with the timetable for triggering article 50. Owen Bowcott has more on the political reaction to the press hostility over the high court ruling. Brendan Cox, the husband of the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, has added his voice to those condemning press hostility to the high court\u2019s ruling. In a tweet he pointed out that \u201cinciting hatred has consequences\u201d. Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far today: Conservative MP Stephn Phillips, who voted to leave the EU but has criticised Theresa May for failing to include parliament in the process has resigned. He blamed \u201csignificant policy differences\u201d between himself and the government, as he announced he was quitting as MP for Sleaford and North Hyekham, in Lincolnshire. Phillips told the Guardian he was angry about the way the government was handling Brexit. In an article for the paper he wrote: \u201cNot giving parliament the chance, before article 50 is invoked, to say where it thinks these negotiations should end up is, at its core, undemocratic, unconstitutional and likely to exacerbate the divisions in our society to which the referendum gave rise.\u201d There has been mounting speculation that Phillips\u2019 resignation will prompt an early election. But Downing Street said the PM\u2019s position that there should not be a general election before 2020 remained unchanged. Theresa May has told the president of the European commission Jean-Claude Juncker and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel of her determination to stick triggering article 50 by the end of March. She also expressed her disappointment at Thursday\u2019s ruling. There is widespread alarm at how the press has covered the high court ruling. LibDem leader Tim Farron said today\u2019s front pages are as \u201cdepressing as they are irresponsible\u201d. Labour called on justice secretary Liz Truss to condemn \u201chysterical\u201d attacks on the judiciary. A narrow majority now want the UK to remain in the EU, according to a new poll by BMG.

London assembly member Peter Whittle declared he was withdrawing his candidacy and offering his support to the frontrunner Paul Nuttall. Lawyers for Gina Miller, one of those who successfully challenged the government on parliament\u2019s right to trigger article 50, are not commenting on whether she plans to make a complaint to the police about death threats in the wake of Thursday\u2019s ruling. A spokesman for Mischon de Raya said: \u201cWe are not commenting on whether any complaints have been made to the police. But I can confirm that both Mischon and Gina have received some abuse.\u201d There have been online calls for Miller to be publicly hanged and for a price to be put on her head. The Metropolitan Police said it could not comment until a complaint had been made. Since you\u2019re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever \u2013 but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian\u2019s journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe that independent reporting and plurality of voices matter. If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future would be much more secure. Get closer to our journalism and be part of our story by becoming a Supporter. Or, alternatively, make a one-time contribution. - Guardian HQ. There\u2019s been a sharp spike in traffic to an article Stephen Phillips wrote for the Guardian last month. It explains why he has \u201cirreconcilable policy differences with the current government\u201d. The campaign to give parliament the right to determine our future relationship with the EU is not about reversing the referendum result. Nor is it about subverting the will of the British people, or having a second bite of the cherry. It\u2019s about the sovereignty that I and others cherish, a sovereignty that resides principally in the House of Commons and in its ability, when given the opportunity, to inform and direct the government of the day. Not giving parliament the chance, before article 50 is invoked, to say where it thinks these negotiations should end up is, at its core, undemocratic, unconstitutional and likely to exacerbate the divisions in our society to which the referendum gave rise. It also ignores the views of nearly half the people who voted in the referendum, who were perfectly content with our place in the EU. Ignoring them, even though they were (just) in the minority, is not merely divisive but plain wrong. No hint yet from Downing Street on any early general election ... A No 10 source said Stehpen Phillips did not speak to May before resigning and that the PM\u2019s position that there should not be a general election before 2020 remained unchanged. PA has more on May\u2019s Brexit diplomacy and the government determination to appeal against the article 50 ruling. As well as her talks with Juncker, the prime minister also called German chancellor Angela Merkel and is expected to speak to other European leaders later in an effort to reassure them that her Brexit plans remain on track. Downing Street said it did not accept the High Court judgment and was \u201cconfident\u201d of victory in the Supreme Court. A Number 10 spokesman said May explained to Juncker and the German leader that \u201cwhile the government is disappointed by the judgment yesterday, we remain of the firm belief that we have strong legal arguments ahead of the case which will be moving to the Supreme Court next month\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister also confirmed that the planned timetable for notification of article 50 remains the same,\u201d the spokesman added. Downing Street refused to say whether legislation was already being drawn up for triggering article 50 in case the Supreme Court upheld the ruling, stressing that it was focused on winning the case. Asked if May agreed with Cabinet minister Sajid Javid that the judgment was \u201cunacceptable\u201d, the spokesman said: \u201cThe very fact that we are appealing that decision means very clearly that we don\u2019t accept that decision.\u201d Labour is calling on justice secretary Liz Truss to condemn \u201chysterical\u201d attacks on the judiciary in the press. Labour shadow justice minister Richard Burgon said headlines in some of today\u2019s papers were unacceptable and urged Truss to uphold the independence of the judiciary. Labour chairman of the Justice Select Committee Bob Neill tweeted that personal attacks on judges threatened the independence of the judiciary. The Conservative Party has expressed its sorrow over the resignation of Stephen Phillips. Theresa May has also called German Chancellor Angela Merkel to express her disappointment over the high court\u2019s decision, lobby correspondents have been told. Political analyst Mike Smithson does the maths on May\u2019s dwindling parliamentary majority as speculation mounts about an early general election. Phillips secured a majority of more than 24,000 over Labour in the Sleaford and North Hykeham seat at the last election. It was also one of the most pro-Brexit constituencies in the country. Meanwhile, Theresa May has made that call to Juncker about the timing of triggering article 50 still being on track. It was a short call, according to the commission. Phillips said he was resigning because of \u201cirreconcilable policy differences with the current government\u201d. Phillips has now resigned from his Sleaford and North Hykeham seat with \u201cimmediate effect\u201d. There is widespread speculation that Tory MP Stephen Phillips is about to resign over the government\u2019s reaction to the high court ruling. The Welsh government has announced it is to back the complainants against the UK government during next month\u2019s supreme court appeal against Thursday\u2019s high court ruling. In a statement Mick Antoniw, Counsel General for Wales Having considered the judgments in both matters, I consider that they raise issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of Parliamentary Sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom and the legal framework for devolution. They raise questions about the use of the prerogative power to take steps which will or may impact on: Therefore, in accordance with my power under section 67 of the Government of Wales Act 2006, I intend to make an application to be granted permission to intervene in the proposed appeal before the Supreme Court. My intention is to make representations about the specific implications of the government\u2019s proposed decision for Wales. The Scottish government is considering a similar move. The legal ruling may complicate the UK leaving the EU, but the referendum result was clear. And woe betide the MP or peer who stands in the way of it, warns Simon Jenkins. There\u2019s even been a call for military coup to enforce Brexit. Hard Brexiteer Jon Redwood MP has suggested the wording for an article 50 motion (rather than a bill). In a blog post he writes: I hope the government will now table a motion saying \u201cThis House approves the sending of an Article 50 letter in accordance with the wishes of the people as expressed in the referendum, any judgement of the courts notwithstanding\u201d The government should then send the letter. I would expect the motion to pass easily, as I cannot believe Labour will impose a 3 line whip to expressly go against the results of the referendum. If they did the government should still win the vote, given Labour rebels, some Northern Ireland MPs and most Conservatives voting for. A number of Labour MPs have insisted they won\u2019t block the referendum results but that they want the article 50 bill to include amendments setting out more details about what Brexit will entail. Shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook tweeted that the vote should be about the terms of Brexit not whether the UK leaves the EU. Other Labour MPs have put out similar statements. A narrow majority now want the UK to remain in the EU, according to a new poll by BMG. It found that 45% now back remain compared to 43% for leave, with 12% saying they don\u2019t know. There is widespread alarm at how the press has covered the high court ruling. LibDem leader Tim Farron commented: \u201cThe hyperbolic front pages from some of the more right wing newspapers today are as depressing as they are irresponsible. Personalised attack on our independent judiciary is a dangerous path to go down, unjustifiable and cultivates a nasty, divisive discourse around this debate. \u201cThere can be no defence to plastering photographs of judges across the front pages of news stands like some depressive modern day version of a wild west poster. \u201cPeople need to take a step back, think more carefully about the language they are using and let our judges do their job. There is an irony that the same newspapers that argued we would \u2018take back control\u2019 are now complaining that the British people will have their views represented through the British parliament.\u201d The SNP\u2019s Richard Lochhead an MSP for Moray noted that even the rule of law is being attacked by the press. The treatment of Gina Miller, one of those who brought the case, is also causing concern. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott notes that Miller has been subjected to death threats online. Another Ukip leadership contender has pulled out of the race. London Assembly member Peter Whittle announced his withdraw and backing for the favourite Paul Nuttall, the party\u2019s former deputy leader. In a Facebook post, Whittle wrote: To meet the new challenges which the future holds, UKIP needs a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty of members across the board. So after a great deal of thought, I have decided to withdraw from the leadership contest and recommend wholeheartedly that members vote for Paul Nuttall. I would like to thank those members and supporters who planned to support me, but I have become convinced that the sheer breadth of Paul\u2019s political experience, his dedication to the values of the party and the obvious affection in which he is held by members make him the person who is best placed to take us forward. Ukip\u2019s leadership contest is now down to a choice of three: Nuttall, Suzanne Evans, and John Rees-Evans. Or as BuzzFeed\u2019s Jim Waterson put it: \u201cIt\u2019s Nutall v Suzanne Evans v gay donkey man\u201d. Reactions to the ruling and its coverage are still coming in from MPs on social media. The former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has said the Liberal Democrats will press for amendments to the article 50 bill to ensure that ministers pursue a soft Brexit and guarantee that the public have a say on the final deal. He told Today that as the government had failed to spell out what Brexit means, \u201cparliament now needs to help the government fill in the gaps\u201d. A bill will be presented to parliament which can of course, like all legislation, be amended. We will seek, with other parties, in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords to amend the legislation, such that parliament would say to government that it should pursue a soft Brexit, not a hard Brexit and that there should be some means by which the British people can have a say on the final deal when the negotiations with the European Union are finally completed. Peers in the House of Lords will pursue exactly the same approach. Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary and a prominent leave supporter, said the government should resist such amendments: Parliament cannot expect the government to set out its negotiating hand because that would not be in the national interest, nor should it constrain the flexibility of the government to negotiate on our behalf to get the best deal. Douglas Carswell, Ukip\u2019s only MP, has insisted that Brexit is going to happen \u2013 even if it takes another general election. In a blogpost this morning he writes: I receive a lot of angry emails from my constituents about these naked attempts to reverse the referendum result. The more obstructionism we see, the harder it is to reassure them that their votes won\u2019t be subverted. If the prime minister has to call an election on article 50, so be it. Given that she has an 18 point lead in the polls, I doubt she\u2019s quaking at the prospect. But obstructionist remainers should think very carefully about what that election will be like. So the main story today is that the prime minister is due to telephone Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, to say she still plans to trigger article 50 by the end of March. But senior Tories have welcomed the high court ruling as a boost to parliamentary sovereignty and signalled that it may delay the process. The Conservative peer Lady Patience Wheatcroft told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme it would be impossible to trigger article 50 by the end of March: I think it is only right to delay triggering article 50 until we have a clearer idea of what it actually entails. And I think there will be others in the Lords who feel the same way. How many I think it is hard to say, but I think there could be a majority who would be in favour of delaying article 50 until we know a little more about what lies ahead. The communities secretary, Sajid Javid, said the ruling was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Speaking on BBC Question Time, he said the decision was \u201can attempt to frustrate the will of the British people\u201d. But Jesse Norman, a junior minister in the Department of Industry, appeared to welcome the ruling by tweeting that it was \u201ca reminder that we live in a parliamentary and not a popular democracy\u201d. Here are a few Guardian articles on yesterday\u2019s ruling which are worth reading for further information and analysis. First, we have an interview with Gina Miller, the businesswoman at the centre of the legal challenge against the government. Miller says the landmark case was motivated by her fear that the UK faced a \u201ctreacherous future\u201d, and admits she knew the ruling would leave her unpopular with many voters. She has been exposed to vitriol and even death threats because of her challenge. The Guardian\u2019s political editor Heather Stewart warns remainers not to let the high court decision raise their hopes. She says Brexit itself was not on trial \u2013 but Theresa May\u2019s bullish approach to it, and ultimately her political judgment. Martin Kettle writes that after this ruling, MPs must seize their moment. In many respects it is to parliament\u2019s discredit that it has done so little to force the issue and protect its rights, he says. And check out our report on Nicola Sturgeon saying the Scottish government will \u201cactively consider\u201d whether it will formally join in the next legal battle. Last night, a portion of the British media, unhappy with the high court\u2019s decision, ran front pages attacking the judges behind the ruling. The Daily Mail called them \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. The Express said the country \u201cfaces a crisis as grave as anything since the dark days when Churchill vowed we would fight them on the beaches\u201d. The Sun, meanwhile, took a swipe at the \u201cloaded foreign elite\u201d who have defied the will of the British people. Slightly over the top? As they say in court, the jury\u2019s out \u2026 For a period, the Mail online also ran this headline: The Telegraph opted for a double whammy of evil blue filter and accompanying opinion piece by the Brexit king of Britain: The campaign to Stop Funding Hate is now calling out advertisers featured in this specific edition of the Daily Mail. The Criminal Bar Association said the papers\u2019 reaction was an attack on the rule of law. And to add fuel to fire, those pesky experts are at it again \u2026 Good morning and welcome to our daily politics live blog. Andy Sparrow is off today, so my colleagues and I will be keeping you up to date with all the latest developments in the government\u2019s fight to trigger article 50 by the end of March. Yesterday, Theresa May suffered a massive setback in what was the most important development in the Brexit story since her election as prime minister, after a high court ruled that parliament should legislate on invoking article 50. That means there needs to be a proper bill, passed through the Commons and the Lords, with MPs given a chance to amend it. Up until now, May has refused to give parliament a vote on the terms of Brexit in order to retain as much control as possible. To jog your memory of A-level politics, power in a democratic state such as Britain is conventionally shared by three bodies: the executive, which rules and proposes laws; the legislature, which passes laws; and the judiciary, which determines whether laws are being obeyed. Yesterday\u2019s landmark ruling means MPs and peers have for the first time got a strong chance of shaping the start of the Brexit process. Some key things that you need to know: The government plans to appeal against the ruling, but informed commentators believe it is likely to lose again. The chances of Brexit being overturned are still minimal, as most MPs and peers who voted to remain accept that the result of the referendum should be honoured. The chances of a soft Brexit have increased significantly. If there is a bill, parliament will have the chance to exercise leverage. There is a real possibility that May will not be able to trigger article 50 before the end of March, as the need to legislate could cause a delay. We are more likely to see an early general election than we were this time yesterday - a vote some commentators have dubbed \u201cthe Brexit election\u201d. Today, the prime minister is due to speak to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and tell him that she is going to press ahead with her plan to trigger article 50 by the end of March. If you\u2019ve seen anything you think we ought to cover, I\u2019ll be reading your comments below the line, or you can reach me on Twitter @nadiakhomami."
"31||Judges' actions around the world show they are no enemy of the peopleThe three judges who ruled that the UK government would have to pass an act of parliament before it could trigger article 50 to leave the EU have come in for intense criticism domestically. But in examples from around the world this week, the judiciary has been on the frontline in the defence of freedom. Far from being seen as the enemy of the people, judges are often viewed as their most trusted allies. An independent judiciary can be a last bulwark against corruption, press censorship and an overweening executive, whereas a weakened judiciary subjected to political influence gives governments a free hand. In Hong Kong, for instance, many people hope the judiciary will help their fight against Beijing\u2019s growing encroachment on the city\u2019s autonomy. A judge there will shortly rule on whether two young pro-democracy politicians who have refused to swear an oath of allegiance to Chinese rule can be recognised as legislators. The judgment will determine the independence of the legislature, assuming the Chinese government does not in effect overrule the courts. In South Africa, a country still learning to love its constitution, high court judges and the former public protector Thuli Madonsela have played a key role in exposing corruption allegations against the president, Jacob Zuma, and the ruling ANC party. This week Zuma dropped his opposition to the publication of a report by Madonsela that recommends a commission of inquiry headed by a judge be set up within 30 days to investigate alleged influence peddling in government. Similarly, in Zimbabwe, independent judges have repeatedly challenged Robert Mugabe\u2019s efforts to ban public demonstrations. In Brazil a federal judge, S\u00e9rgio Moro, could topple the recently installed president, Michel Temer. Moro has become the public face of the battle to uncover corruption across Brazil. He ordered the arrest of four members of the senate\u2019s own internal police force, who have been accused of obstructing an investigation into the Petrobras scandal. In India, journalists and media organisations are asking judges to intervene after the government was accused of censorship reminiscent of the country\u2019s 1970s emergency. A network was ordered off the air over its reporting of an attack by Pakistan-based militants. In an example of the dangers of a non-independent judiciary, Venezuela\u2019s supreme court, which is controlled by government sympathisers, this week allowed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to remove budgetary authority from the congress, the country\u2019s main source of political opposition. And in Turkey, where opposition MPs were arrested early on Friday, the chances of judges intervening are slim. A law passed this year has gutted the bulk of the judiciary. A total of 3,700 judges have been arrested or prosecuted. MPs have lost their immunity from prosecution and press censorship has been imposed. Meanwhile, the rightwing attack on the British judiciary comes at a time when the role of Britain as an international legal beacon is under pressure. Theresa May in her brief leadership campaign may have shelved plans to remove Britain from the European convention on human rights and introduce a British bill. But the persistence of the attack on the ECHR by ministers has had an impact. Equally, the government has removed a reference in the ministerial code to the requirement that ministers comply with international law. The government said it was merely an innocent tidying-up process, but it comes at a time when the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, frequently makes reference to plans to bring Russian or Syrian perpetrators of war crimes to justice in international courts. Moreover, the current attorney general, Jeremy Wright, like his predecessor, Dominic Grieve, underlines \u201cthe intense public scrutiny that the UK\u2019s government actions attract on the world stage and the importance of international law to both frame and defend those actions.\u201d With African nations from South Africa to Gambia rushing to leave the international criminal court, it is arguably even more important that British ministers, starting with the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, speak out to defend the rule of law, as is their statutory duty, rather than through silence connive in judicial intimidation. For all its faults, the UK judiciary is seen as fair and predictable. It is the international gold standard, and one of the key sources of the UK\u2019s soft power."

"22||The great 'poppy war': how did we get here?Is this year\u2019s poppy row anything new? Well, no. It has become a strange seasonal harbinger that some sort of argument about the wearing of paper flowers will break out as we prepare to remember millions of fallen soldiers. This time, Fifa has refused to bend its ban on the display of political symbols on kits for the England and Scotland teams, whose World Cup qualifier next Friday falls on Armistice Day. Wales also want to wear poppies for their tie against Serbia the next day. Theresa May called the ban \u201cutterly outrageous\u201d. Rules are rules, Fifa said. The teams now plan to ignore them and wear poppies on black armbands. Have British teams always worn poppies at this time of year? No, although this is a rematch of sorts. In 2011, Fifa threatened to stop play if England wore embroidered poppies for a friendly against Spain. Prince William gave royal assent to the outrage and an armband compromise was agreed, creating a precedent, poppy champions now argue. But in previous England matches at this time of year, against Sweden in 2001 and Yugoslavia in 1987, there were no poppies or outrage. In 1946, England played Wales on 12 November, a little over a year after the end of the second world war, in which several top-flight footballers had been killed. There were no poppies, and no fuss about it. So what has changed? Somehow a voluntary, individual act of remembrance has become an obligation and test of patriotism for public figures. Conscientious objectors and thwarters, be they newsreaders or sports governing bodies, can expect to be attacked. Ten years ago, Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow described an \u201cunpleasant breed of poppy fascism\u201d (beyond his socks, he won\u2019t wear anything that makes a statement on air, he said). The angriest poppy purists have framed the argument as a war, of all things. (\u201cPOPPY WAR!\u201d the Daily Mail front page cried on Thursday.) When did poppies become so political? Very soon after the origins of what might feel like a British tradition. After the first world war, Moina Michael, an American academic in France, was moved to make silk poppies by In Flanders Fields, the poem by the Canadian doctor and soldier John McCrae (\u201cIn Flanders fields the poppies blow, Between the crosses, row on row \u2026\u201d). Michael in turn inspired a Frenchwoman, Anna Gu\u00e9rin, to mass-produce poppies and sell them in America in 1920. Gu\u00e9rin persuaded Field Marshal Haig, founder of the Royal British Legion, to launch the first \u201cPoppy day\u201d appeal in Britain in 1921. This year the charity plans to distribute 45m poppies. Yet controversy has clung like aphids to the little flowers for decades. In 1926, the No More War movement, founded in 1921, proposed a white poppy as an alternative or companion to the red flower, which many pacifists felt glorified war. They also called for the addition of the words \u201cno more war\u201d at the centre of the red poppy. It did not happen, but the movement later rolled into the Peace Pledge Union, which in 1936 began making white poppies. The movement reflected and fuelled simmering tension and debate about the legacy of war, the effects of the Great Depression, the nature of patriotism \u2013 and the rise of Hitler. Red poppies remain political in many parts of the world. Many Irish nationalists regard them as symbols of British militarism. In 2014, the Irish footballer James McClean declined to wear one on his shirt when he played for Wigan. Doing so would \u201cbe seen as an act of disrespect to my people\u201d, he said, referring to Bloody Sunday. McClean was booed by some fans, and received a death threat in 2012 when he made the same decision at Sunderland. What does the Royal British Legion say? It insists poppies are not political. \u201cWearing a poppy is a personal choice,\u201d it adds. \u201cIt is not compulsory, but is greatly appreciated by those it helps.\u201d Despite assumptions to the contrary, the BBC shares this pro-choice approach, at least at home. While the corporation asks its international presenters not to wear poppies because they are not universally recognised, domestic presenters can go either way. It\u2019s a symbol of the conformity required after decades of debate that none demur. As David Jordan, the BBC\u2019s editorial policy chief, wrote in 2006, while there is no rule, \u201cthere is clearly the potential that not wearing one might cause some controversy\u201d."
"0||Alexei Volodin review \u2013 majestic but lacking in subtletyIt\u2019s quite a challenge to come up with a programme for a piano recital with a Shakespearean theme, but Alexei Volodin managed it, for the first half of his Wigmore Hall concert at least. In fact just one of the works he\u2019d chosen was originally intended for piano \u2013 one of Nikolay Medtner\u2019s 34 Skazki (Fairytales). They are miniatures that portray inner dramas, and the C-sharp minor piece that Volodin played, the fourth of the Op 35 set, is prefaced by a famous quote from King Lear: \u201cBlow, wind, and crack thy cheeks.\u201d In fact that turbulent, unrelenting piece showed Volodin at his best, for he seems to belong to the school of Russian-trained players who believe that the faster and louder a piece is played the better. There weren\u2019t many real pianissimos during the evening, and not much in the way of subtle textural effects either. The 10 pieces from Prokofiev\u2019s ballet Romeo and Juliet did better on menace than they did on charm, even in the numbers devoted to Juliet, while Rachmaninov\u2019s transcription of the scherzo from Mendelssohn\u2019s Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream music was taken just a fraction too fast to be cleanly articulated. Volodin followed this sequence with more Rachmaninov with a very different literary connection. The programme for the First Piano Sonata comes from Goethe\u2019s Faust, and it follows the scheme of Liszt\u2019s Faust Symphony, with each of the movements representing a portrait of one of the protagonists. Predictably, Volodin\u2019s performance was much more convincing in its outer-movement depictions of Faust and Mephistopheles than it was with the more introspective centrepiece, devoted to Gretchen, but the majesty that he conjured for the sonata\u2019s closing pages was certainly impressive."
"0||Laura Jurd/Dinosaur review \u2013 effortless fun from a band who continue to surpriseLaura Jurd always seems too immersed in the euphoria of music-making to be much tempted by irony, so the fact that her new band Dinosaur is the opposite of extinct maybe didn\u2019t occur to her. At Kings Place, the cheerfully diffident but implacably focused 25-year-old trumpeter and composer, along with her superb young quartet, invoked the spirit of their debut album\u2019s title \u2013 Together, As One \u2013 and the confident contemporary inventiveness of its journey across the jazz, folk and world music of the past four decades. The gig followed the album\u2019s tracklist, with one detour into the lyrically gliding Happy Sad Song, from Jurd\u2019s startling 2012 debut, Landing Ground. The spacey keyboard electronics that contrast so tellingly with the leader\u2019s clean, unbugged trumpet immediately featured on Awakening, as pianist Elliot Galvin\u2019s liquid Fender Rhodes swooped against Conor Chaplin\u2019s high-pitched bass guitar vamp, drummer Corrie Dick\u2019s quietly clapping pulse, and then Jurd\u2019s terse yet tonally gleaming short phrases. Zigzags between a folk-dance frolic, brittle short-note edginess and languidly porous melody on Robin displayed this band\u2019s effortless idiom-swapping with commendable coherence, and on the lamenting Living, Breathing, Jurd\u2019s silvery high-register sound floated imperturbably over a swelling, Bitches Brew-like funk groove from Galvin\u2019s keys. Following the tender theme of Happy Sad Song, Jurd began stretching her characteristically short, sharp-accented figures into poised long lines over a restless rhythmic flux. Extinct, a Dinosaur standout, set her yelping softly over Dick\u2019s remorseless backbeat and triggered a wonderful break of squelching low chords and jagged ascents from Galvin, before a startling percussion solo of rubbed abstract sounds rising to booming kick-drum hits, hard tom-tom rattles and melodic cymbal-edge tones. Jurd\u2019s Interlude, a slowly blossoming meditation with Dinosaur\u2019s signature rhythm-section whimsy coming and going beneath it, closed a memorable gig \u2013 but one that also suggested this fine band has plenty more surprises in store. At the National Centre for Early Music, York, on 11 November. Box office: 01904 658 338. Then touring until March."
"5||'The FBI is Trumpland': anti-Clinton atmosphere spurred leaking, sources sayDeep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. Current and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey\u2019s July decision not to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. \u201cThe FBI is Trumpland,\u201d said one current agent. This atmosphere raises major questions about how Comey and the bureau he is slated to run for the next seven years can work with Clinton should she win the White House. The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is \u201cthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,\u201d and that \u201cthe reason why they\u2019re leaking is they\u2019re pro-Trump.\u201d The agent called the bureau \u201cTrumplandia\u201d, with some colleagues openly discussing voting for a GOP nominee who has garnered unprecedented condemnation from the party\u2019s national security wing and who has pledged to jail Clinton if elected. At the same time, other sources dispute the depth of support for Trump within the bureau, though they uniformly stated that Clinton is viewed highly unfavorably. \u201cThere are lots of people who don\u2019t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt. What you hear a lot is that it\u2019s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician,\u201d said a former FBI official. Sources who disputed the depth of Trump\u2019s internal support agreed that the FBI is now in parlous political territory. Justice department officials \u2013 another current target of FBI dissatisfaction \u2013 have said the bureau disregarded longstanding rules against perceived or actual electoral interference when Comey wrote to Congress to say it was reviewing newly discovered emails relating to Clinton\u2019s personal server. Comey\u2019s vague letter to Congress, promptly leaked by Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz, said the bureau would evaluate communications \u2013 subsequently identified as coming from a device used by disgraced ex-congressman Anthony Weiner, whose estranged wife Huma Abedin is a Clinton aide \u2013 for connections to the Clinton server. Comey\u2019s allies say he was placed in an impossible position after previously testifying to Congress it would take an extraordinary development for him to revisit the Clinton issue. Throughout the summer and fall, Trump has attacked the FBI as corrupt for not effectively ending Clinton\u2019s political career. A political firestorm erupted, with Comey and the bureau coming under withering criticism, including a rebuke on Wednesday from Barack Obama. Even some congressional Republicans, no friends to Clinton, have expressed discomfort with Comey\u2019s last-minute insertion of the bureau into the election. The relevance of the communications to the Clinton inquiry has yet to be established, as Comey issued his letter before obtaining a warrant to evaluate them. Clinton surrogates contend that Comey has issued innuendo rather than evidence, preventing them from mounting a public defense. Some feel Comey needs to address the criticism and provide reassurance that the bureau, with its wide-ranging investigative and surveillance powers, will comport itself in an apolitical manner. Yet since Friday, Comey has maintained his silence, even as both Clinton and Trump have called for the bureau to disclose more of what it knows. Leaks, however, have continued. Fox News reported on Wednesday that the FBI is intensifying an investigation into the Clinton Foundation over allegations \u2013 which both the foundation and the Clinton camp deny \u2013 it traded donations for access to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. The Wall Street Journal reported that justice department officials considered the allegations flimsy. The leaks have not exclusively cast aspersions on Clinton. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, is the subject of what is said to be a preliminary FBI inquiry into his business dealings in Russia. Manafort has denied any wrongdoing. The Daily Beast reported on Thursday on ties between Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and the FBI\u2019s New York field office, which reportedly pressed the FBI to revisit the Clinton server investigation after beginning an inquiry into Weiner\u2019s alleged sexual texting with a minor. The website reported that a former New York field office chief, highly critical of the non-indictment, runs a military charity that has received significant financial donations from Trump. Comey\u2019s decision to tell the public in July that he was effectively dropping the Clinton server issue angered some within the bureau, particularly given the background of tensions with the justice department over the Clinton issue. A significant complication is the appearance of a conflict of interest regarding Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, who met with Bill Clinton this summer ahead of Comey\u2019s announcement, which she acknowledged had \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over the inquiry. \u201cMany FBI agents were upset at the director, not because he didn\u2019t [recommend to] indict, but they believe he threw the FBI under the bus by taking the heat away from DoJ [Department of Justice],\u201d the former bureau official said. All this has compounded pressure on Comey, with little end in sight. Jim Wedick, who retired from the bureau in 2004 after 35 years, said that if Clinton is elected, she and Comey would probably find a way to work together out of a sense of pragmatism. He recalled both his own occasional clashes with federal prosecutors and Bill Clinton\u2019s uneasy relationship with his choice for FBI director, Louis Freeh. \u201cEach one will find a way to pick at the other. It\u2019s not going to be good and it\u2019s not going to be pretty. But they\u2019ll both have to work with each other,\u201d he said. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee, said: \u201cThe continued leadership failures at the FBI are another reminder we can\u2019t let intelligence agencies say \u2018trust us\u2019 and then give them a blank check to probe into Americans\u2019 lives. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve argued for years that Congress must create ironclad protections for Americans\u2019 security and privacy, we also need vigilant oversight of agencies that have the power to deprive citizens of their liberty or change the course of an election.\u201d The FBI would not comment for this story."
"21||Refuge by Volta, Manchester: \u2018It\u2019s a glamourpuss\u2019 \u2013 restaurant reviewThe Palace Hotel building has loomed over Manchester\u2019s Oxford Street since the 1890s, a glum, Gothic monument to late-Victorian commerce. There\u2019s no doubting the magnificence of the place: the former Refuge Assurance Company has soaring ceilings, ornate cupolas, acres of lugubrious, decorative tiling. But it always struck me as the hero of its own horror story, smelling for ever of ancient cabbage and gravy, and staffed by grey-skinned retainers in league with ghouls ready to pounce as you slept fitfully in your slightly mouldy bed. Brrr. But no more: the exterior is still as powerfully gloomy as ever, but inside a transformation has taken place. As part of a multimillion pound restoration of the whole site, a new restaurant and bar have been created. When I first heard that Luke Cowdrey and Justin Crawford, aka DJs The Unabombers and owners of West Didsbury\u2019s neighbourhood favourite Volta, were going into the Palace, I thought: nuh-huh. This felt wrong, all wrong. Their signature is small, friendly, slightly batty \u2013 no way would that work in this cavernous space. But I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong: it\u2019s a jaw-dropping, dazzling tour de force, from the glittering bar with its many on-tap ales and beers and truly fine cocktails, to the twinkling, fairylit Winter Garden. The Refuge is now less scary old crone and more dramatic, drop-dead glamourpuss. A vague echo of the Overlook Hotel from the Shining only adds to the vaguely spooky allure. Anyone who has eaten at the original will recognise the Volta style, careering all over the globe with decks in tow. They talk the local produce talk, but fling it about with the louchest abandon: South American ceviches, Middle Eastern mutabal, pak choi, chimichurri, preserved lemon \u2013 the whole polyglot shebang. Lamb shawarma, a Volta stalwart, brings a pile of meat with a massive thwack of flavour, some shreds pleasingly biltong-chewy, others moist and mutton-ripe, with a pool of harissa and thick, cooling yoghurt: no looker, but an appealing brute of a thing. Cooking fish for this size of operation is a brave move, but the kitchen nails it: whole sea bass is fragrant with lime, ginger and coriander, its belly pregnant with pine nuts, its cooking perfectly judged. A fat slab of flawless, crisp-skinned hake comes on a black \u201cdaal\u201d made not of lentils, but of black-eyed beans, all murky with masala and topped with shards of fresh ginger. Stout bruisers of salt cod croquettes are crisp outside and fluffy with emulsified fish and mash within, plus a properly pongy a\u00efoli flecked with parsley on the side. There are nods to the US: buttermilk chicken (not hugely crisp, but succulent, brined meat) comes with cast-iron pot of cornbread seething with fruity, fiery jalape\u00f1o butter. And pear and hazelnut tatin, its crisp edges tarred with caramelised fruit juices, is a clever rethinking of a classic, its deceptively soothing espresso custard a bullet straight to the cranium. Yes, there are teething issues: food seems to come from far, far away, occasionally turning up the wrong side of tepid; seasoning can be a little off. And there\u2019s a truly lamentable ice-cream sandwich: cookies should be gooey enough to almost cuddle the ice-cream, not dry and dusty. But to do what they\u2019re doing on this scale, and still score hit after hit, is quite the achievement. We\u2019re seated at probably the worst table in the house, marooned beside a glaringly lit service corridor whose door chills us with every swing. The fact that I still feel well disposed to the place is testament to what the guys (with Robbie Bargh from the estimable Gorgeous Group) have done here. I\u2019m even turning a blind eye to the fact that Cowdrey and Crawford are described as \u201ccurators\u201d, which, for me, is quite something. This is the kind of opulent space that, in other cities, would be chilly and exclusive; there are squads of the inevitable scenesters, sure, but also families with babies, balding, middle-aged businessmen and even a few fabulously coiffed pensioners. There\u2019s a daily People\u2019s Lunch for only \u00a37.50. \u201cThe Glamour Of Manchester\u201d declares a revolutionary-style mural over the glazed-tile back wall. I can only agree: the Volta duo have tamed this monster of a place, this beast, and turned it into an absolute beauty. \u2022 Refuge by Volta The Refuge, Oxford Street, Manchester M60, 0161-233 5151.

"21||I donate 10 litres of breast milk a weekIhave never breastfed any of my three daughters. When I had my first daughter, Mekayla, in South Africa 10 years ago, no one expected me to breastfeed, including my consultant, who said that using formula was just as good. My attitude changed when I miscarried twins in 2012. Losing them was so hard and even though I know I couldn\u2019t have done anything to prevent the miscarriage, it made me determined to do anything I could to help my children. By this time we were living in Scotland, which has a very different attitude to breastfeeding, but I was still a bit squeamish and didn\u2019t like the idea of doing it myself, though by now I was aware of its benefits. When I became pregnant with our daughter Sarah a year later, I decided to try to express my milk and feed her from a bottle. It seemed the perfect solution, but one of the midwives caring for me was unhelpful, telling me it would be difficult to express milk if I wasn\u2019t actually breastfeeding. When I got annoyed with her, she apologised and backed off quickly, but I guess that made me even more determined to feed my baby the way I wanted \u2013 especially since Sarah was thriving. Mekayla has had digestive problems since she was a baby but we\u2019ve had nothing like that with Sarah. By the time Sarah stopped feeding, I had a freezer full of expressed breast milk which I ended up throwing out because didn\u2019t know what else to do with it. When I was pregnant with Paige (who is now six months old) I read about the donor milk bank at an antenatal clinic and was instantly interested. I learned that nearly 4,000 babies are born prematurely in Scotland every year; because their organs and immune systems have had less time to mature, they\u2019re at greater risk of infection, which can be fatal in their critical early days. Breast milk is often the only thing a very sick or premature baby can tolerate, but mothers with a shortened pregnancy often find that their milk has not yet come in. I knew I could express plenty because of my experience with Sarah; the thought of helping other tiny babies and their worried mums meant a lot to me. I contacted the coordinator of the donor milk bank and she made it really easy, coming to my house to do my blood tests as part of the screening process and talking me through the process, so I was good to go. But then Paige was born a month early and in special care for a couple of days. That\u2019s when we saw those tiny babies who could fit in your hand, only managing to take about 4ml of milk at a time \u2013 and the reality of milk donation hit home. Paige was in special care only as a precaution, but watching those other parents desperately hoping for their babies to survive, and realising I could help, was when the feeling that I should become a milk donor changed to wanting to do it. My partner, Alfie, and I had lost two babies and experienced that pain and now I knew I could make a real difference, helping to keep other people\u2019s babies alive. I now spend about six hours a day expressing milk, which I do four-hourly; I also get up at 2am to express ahead of Paige waking up at 3am for her night feed. I don\u2019t find it uncomfortable, and the more I express, the more milk I produce. The milk is frozen and then picked up every week by one of the volunteer drivers. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m donating record-breaking amounts, and I\u2019ll carry on donating for as long as I can, especially since I\u2019ve now got into such a good routine. Some people are surprised by it, especially as I don\u2019t technically breastfeed my own baby, but it\u2019s just what I do now, while I can. If I\u2019m tired, I just think of those babies in special care and their parents\u2019 gratitude for every single drop of milk that is donated. Six hours a day for 10 litres a week doesn\u2019t seem that hard. \u2022 As told to Joan McFadden. Do you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian.com."
"4||Tottenham\u2019s Harry Kane ready for comeback against ArsenalMauricio Pochettino has suggested Harry Kane could start in Sunday\u2019s derby against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. The striker has been out with ankle ligament damage since the middle of September and he has been expected to make his comeback in the Arsenal game. Earlier in the week, Pochettino was more inclined to use Kane as a substitute but he returned to full training on Thursday and it was clear he had given his manager something to think about. \u201cHarry will be in the squad,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI can confirm he will be available to be selected. I need to decide whether to start him or put him on the bench. I am happy after Thursday. He had a very good training session. He is fit. \u201cAlways, Harry is important. In the last two seasons, he has been very important for us \u2013 he was the top scorer in the Premier League. It\u2019s very good news. It\u2019s good that he will be back.\u201d Kane has scored in each of the previous three Premier League derbies against Arsenal \u2013 including two in the 2-1 home win in February 2015. His return stands to offer an emotional fillip and Pochettino said there was no risk attached to Kane\u2019s involvement. \u201cIt\u2019s not a risk to play him,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI have been at the club for two-and-a-half years and we always try to avoid any risks. If Harry is on pitch or on the bench, it\u2019s because we\u2019re sure it\u2019s not a risk to play him. In football, you can\u2019t avoid all the risk because it\u2019s a contact sport, but if the doctor said he is available to be selected, it\u2019s because there is no risk of injury.\u201d Pochettino said Toby Alderweireld would miss the derby while he continues his recovery from a knee injury, while Erik Lamela is also out with a hip injury. Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is a doubt after twisting his ankle in Wednesday\u2019s Champions League defeat to Bayer Leverkusen. He will be assessed on Saturday."
"4||Step aside Cruyff and Neeskens: East Kilbride poised to break Ajax win recordPerhaps Scotland\u2019s football focus this weekend should not be on Celtic or Rangers. Rather, it should be on the semi-professionals at East Kilbride, as they seek to go where the great Ajax side of 1971-72 could not. Step aside Johan Cruyff, Arie Haan and Johan Neeskens; step forward Kieran Gibbons, Martin McBride and Jacob Kean. East Kilbride, who typically play in front of crowds of 150 in the Lowland League, equalled Ajax\u2019s world record of 26 consecutive victories in competitive fixtures with a win against Vale of Leithen last Saturday. The feat was noted in Amsterdam; Ajax sent a message to the Scottish minnows, hailing a \u201cGreat job\u201d. Twelve of these wins have come this season. Now for the key part and, maybe, the denting of Ajax\u2019s upbeat mood. National media outlets will flock to K-Park on Saturday afternoon to discover if East Kilbride, who have a sprinkling of former full-time players in their ranks, can reach number 27 when they play BSC Glasgow. Pre-match coverage has stretched as far as the Middle East. \u201cMy phone has been ringing nonstop since Saturday but it\u2019s great we are getting this coverage,\u201d Martin Lauchlan, the East Kilbride manager, told the local newspaper this week. \u201cI\u2019ve got to thank East Kilbride News because they put this story out there and it\u2019s amazing how people have responded to it. \u201cBoth K-Park and myself have been taking calls every day from TV channels, radio stations and newspapers, so it\u2019s been pretty hectic. But it\u2019s something for everyone here to enjoy. This could be a momentous day for our football club and I hope the town get down to K-Park and give us their full support.\u201d East Kilbride, population 80,000, has never had a team in Scotland\u2019s league setup but that may change. The Lowland League forms part of a recently introduced pyramid structure, with the champions entering a play-off system at the season\u2019s end with the chance of moving into League Two. Understandably given their run, East Kilbride are 13 points clear at the summit of their league after 12 matches. East Kilbride made headlines in the last campaign, when paired with Celtic in the fifth round of the Scottish Cup. Celtic won 2-0 in a match switched to Airdrie to accommodate a crowd of just under 8,000."

"17||UK new car sales rose by 1.4% in OctoberNew car sales in the UK continued to rise last month as strong growth in businesses buying company vehicles outweighed falling demand from private buyers for a seventh month. Economists focused on the latest deterioration in private car deals, warning that the figures suggest consumers are less willing to make big purchases. A total of 180,168 new cars were registered in October, up 1.4% from a year earlier, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Fleet car registrations drove the growth, up 4.2%, while sales to private buyers fell by 1.1% and have fallen every month since April. Many companies are likely to have made decisions about buying fleet cars before the outcome of the EU referendum, which means it will take some time before the impact of the Brexit vote can be assessed. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data highlighted a \u201csignificant deterioration in consumers\u2019 willingness to make major purchases\u201d, with the recent fall in sterling further depressing demand by pushing up manufacturing costs which in turn pushes up prices. Most cars are imported, and those that are assembled here rely on components made abroad. He noted: \u201cRecent increases in list prices by manufacturers in response to sterling\u2019s depreciation, averaging about 2%, likely have contributed to depressing sales too. Manufacturers have warned that these increases are just the first step in their response to the lower pound.\u201d Ford, General Motors\u2019 Vauxhall division and Nissan are among the carmakers that have hiked prices by 1.5% to 2% in the UK in response to the pound\u2019s slump, according to Automotive News Europe. Only some of this has been passed on to consumers by car retailers, the official data suggests, and other increases have only come into effect in October, Tombs explained. Car sales are likely to hold up for now given low interest rates and the abundance of cheap finance deals. Car sales hit a record for the month of September of 469,696, up 1.6%, as buyers rushed to get the new 66 plate. Sales are 2.5% ahead of 2015 in the year to date, with 2.3m vehicles hitting the road. Last year, sales hit a record of 2.63m and the SMMT predicts a new high of 2.68m cars this year. The industry body is forecasting a drop of 5% for 2017. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe serious concern for the car sector going forward is that it looks inevitable that consumers\u2019 purchasing power will progressively weaken over the coming months as inflation rises appreciably and earnings growth is muted \u2013 which will dilute consumers\u2019 ability and likely willingness to splash out on big ticket items like cars.\u201d Hybrid and electric cars are still proving popular, with sales up 12.4% in October and 23% so far this year to 75,987 \u2013 the highest level ever achieved in the first 10 months of the year."
"15||Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook stake falls $3bn in a dayThe value of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s stake in Facebook has plunged by $3bn, after a warning of slowing advertising growth sent the social media company\u2019s share price tumbling. The Facebook co-founder\u2019s personal wealth has been reduced by 6%, the biggest loss ever suffered by an individual shareholder, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which ranks him as the world\u2019s fifth richest person with a $52bn fortune. Facebook almost tripled its profits in the third quarter after taking a larger slice of the online advertising market. The company reported a 59% year-on-year increase in advertising revenues late on Wednesday. However, investors were concerned by a comment from Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, Dave Wehner, that ad revenue growth would slow \u201cmeaningfully\u201d. The company also said it would push on with \u201caggressive\u201d investments in hiring technology staff. The comments overshadowed the strong results and pushed down Facebook shares by more than 5% on Thursday. Zuckerberg, the chief executive, had said in a statement: \u201cWe had another good quarter. We\u2019re making progress putting video first across our apps and executing our 10-year technology roadmap.\u201d In September, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, pledged to invest $3bn of their personal fortune over the next 10 years with the not insignificant goal of tackling all diseases. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will focus on some of the world\u2019s biggest health problems, including heart disease, cancer, infectious diseases and neurological conditions."
"23||Anne Frank poem, handwritten for a friend,  goes on saleA short poem by Anne Frank written in Amsterdam in 1942 and autographed by the teenager is expected to fetch up to \u20ac50,000 (\u00a344,000) at auction. The handwritten eight-line poem was written in the \u201cpoezie album\u201d, or friendship book, of the older sister of Frank\u2019s classmate and best friend Jacqueline van Maarsen, according to Dutch auction house Bubb Kuyper. The first four lines of the poem can be found in a 1938 periodical, but the next four are not traceable, said Bubb Kuyper, which has put a guide price of \u20ac30,000 to \u20ac50,000 on the poem. \u201cMy sister (nicknamed Cricri) tore this page out of her poezie album and gave it to me around 1970,\u201d writes Jacqueline van Maarsen in a letter accompanying the poem. \u201cI know that my sister was not as attached to this verse from Anne to her as I am to the verse Anne addressed to me, and that is the reason that I am now putting it up for sale.\u201d Signed by Frank, the poem \u201cis a typically edifying poem of the sort that was often written in poezie albums, exhorting the owner to do her best and be diligent at work, so that anyone who reproves her is answered in an honourable manner,\u201d said the auction house. The poem is dated 28 March 1942. By July that year, Anne\u2019s parents would take the family into hiding in an annexe by Otto Frank\u2019s office, where Anne would write the diary that would make her posthumously famous. The Frank family remained in hiding until 1944, when they were arrested and taken to Auschwitz. Anne died in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in February 1945, at the age of 15."
"22||Rotherham: eight men jailed for sexually exploiting teenage girlsEight members of a Rotherham grooming ring have been jailed for between five and 19 years for sexually exploiting and causing \u201cimmeasurable and far-reaching harm\u201d to a teenage girl. The eight men had been found guilty of 19 charges, including rape, indecent assault and false imprisonment of girls as young as 13 between 1999 and 2003. A Sheffield crown court trial, which ended in October, heard how the men \u201csexually degraded\u201d their victims, subjecting them \u201cto acts of a degrading and violent nature\u201d. The men jailed on Friday were Sageer Hussain, 30; Mohammed Whied, 32; Ishtiaq Khaliq, 33; Waleed Ali, 34; Asif Ali, 30; Masoued Malik, 32; Basharat Hussain, 40; and Naeem Rafiq, 33. The judge, Sarah Wright, said they had caused \u201csevere psychological harm\u201d to their three victims. The main complainant, now 27 and a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, told the Guardian she felt vindicated after the men were convicted. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t quite believe it. I felt vindicated. Yet when the verdicts came in, it proved to me that justice could have been done 13 years ago. That could have saved me a lot of heartache,\u201d she said. The woman, who uses the pseudonym Emma Jackson, said her abusers threatened to \u201cgang rape\u201d her mother if she did not submit to their sexual abuse, which took place largely in an alley behind a branch of Boots in Rotherham town centre, in a park and in bushes near a museum. Her family were so afraid they moved to Spain after complaining to the police, social services, their MP and the then home secretary, David Blunkett, the court was told. The woman told jurors that Sageer Hussain \u2013 who is of British-Pakistani origin, along with all but one of the other men in the dock \u2013 first raped her behind Boots when she was 13 and later called her a \u201cwhite slag\u201d when she tried and failed to stop him. She told police that the first and second time he raped her, between 1 January and 4 April 2003, he told her to scream so that his friends, waiting nearby, would know to come and watch. He was found guilty of four counts of rape and one of indecent assault. After the convictions, the National Crime Agency said it was separately investigating more than 11,100 lines of inquiry relating to non-familial child sexual exploitation in Rotherham between 1997 and 2003. Thirty-eight people had been designated \u201csuspects\u201d with many more under investigation, according to the NCA, which is carrying out the independent investigation at the request of South Yorkshire police. NCA staff have been talking to 133 alleged victims and survivors and have recorded 163 crimes. They have identified 17 distinct investigations under the overall inquiry. Nine people have been arrested as part of the operation, codenamed Stovewood, with all suspects bailed until November and December, and one organised crime group has been mapped, identifying the nature and scale of its offending. Money laundering, other financial crime and drug-related offences have also been identified. The operation began after the publication in August 2014 of the Jay report, which said at least 1,400 children in Rotherham had been sexually exploited over a 16-year period from 1997. Sageer Hussain, of Goole, was jailed for 19 years for waging a \u201ccampaign of violent rape\u201d and intimidation against a girl who was only 13 at the time. He had been found guilty of four counts of rape and one of indecent assault. His brother Basharat, also of Goole, was jailed for seven years for indecent assault, to run concurrent with the 25-year jail term he is serving after being convicted of other sexual offences earlier this year. The brothers\u2019 cousin and Sageer\u2019s driver, Mohammed Whied, of Kimberworth, was jailed for five years for aiding and abetting rape. Ishtiaq Khaliq, of Eastwood, was jailed for 17 years for rape and three counts of indecent assault. Waleed Ali, of Rotherham, was jailed for 13 years for rape and indecent assault. Another of the Hussains\u2019 cousins, Asif Ali, of Rotherham, was jailed for 12 years for rape. Masoued Malik, of Rotherham, was jailed for 15 years for rape, false imprisonment and conspiracy to commit indecent assault. Naeem Rafiq, 33, of Bradgate, was jailed for eight years for conspiracy to commit indecent assault and false imprisonment. In a moving victim impact statement read to court, Jackson described how she has panic attacks, anxiety and eating disorders as a result of the abuse. \u201cThere are things and experiences I will never get back or ever have. Things such as going to my school prom, experiencing my last day of school and getting my shirt signed, going on my first holiday with my friends and picking out universities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThose are things I should have done but they were ripped away from me. I don\u2019t know what it is to be a teenager. I will never have memories to look back on and laugh at from that time.\u201d Jackson and the two other victims were in court as Wright jailed their abusers. They sobbed and wiped away tears as their victim impact statements were read to the court. Their abusers showed no emotion as they were jailed. Sageer Hussain appeared to smirk as he was led away. Wright said each of their victims were \u201cgroomed, coerced and intimidated\u201d. Their abuse was \u201ccarefully planned\u201d, she said, adding: \u201cAn abuser would build up their trust and it is a common feature of this case that abusers are often described as initially caring and loving but then turning to becoming controlling and domineering. \u201cSome victims were given alcohol and/or drugs and each of them was given attention. The power that you, the abusers, were then able to have over them meant that the girls distanced themselves from their parents or carers.\u201d Wright praised the dignity and bravery of the victims and their families. In a statement read by police outside court, one of the victims urged others to report grooming: \u201cI know grooming still goes on but I feel that the help is available now if you speak out. Groomers thrive in the silence of others. Speak out and someone will listen.\u201d She added: \u201cIf you see a child in a situation that makes you feel uncomfortable please report it, [child sexual abuse] is everyone\u2019s issue and we all play a part in stamping it out.\u201d DCI Martin Tate, senior investigating officer, said: \u201cThe rape and sexual abuse of children is completely abhorrent and this group have shown no remorse for their crimes, forcing the young women who came forward to report this awful abuse to relive traumatic experiences before the court. \u201cWe are indebted to the victims, who have supported our investigation and have shown remarkable strength in attending court to give evidence.\u201d It can now be reported that four brothers have been involved in, and jailed for, running the Rotherham grooming ring. Sageer and Basharat Hussain are the brothers of two men jailed for 19 years and 35 years respectively in February. They were among 12 men and two women, including Basharat, who were jailed for exploiting vulnerable girls in Rotherham. It can also be reported that Sageer Hussain blamed the Rotherham abuse scandal on young girls wearing miniskirts who were \u201cscreaming rape\u201d, in a television interview two years ago. \u201cThe biggest problem you have these days is you have young girls, that are dressed up ie miniskirts, stuff like that, they\u2019re going into the clubs and they\u2019re ending up going with blokes, stuff like that, and they\u2019re waking up the next morning and they scream rape,\u201d he claimed in a Channel 4 News interview in 2014."
"1||Stephen Phillips MP: 'I can no longer live with being labelled a Tory'A Conservative MP who has resigned after criticising Theresa May\u2019s handling of the Brexit process has said he could no longer live with being labelled a Conservative. Stephen Phillips, who voted for Britain to leave the EU, was unhappy that the government had not planned to consult parliament on the Brexit process. He had also become disillusioned with the government\u2019s attitude towards child refugees and changes to how international aid was spent before making his decision to quit as MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham in Lincolnshire. He told senior Conservatives including May of his plans to step down on Wednesday, before the high court ruling on article 50, sources said. In a letter to George Clark, chairman of the Sleaford and North Hykeham Conservative Association, Phillips said: \u201cSome will label me a quitter or, no doubt, worse. Those are labels with which I can live. The label Conservative no longer is.\u201d Phillips\u2019s resignation has increased the pressure on the prime minister over the proposed Brexit timetable amid demands from leave supporters that she should call a general election. A friend of Phillips said: \u201c[Phillips\u2019s resignation] is about values. The values of this government are not his values. They\u2019ve lurched to the right and become Ukip-lite. He is not.\u201d The friend added that two of the key issues were \u201ctheir failure to honour their promises on child refugees [and] the decimation of international aid to the poorest and most vulnerable in the world\u201d. \u201cBrexit is part of it, because they think they can do what the hell they like without asking parliament. But it\u2019s only a small part of it. It\u2019s the fact that he is not a Conservative in this mould,\u201d the friend said. A source at No 10, when asked whether Phillips\u2019s resignation had come out of the blue, said \u201cyes\u201d, adding that Phillips and May had not met. Friends of Phillips said it would be a lie to pretend that his resignation was a surprise, and said he had informed May on Wednesday, as well the deputy chief whip, Ann Milton, and the Conservative party chairman, Patrick McLoughlin. \u201cThe PM has known since Wednesday; and she has known it would be this morning,\u201d the friend said. \u201cIt is true that [Phillips] and the PM have not met. But that is because he turned down repeated and panicked requests by the whips for a meeting,\u201d the friend said. Phillips, one of the highest-paid barristers in the Commons, had privately warned senior Conservative figures that the high court was likely to rule on Thursday that parliament must vote on when the process can begin. In a statement, Phillips said it had been an honour to serve for six years, but added: \u201cIt has become clear to me over the last few months that my growing and very significant policy differences with the current government mean that I am unable properly to represent the people who elected me.\u201d The prime minister had already lost one Conservative MP when Zac Goldsmith resigned in protest at a decision to allow the expansion of Heathrow airport. His decision triggered a byelection in Richmond Park, south-west London. There will now be a second byelection, in Phillips\u2019s safe Conservative seat in the east Midlands, where he secured a 24,000 majority in 2015. The constituency is in the council area of North Kesteven, where 62% of voters backed leaving the EU. Suzanne Evans, the Ukip leadership candidate, said she was seeking the party\u2019s candidacy for the byelection. Phillips entered parliament in 2010 with a majority of just under 20,000. In May 2013 he threatened to leave the party if David Cameron backed down on his promise to hold an EU referendum, and he voted to leave on 23 June. While serving as an MP, he has topped up his salary by \u00a3750,000 a year working as a barrister and judge. Using his legal skills, he has become a lead inquisitor on the public accounts committee, exposing the failings of HMRC in the pursuit of tax cheats, and on Wednesday he mocked Dfid officials over failed \u00a3323m plans to begin commercial flights to a remote South Atlantic island. A Conservative party spokesman said: \u201cStephen Phillips has been a valuable member of parliament since 2010 and we are sorry that he has chosen to step down.\u201d Clark said the constituency party was disappointed at his resignation and backed the prime minister. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said: \u201cHe will be a great loss to the committee. His skill in getting answers for taxpayers will be sorely missed.\u201d"
"15||The rise and rise of international diplomacy by WhatsAppWhen the world\u2019s nations sit down to talk nowadays, there is a distinct difference to the way diplomacy is done. Influence is no longer defined only by special relationships and old alliances, but which WhatsApp group you are invited into. The rise of WhatsApp diplomacy is transforming the negotiating chamber. There are countless groups of allies and virtual huddles, exchanges over policy statements and fine print, and fair amounts of banter and even emojis (Vladimir Putin is referred to by widespread use of a grey alien avatar). \u201cYou can form small groups of like-minded allies, take photos of annotated documents, ask people what they think without the whole room knowing,\u201d a senior western diplomat said. The tool is useful for communicating with allies who might not be sitting close to them, diplomats say, as well as for agreeing negotiating tactics during difficult sessions and for organising break-out huddles in a way that avoids offending those left out. One notable recent example of WhatsApp summitry occurred at last month\u2019s breakthrough talks in Kigali, Rwanda, about banning HFCs. At these talks the instant messaging tool owned by Facebook was used widely to coordinate meetings, discuss strategy during talks and drum up support for different policy positions, said a consultant who was present. The adviser said the kinds of exchanges included: \u201cLet\u2019s meet outside to talk about x,\u201d or \u201cMake sure you interrupt now,\u201d or \u201cSpeak at the plenary in support of x.\u201d \u201cYou might have a country making a proposition and then there\u2019ll be another opposing proposition, so you\u2019d line up your allies on WhatsApp to say \u2018make sure you express your view\u2019 so there\u2019s a lot of support. And if there are a lot of voices in favour of a proposition it can get through.\u201d The consultant first started seeing WhatsApp used at high-level diplomatic events two years ago but said that recently she has seen more diplomats and lobbyists using it, because of the availability of Wi-Fi and the app\u2019s convenience. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave the room to have a chat \u2018outside\u2019,\u201d the consultant said. \u201cIt allows some discretion if you don\u2019t have to be seen grouping in a corner.\u201d Used by a billion people worldwide, WhatsApp is tailor-made for modern diplomacy. It is as fast and intuitive as texting while the group feature, by which several users can share messages, allows for the formation of fluid informal alliances. And it is secure, with end-to-end encryption since April this year. \u201cYou can send a more secure message through WhatsApp now than most government information systems,\u201d said Jon Alterman, a former state department policy planning staff official now senior vice-president at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. WhatsApp use has flourished particularly in multilateral institutions such as the UN and at EU headquarters, where there are large numbers of diplomats needing to communicate rapidly and secretly. Furthermore a lot of business in these international settings is done inside large buildings with deep basements where there is no mobile phone reception but strong Wi-Fi signals, favouring WhatsApp over texting. An internal report at the UK\u2019s Foreign Office this year found that rather than make use of specially tailored government encryption, many British diplomats use WhatsApp to discuss sensitive issues. There is a WhatsApp group for British diplomats working around the world on Syria issues, for example. \u201cEven 10 years ago the standard form of diplomatic lobbying would often start with a note verbale, a heavily scripted and formulaic diplomatic message sent from an embassy to a foreign ministry,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Tom Fletcher, a former British ambassador to Lebanon. \u201cThe ambassador would then wait for the response, and follow up with a meeting or occasionally a telephone call. Now, all of that can be short circuited by text message \u2013 or, more favoured by diplomats as it is seen as more secure \u2013 WhatsApp. \u201cMost of my day-to-day communication with Lebanese leaders was done in this way. Of course there is no substitute for the rapport and trust built up by face-to-face encounters. But a huge amount of diplomacy can now be handled in this way, and any ambassador who doesn\u2019t have the ability to WhatsApp key ministers will quickly fall behind.\u201d Fletcher, the author of Naked Diplomacy, that calls for a new generation of \u201cdigital interventionists\u201d abroad, added: \u201cThe smartphone is now as essential a part of the modern diplomat\u2019s armoury as courage, patience and a strong stomach. But it is also a threat to the diplomat \u2013 heaven forbid that leaders should start WhatsApping each other direct, without needing to go through their diplomatic envoys.\u201d \u201cWhen you are sitting around a table, negotiating a document, you are not necessarily going to be sitting next to like-minded countries. This is a way to communicate while the negotiations are under way,\u201d a senior diplomat said. \u201cIt can be used for practical organisational stuff, to say we\u2019re meeting in a huddle outside this room,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cOr for lighthearted venting, taking the piss out of a colleague or sending around a picture of someone who\u2019s fallen asleep.\u201d WhatsApp conversations are increasingly punctuated by emojis, which are evolving as a diplomatic shorthand. The full array of flags are ideal for that purpose as are the dove, and of course, the shaking hands, symbolising a done deal. Vladimir Putin is frequently embodied as a grey alien face emoji. In Brussels, WhatsApp is used for organising some of the EU\u2019s many meetings. Messaging services have been used by officials for planning an out-of-town meeting for 28 national ambassadors or getting an EU leader from summit table to press podium without any glitches. One embassy started using WhatsApp after the Brussels attacks as a way of sharing information quickly. However flexible, informal and secret WhatsApp may be, Alterman argues that no messaging system can ever be a substitute for eyeball-to-eyeball diplomacy. \u201cIt still matters if you are in the room with someone. It\u2019s hard to read body language from a text message. Text doesn\u2019t communicate intonation at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge of text-based communication is that people read into it what\u2019s not there, and miss what is there.\u201d"
"21||You can\u2019t choose your family \u2013 or your children\u2019s friendsIt is often said, and truly, that you can\u2019t choose your family. But the lack of choice in a parent\u2019s life goes much further than this. Once you have children forming their own extra-familial relationships, you enter into a community of people that you can\u2019t avoid. Only you don\u2019t have the blood bonds that somehow keep family together (if you\u2019re lucky). Inevitably, you are not going to like all of that imposed community. The chances are, you could cheerfully throttle some of them. With annoying or dislikable kids some recourse is available when they are in your home and in your power \u2013 ideally using tactics that they won\u2019t be able to plausibly squeal about to their parents. You could try subtly undermining their self-esteem (\u201cDo you really feel you need to have that pudding, dear? It\u2019s very calorific\u201d) or being wilfully unfair, perhaps by making sure that their choice of DVD never prevails (\u201cFrozen is scratched I\u2019m afraid \u2026 but this classic black and white documentary on the native wildlife of East Anglia is box fresh\u201d). Such shameful \u2013 but entirely understandable \u2013 malice is particularly tempting when experiencing that modern horror, the sleepover. Here, you find out the true cost of hospitality when, at 1am, little Scheherazade or Cordelia is still cackling at the top of her voice while spreading the remnants of an illicit and adhesive midnight feast across the bedclothes and keeping your own children from sleeping so they will be thoroughly ill-tempered all through the next day. As payback, try a little casual cruelty when they show you their half-witted drawing of a pony, loudly admiring it before listlessly chucking it in the bin, or pointedly offering the dog one of the cookies they just made and pressed on you with their own dear little hands (ideally, you will have trained the dog to refuse it). The parents can present a bigger problem. Let\u2019s assume, for instance, that the parents of little Crispin are card-carrying fascists. Very few people are quite so theatrically evil nowadays, so just say they swear by the Daily Express and have a signed photo of Nigel Farage on their mantelpiece. You have to sit around at their houses, perhaps when coming to pick up the children, while they make lots of veiled yet surly references to hijabs and \u201cso-called refugees\u201d. Or the problem may not be the tiresome opinions of the parents. It may be their behaviour that is problematic. A family with an admirable belief system may nevertheless smoke relentlessly inside the house or let the kids have access to age-inappropriate viewing material, or have pets with fleas that your children pick up and distribute. Grin and bear it is the obvious solution, at least when it comes the adults. Suck your way through cups of ill-brewed tea and leave after a quick biscuit or accepting the invitation for a glass of something stronger. Pretend you have an eating disorder when invited over for dinner. Otherwise, the best solution is just to leave it alone and complain behind their backs. Hypocrisy has served the British well for centuries and it has a lot to commend it. Any attempt to curtail the behaviour of the parents is liable to be seen as snooty and high-minded and is bound to fail. The children are another matter. You\u2019ll almost certainly get away with it. That\u2019s the beauty of the whole thing. Because all parents know their children are so lovable no one could ever wish them ill. That\u2019s certainly the case with mine, who I know are beyond all possibility of being covertly persecuted by my parental peers. Or that\u2019s what I tell them, anyway. @timlottwriter"
"14||The contradictory attacks of the Brexit-loving pressNapoleon famously said: \u201cFour hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets.\u201d I don\u2019t think he had the Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph, Daily Express and the Sun in mind, but three senior British judges may well share Bonaparte\u2019s opinion today. They were castigated by the Brexit-loving newspaper quartet because of their ruling that parliament should trigger article 50 to start the UK\u2019s resignation from the European Union and not the prime minister, Theresa May, using royal prerogative powers. These judges are \u201cthe enemies of the people\u201d, says the Mail. They stand accused of frustrating the will of the people, says the Telegraph. And the Express\u2019s front-page comment indulges in hyperbole to register its disgust: Today this country faces a crisis as grave as anything since the dark days when Churchill vowed we would fight them on the beaches. The Sun is more exercised by the \u201cmotley handful of EU-based campaigners\u201d who launched the legal action. It is particularly upset about the action being \u201cled by a foreign-born multi-millionaire\u201d. (This is a newspaper, incidentally, published by a foreign-born multi-millionaire.) The Telegraph, owned by multi-millionaires living outside of mainland Britain, sticks to the constitutional drama, arguing that the high court should never have treated it as \u201ca justiciable question\u201d. It argues that Lord Thomas, the lord chief justice, Sir Terence Etherton, the Master of the Rolls, and Lord Justice Sales \u201cshould have dismissed the case as an abuse of the legal process\u201d. Oddly, the Telegraph then states: \u201cThis is a political dispute to be settled in parliament, not by judges.\u201d Sorry? Isn\u2019t that the very point of the ruling? Parliament is the sovereign body and will settle it. The royal prerogative is, as its name suggests, an ancient, anachronistic, arcane political instrument that is, fundamentally, anti-democratic. Given the lack of a written constitution, it was always the case that the referendum was advisory rather than binding. It was the will of the people to leave the EU, but the complex manner of the exit is parliament\u2019s, not the prime minister\u2019s, responsibility. But the Telegraph views it as \u201ca bad day for the British constitution\u201d, adding: \u201cWhatever their protestations of legalistic propriety, the courts will be perceived to be helping to frustrate Brexit.\u201d Perceived by whom? Newspaper editors? The Mail sees it as \u201ca betrayal of common sense, the people and democracy.\u201d And it puts the judges in the dock, calling them \u201cthree members of an out-of-touch clique\u201d. (The Mail\u2019s editor, Paul Dacre, a multi-millionaire multiple homeowner, is, of course, a member of an in-touch clique.) In his paper\u2019s opinion, \u201cjudges have time and again backed Europe against the interests of the British people\u201d and, this time around, have delivered a decision based on \u201ca blinkered reading of statutes\u201d. Laughably, it cites the late Lord Denning as a judge likely to have \u201cpicked a way through the dust-encrusted legal textbooks to see the wood for the trees and come down on the side of reason\u201d. (For those who might have forgotten, it was Lord Denning who produced a report on the 1963 Profumo affair that was widely regarded as a meretricious piece of work.) The Mail argues that \u201cat no stage in the long campaign ... did any serious figure suggest the outcome would be merely advisory\u201d. Who, one might ask, is a serious figure? Plenty of people made just that point, including the Financial Times\u2019s legal commentator David Allen Green and Haroon Siddique in the Guardian. Even if the Mail didn\u2019t notice those, does it not remember the piece it ran 15 days before the referendum in which it quoted David Cameron\u2019s father-in-law, Lord Astor, as saying: \u201cThe EU referendum is merely advisory; it has no legal standing to force an exit. Parliament is still sovereign.\u201d Let facts not spoil a good argument though. Anyway, back to those evil judges. According to the Mail, the judiciary is \u201cinfested with Europhiles\u201d and \u201cthere is a strong risk that even supreme court judges may allow subliminal prejudice in favour of the EU to influence their decision\u201d. The paper is worried about \u201cremainer MPs\u201d and \u201cthe overwhelmingly Europhile, unelected Lords\u201d frustrating the will of the people. And then comes a momentous threat: The Mail says very calmly that if the Lords defy the will of the people, then maybe the people should question whether we need such a second chamber. Gosh. I need to sit down. The Mail being calm. That is truly frightening. By contrast, the Express is in its usual hysterical form. It is worried less by peers than MPs, especially those from north of the border. Imagine what poison will be spread by the 54 Scottish nationalist MPs. Imagine the wholly disproportionate power that can be wielded by the eight Euro-fanatical Lib Dems. And imagine how the four million people who voted Ukip at the general election will feel as they see their beliefs trampled in the dust. It was somewhat surprising that the Sun seems reluctant to scream at the judges. Instead it blames Cameron because his \u201cglib promises about the government smoothly enacting the referendum verdict have proved worthless\u201d. And it too falls into the trap of arguing that remainers want \u201cto keep our parliament subservient to Brussels\u201d while contending that parliament should not have the power to deal with the Brexit negotiations. Politicians, it says, must ask themselves whether they will \u201chonour the biggest ballot box mandate in British history ... or sniffily decide the little people cannot be trusted\u201d. So parliamentary sovereignty must be upheld ... but not always."
"21||Bonfire night set to be damp squib as events are axed to save moneyFor decades the citizens of Birmingham have wrapped up warm and trooped along to Pype Hayes park in their thousands for an evening of fun and entertainment on Guy Fawkes night. Not this Bonfire night. The city council has said it cannot justify staging the event in times of austerity and is instead directing Brummies to a private \u2013 and pricey \u2013 event. \u201cI think lots of people are angry,\u201d said Margaret Phillips, landlady of the Bagot Arms pub opposite the park. \u201cFireworks used to be something everyone around here looked forward to. It was really good for local businesses, too. We used to have a really good night in here on Bonfire night.\u201d Communities across the UK are facing the same unwillingness by civic bodies to stage Bonfire night celebrations. Some, like Birmingham, say that when they are making cuts they simply cannot afford it, while others balk at soaring insurance premiums. Other organisations such as Rotary clubs are struggling with the same issues \u2013 plus the thorny old one that it is actually pretty easy to watch an organised firework display for free. One result is that manufacturers of smaller \u201cgarden\u201d fireworks are reporting booming sales \u2013 a worry for fire services, which would prefer Bonfire night events across a city to be contained in as few spaces as possible. The decline of Pype Hayes has been a slow-burner. In 2011 the city council \u2013 the largest local authority in Europe \u2013 cancelled the bonfire, citing budget cuts, but continued to provide fireworks. There was a popular Disney-themed night and one to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the first world war. Last year the council called off Pype Hayes, but said it intended to find a private partner and would be back this time. No partner has been found and the event is off. Cllr Ian Ward, deputy leader of the council, said: \u201cWell publicised budget cuts mean Birmingham, like most local authorities, is facing significant financial pressures. As a result, we have to find partners to help fund our events \u2013 for example, the annual Frankfurt Christmas market in Birmingham is sponsored by Willmott Dixon. \u201cWe were in talks with a partner about this year\u2019s event, but we were unable to reach an agreement, so sadly the fireworks display at Pype Hayes will not take place this year.\u201d Ann Holtom, a Pype Hayes Lib Dem campaigner (and no fan of the Labour-controlled authority), does not hold back in her criticism. \u201cThis incompetent council is unable to find the money for a popular local event,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say they haven\u2019t been able to find a suitable private sponsor, but how hard have they actually been looking? So much for the council\u2019s negotiating skills. No wonder our city finances are in such a mess.\u201d Carl Chinn, professor of Birmingham community history at the University of Birmingham, said it was a pity that the Pype Hayes display was not taking place. \u201cIt is sad. This was a really important community event that brought people together. These municipal bonfires were brought in so that people could enjoy fireworks safely. But the council\u2019s funding has been drastically cut by central government and they have to find savings.\u201d The council was at pains to warn people that it is against the law to set off their own fireworks in the street \u2013 and suggested a fireworks night at Edgbaston stadium as an alternative to Pype Hayes. But its event is not cheap. A family ticket is \u00a318 and a VIP ticket \u2013 which includes a warm private room with bar, hot dog and chips \u2013 is \u00a316 per person. Pype Hayes fireworks regular Jez Davies, a factory worker and father, was not impressed. \u201cThis was always our event. We had pride in it. I loved coming to Pype Hayes as a child and it was great to bring my kids here. It does seem a shame that a huge city like Birmingham can\u2019t put on fireworks.\u201d Birmingham is by no means the only place where there are disappointed fireworks fans wondering what to do this weekend. Ten thousand people attended the display in Walker park, Newcastle upon Tyne, last year. This year, for the first time since the start of the century, there will be no display. David Wood, chairman of the Walker ward committee, explained that it cost \u00a312,000 to put the display on, \u00a34,000 of which went on safety. \u201cWe had a shortfall of \u00a33,000 so thought it best to cancel this year.\u201d Wood said commercial partners were still offering money, but less than previous years. \u201cEveryone up here at least is feeling the effects of austerity,\u201d he said. The committee is planning to plough the money saved into CCTV cameras for the park and will try again next year to raise the money for a display. In north Wales, Llandudno town council has had to cancel its annual display at short notice after it was told it would have to pay at least \u00a322,000 to insure the wonderful Victorian pier in case of a fire. Greg Robbins, chairman of the fireworks sub-committee, said: \u201cWe are very disappointed for the public that this display cannot now go ahead. It has not been possible to find an alternative location. We hope everyone stays safe.\u201d This year Liverpool city council has teamed up with Wirral council on the other side of the Mersey to stage an event called River of Light, which features music and circus performers as well as fireworks set off from three barges. But it means the loss of two traditional Liverpool fireworks displays in Newsham park and Sefton park. Many are expected to take in informal displays closer to home rather than venturing into town. It is not only councils that are cancelling events. For more than three decades the Lions Club of Newbury in Berkshire has staged a Bonfire night event at the racecourse. But the cost of staging the event at such a prestigious venue has become too high, given that bad weather could scupper the whole thing anyway. It has called the display off and will try to find another venue next year. A more fundamental problem has led to the display at East Grinstead FC\u2019s East Court ground being halted. It has run the show since Tony Blair came to power, but too many people had realised that if they tramped up the hill overlooking the ground they could watch for free. Some large local authorities are still staging displays. Up to 80,000 people are expected to attend Lewisham council\u2019s display at Blackheath. The event is free, although donations are requested. London Fire Brigade in Greenwich gave the display its backing, tweeting: \u201cOrganised fireworks displays are far safer &amp; much more fun, support Blackheath fireworks to keep it free and safe.\u201d Across the capital in Newham, the council is also putting on a free display. Lambeth, however, is not reviving its Brockwell park display. It decided to charge in 2014, but thousands of tickets went unsold and the event was cancelled last year. Manchester, backed by local partners, is staging eight free events and is proud of its offer. Cllr Rosa Battle, the city council\u2019s executive member for culture and leisure, said its Bonfire night displays have always been incredibly popular. \u201cWe\u2019re asking locals not to hold their own displays at home and are inviting them to join in the fun and save money by coming along to one of our organised displays. They are free, great fun, and you won\u2019t annoy your neighbours.\u201d"
"22||Rotherham rape victim: 'Justice could have been done 13 years ago'When Sageer Hussain and seven other men from Rotherham were sentenced to prison, the woman they had raped and sexually abused as a teenager was determined to be in the public gallery. Emma Jackson (not her real name) had given evidence behind a screen over three painful days in the witness box at Sheffield crown court. But on Friday she was ready to face her abusers when the judge jailed them. \u201cI want to see their eyes when they get their sentences,\u201d said Jackson, who was branded a \u201cwhite slag\u201d by her abusers, seven of whom are of British Pakistani origin. \u201cI\u2019ve been living with what they did to me for the last 13 years. Now they will know what it\u2019s like to suffer.\u201d Jackson is now 27 and the mother of a young son. She was 13 and 14 when Hussain used drugs and alcohol to groom her for sex. He raped her behind a branch of Boots in Rotherham and at other locations around the South Yorkshire town, before passing her on to one of his brothers, Basharat, two of his cousins and various friends. She reported her abusers at the time, having saved all the clothes she was raped in as evidence. The police lost them. Social workers closed her file because she came from a supportive family in a middle-class area. She once claimed a detective told her: \u201cWe just think it is little white slappers running around with Asians.\u201d At school other pupils branded her a \u201cPaki shagger\u201d. Jackson thinks the ethnicity of her abusers is relevant. \u201cI know that there are Asian girls who have been exploited,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I never saw my abusers with any Pakistani girls. It was always white girls. There is a pattern there that you can\u2019t ignore and it is something we need to tackle.\u201d Jackson\u2019s parents begged for help from their local MP, Kevin Barron; the then home secretary, David Blunkett; and the children\u2019s commissioner, the court was told. But her abusers continued to swagger around Rotherham, threatening her family with violence, to the point that the Jacksons briefly moved abroad to try to start a new life. The unanimous guilty verdicts delivered last month came as a tremendous relief, but also brought frustration. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t quite believe it. I felt vindicated. Yet when the verdicts came in, it proved to me that justice could have been done 13 years ago. That could have saved me a lot of heartache.\u201d Now a campaigner against child sexual exploitation, Jackson wants an official apology from South Yorkshire police. Though she praises the officers who brought her case to court, she would like a letter acknowledging that the force failed her as a teenager. \u201cIt would mean a lot to me to receive an official apology,\u201d she said. Six years before the court case, Jackson wrote a book, Exploited, about her experiences, and had given evidence to the home affairs select committee. When the prominent social worker Alexis Jay published her report on sexual exploitation in Rotherham, saying at least 1,400 children had been abused in the town over a 16-year period, Jackson went public to say she was one of them. But nothing could quite prepare her for the ordeal of giving evidence. Walking into court on the first day, she couldn\u2019t see Hussain but immediately caught a whiff of his aftershave from behind the screen. Now 30, he was wearing the same brand as he had in his teenage years. \u201cHis smell was a big thing for me. It made me feel a bit sick,\u201d she said. Jackson was infuriated at her cross-examination in the witness box. \u201cThe barristers just dragged everything up. It was a load of old crap. I was warned in advance that it wasn\u2019t personal and the barristers were just doing their jobs, but it felt personal. It was quite maddening. \u201cIt\u2019s not a nice experience because they literally rip you to pieces. They try to trip you up; it\u2019s as though they try and manipulate your words. To me it seems that it\u2019s the victim who is the one who is put through the mill. That makes me quite angry.\u201d With her abusers now in jail for the foreseeable future, Jackson plans to move on with her life. She is catching up on the education she missed out on as a teenager and plans to go to university next year to study social work. But she will never be able to forget what happened to her. \u201cThey took my education \u2013 that has set me back. It\u2019s affected my relationships because I can\u2019t fully trust people. I have mental health issues and suffer a lot from depression. But it\u2019s not just my mental health that has been affected: my immune system is weak too. I pick up bugs really easily and have had glandular fever and shingles. It\u2019s affected my life massively.\u201d"
"8||The UK was already short of curry chefs. Now the Brexit vote has made it worseOn the pin-board in my office in parliament is a letter from the BCA, the Bangladesh Caterers Association, \u201cestablished 1960\u201d as the letterhead points out, to fight for the rights of Indian restaurant workers \u2013 the nearest thing we have to a curry trade union. It thanks me for raising the \u201ccurry crisis\u201d in the House of Commons to George Osborne last November. At the time I lamented that two Indian eateries a week were closing and declared it would be a national tragedy if this much-loved staple of the UK high street were to disappear. A year later it seems so many more tragedies have unfolded \u2013 not least the referendum result. Osborne and David Cameron have gone; the latter has completely left the crime scene, and the leave supporting BCA, furious that it has been sold down the river by the Brexiteers, is spitting feathers in the FT and Mirror. I hate to say \u201cI told you so\u201d but we remainers were always sceptical when the pro-leave side promised that a vote to leave the EU would mean subcontinental chefs would be welcomed with open arms. Alas, the curry unions bought it. The Economist has observed \u201cThe curry house is a British institution\u201d. At the high watermark of New Labour, Robin Cook declared chicken tikka masala was the national dish. Of course it is British Bangladeshis, not Indians, who are the main engine of the Indian restaurant industry, providing the UK\u2019s balti, jalfrezi and korma dishes among others. I\u2019m a product of the trade: my late father had two tandoori establishments at one time, and toiled tirelessly to support us. Even my mum did her share of unsociable hours for the Huqs\u2019 curry career. The contribution of the curry trade to the exchequer is substantial; it is estimated to be worth \u00a35bn to the British economy, and annually employs 200,000 people \u2013 but it has staffing problems. The British Bangla population is now coming of age and branching out \u2013 the nation\u2019s most famous Bengali is probably Nadiya Hussain, last year\u2019s Great British Bake Off winner, a title attained not by making naan but cupcakes. My siblings and I didn\u2019t fancy working in the family business \u2013 one became a Blue Peter presenter, while I became a lecturer and am now an MP. Following a familiar immigrant trajectory, there\u2019s also been diasporic shift from the inner cities to the leafier suburbs. Back in 1971 George Harrison sang \u201cBangladesh, sure looks like a mess\u201d. This description now applies to the situation unleashed by the self-destructive decision to leave the EU following the monumental miscalculated gamble of the referendum. Government back-of-a-fag-packet immigration policy aiming to reduce immigration down to the tens of thousands is not only a flop but it\u2019s unworkable. Constrained by dogma, the Tories are intent on aping Ukip rather than addressing genuine skills shortages in our economy be it in fruit-picking, IT or curry cooking. Another unwelcome byproduct of a vote that centred on immigration is the attendant climate of emboldened xenophobia and rocketing hate-crime \u2013 and we haven\u2019t even left the EU yet. When I was growing up we were all Asians together. Now faith seems to be more clearly asserted, and those who are mixed race make up an ever-bigger demographic. No party can take Asian votes for granted. Perhaps it was for this reason that Priti Patel was chosen to woo the subcontinental chefs during the referendum campaign. On the Today programme and elsewhere curry leaders accordingly came out for Leave, believing this was the only way to save their industry from extinction. I doubt that the curry constituency could have swung the result, but it was sorely misled. This week, addressing the Commons from the opposition frontbench for the first time as newly promoted shadow home affairs minister, I asked about that promise. I wanted to know when we could expect the red carpet to be rolled out for curry cooks from the subcontinent. I got a big fat raspberry. Theresa May\u2019s immigration minister declared that there are no plans to deviate from the long-stated strategy to have our own home-grown curry chefs rather than to import them. Just as Osborne said 12 months ago. No change there then. The pledge had as much value as the NHS money promised on the side of that infamous bus. My office has also received an invitation to the glitzy British Curry awards. This year it promises the Right Hon Priti Patel at the event as chief guest. It\u2019s not made the pin-board, even if we so-called \u201cremoaners\u201d have had some wind in our sails after yesterday\u2019s high court judgement. I\u2019m giving the bash a miss \u2013 Brexit and its entanglement with curry has left a bit of a sour aftertaste."

"23||JK Rowling's hand-drawn Tales of Beedle the Bard go up for auctionA handwritten copy of JK Rowling\u2019s story collection The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which she made for the publisher who first accepted Harry Potter for publication, is set to fetch up to \u00a3500,000 when it is auctioned next month. Rowling handwrote and illustrated six copies of her collection of fairytales set in the Harry Potter universe, giving them as presents to \u201cthose most closely connected to the Harry Potter books\u201d. A seventh copy, which Rowling made to raise money for her charity Lumos, was sold at auction by Sotheby\u2019s in 2007 for \u00a31.95m. The manuscript, which Sotheby\u2019s will auction in London on 13 December with a guide price of between \u00a3300,000 and \u00a3500,000, was made for publisher Barry Cunningham, who signed up Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone for Bloomsbury. Cunningham was sent the manuscript of The Tales of Beedle the Bard on 12 December 2007 in a white Jiffy envelope. Inside was a cloth-wrapped, leather-bound manuscript covered in semi-precious stones and featuring a silver mounted skull. A note from Rowling in the front of the edition reads: \u201cTo Barry, the man who thought an overlong novel about a boy wizard in glasses might just sell \u2026 THANK YOU.\u201d The Tales of Beedle the Bard play a crucial role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final novel in Rowling\u2019s fantasy series. A copy is left to Hermione Granger by Albus Dumbledore, and contains clues used by the friends in their quest to destroy Voldemort. \u201cThe personal resonance of this book makes this both an exceptional and highly desirable object to come to auction,\u201d said Dr Philip W Errington, director of Sotheby\u2019s books and manuscripts department, \u201cIt is particularly special as it is only one of six made for those closest to the author throughout the journey of creating the Harry Potter series, gifted to the man who recognised the brilliance of JK Rowling\u2019s writing and her potential impact on children\u2019s literature.\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said that the stones on the manuscript\u2019s cover are rhodochrosite, which Rowling notes at the end of the volume are \u201ctraditionally associated with love, balance and joy in daily life\u201d."

Indeed, the opposable thumb itself likely developed as an adaptation to safe movement in the trees tens of millions of years before our forebears hit the savannah.

Dinosaur brains and other remarkable fossil finds | Lost Worlds Revisited Ultimately, it all comes down to the decay of tissues. The reason that bones, teeth and shells (and for that matter wood) are common as fossils is that they decay only very slowly. Carnivores and scavengers don\u2019t tend to eat bones (and if they do, the bones might still survive the process) and bacteria don\u2019t break them down effectively. As a result, they can hang around for decades or centuries and have greater opportunities to be buried and potentially turn into a fossil. Soft tissues tend instead to be eaten so would need to be buried soon after the animal died in order to have a chance to be fossilised (and even here the bacteria or fungi may get to them). A more effective method of preservation, though, is to be in an environment where decay does not tend to occur.

"12||The Crown review \u2013 the \u00a3100m gamble on the Queen pays off royallyA man coughs bloodied lung lining up into a toilet bowl. Later, he asks his doctor if he should be concerned about \u201ca spot of blood in my spittle\u201d. You could only be in England, and so it very much turns out we are. The year is 1947, the toilet bowl is in Buckingham Palace and the man spattering it with sanguineous sputum is King George VI, on the morning of his eldest daughter Princess Elizabeth\u2019s marriage to Johnny Foreigner, known to his friends as Philip Mountbatten. So opens The Crown, Netflix\u2019s latest and most ambitious foray in the world of original programming. It is written by Peter Morgan (who wrote 2006\u2019s Oscar-winning The Queen, and the 2013 play The Audience, which both offered robust takes on the Royal family and its accreted lore), with the first two episodes directed by Stephen Daldry, and is rumoured to have cost \u00a3100m to make. Which is one reason \u2013 or rather, about 90m of them \u2013 that you are seeing it on the streaming service and not on the channel that would seem its most natural home, the BBC. As soon as Phil the Greek (played by Matt Smith) has finished renouncing his nationality and titles, and been made the Duke of Edinburgh, he and Elizabeth (Claire Foy) are wed. Winston Churchill mutters exposition from the pews \u2013 \u201cHis uncle lost India! His sisters are all married to Nazis! Prominent Nazis!\u201d \u2013 but the newlyweds care not. They redecorate Clarence House and look forward to a long and happy life together there and, for the furtherance of Philip\u2019s naval career, in Malta. You know how it ends. The king dies and Elizabeth becomes queen decades before anyone expected. There is no question of her refusing. The country was on its knees after the war, plus Edward VIII had used up all the suit-yourself slack in the royal system in 1936. The early years of her reign play out in a suitably stately fashion over the next nine hours. This may not be one to binge-watch quite so rapidly as other Netflix offerings \u2013 crown, state and church favour small, subtle nudges of each other and loaded silences, rather than loaded guns and pile-driver plots, which doesn\u2019t exactly make the pace sluggish, but it does mean that one or two episodes at a time feels plenty. All the main historical markers are hit. There\u2019s Churchill\u2019s re-election and battle with ill-health (he is played, magnificently and in the end impossibly movingly, by John Lithgow), the toxic London smog of 1952, Commonwealth tours as anti-British sentiment gathers round the globe, the coronation, the refusal to let Princess Margaret and Group Captain Peter Townsend marry, the beginning of Anthony Eden\u2019s premiership (and Benzedrine habit), but so \u2013 more cleverly and infinitely more pleasingly \u2013 are the less tangible changes undergone by the people at their hearts. Foy\u2019s performance as Elizabeth Mountbatten is as ruthlessly unshowy as the woman herself. It\u2019s a considerable challenge to play a character who becomes more and more fiercely restricted over time, but Foy manages to register every layer of misery and frustration as Elizabeth Ordinarius evolves into Elizabeth Regina, seeking a way to reconcile the conflicts of personal freedom and desire, wifehood and queendom and to work out quite what to do with advice such as the prime minister\u2019s: \u201cLet them see only the eternal in you\u201d. Matt Smith is her equal, albeit in an easier role, as Philip, a fundamentally good (if gaffe-prone from the start) man struggling to fulfil an unexpected duty that emasculates him at every turn. His children cannot bear his name, he cannot walk ahead of his wife, he cannot refuse to kneel before her at the coronation, he cannot continue his naval career. The list of cannots for a royal consort is an ever-growing one. Theirs are the compromises of every marriage gender-swapped and writ large. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent and blessed with a psychologically acute script (the occasional clunker such as \u201cProminent Nazis!\u201d notwithstanding) that makes them not ciphers but rounded characters who manage still to excite the sympathy their distant, privileged lives otherwise militate against. As a result, there are some fantastically moving scenes. The widowed Queen Mother\u2019s grief breaking through over dinner with old friends in Scotland, the king moving gratefully among the carol singers at Sandringham before he has told the family he is dying, and \u2013 above all, perhaps \u2013 Churchill realising as he sits for his portrait with Graham Sutherland that the pond the prime minister paints again and again is the one he had made in the garden after his daughter Marigold died. When the BBC makes anything about the royal family, a senior executive \u2013 I imagine him lightly oiled and on a Segway emblazoned with a royal coat of arms on one side and Alan Yentob\u2019s face on the other, zipping between the palace and Broadcasting House \u2013 acts as liaison officer between the two. Morgan and his team did two and a half years\u2019 research but had no direct contact with the palace whatsoever. It seems to have freed them to make a rich, non-reverent drama that jibes with what we know, or think we know, about them without being enslaved by it. If it feels, just occasionally, like a very high-quality soap \u2013 well, which decade of any family\u2019s history would not, even without the high stakes this one plays with every day? Netflix can rest assured that its \u00a3100m gamble has paid off. This first series, about good old British phlegm from first to last, is the service\u2019s crowning achievement so far. \u2022 The Crown is available on Netflix now."
"8||I spent years chasing perfection. Then I decided to embrace messinessGrowing up in a mentally ill, violent, addiction-riddled home with Catholicism lurking, I was filled with fear. I never learned to look to myself for an opinion, but to monitor the emotions of others to get a sense of how I was doing. Needless to say, this was exhausting and overwhelming. To make things worse, I was excellent at figuring out how to please people. It was in the middle of being raped at 19 years old that I realized that the whole reason I was on my back in the first place was my fear of being rude to a complete stranger who wanted to walk me home. I didn\u2019t tell anyone about this because I felt guilty and didn\u2019t want anyone to think badly of me. So for the next 20 years I decided to make up for my mistake by being perfect. I decided to be a perfect student, wife, teacher, mother, Catholic. I tried to be nice, and above reproach. But as I pursued all this, my world began to shrink \u2013 by limiting my activities I could do things more perfectly. I wanted my house to be clean, my garden to be perfect, my list of things to do completed. My efforts exploded when I developed health problems from a tick bite. I was in pain and miserable, with constant respiratory infections, migraines, body pain, heart palpitations, insomnia, night sweats and memory loss. This all made it impossible to cultivate the ideal woman image I\u2019d thrown myself into projecting. My career as a teacher, my interactions with the community and even relationships with my child and husband began to shrink. I had panic attacks and agoraphobia. I became a living manifestation of fear. I needed help to do everything. I did not feel I deserved the oxygen I breathed. It didn\u2019t help that, in the midst of all this, my husband divorced me, leaving me alone and poor. I was pretty sure that I was going to die, even if that meant killing myself, so it seemed to me I had no choice but to start doing all of the things that scared me. The idea that my ailments could do me in fueled me in a way. What did I have to lose? I started behaving in all the ways I formerly saw as imperfect or improper. I drove without my seatbelt until my son told me he needed me. I sang in front of people when in the past I would black out giving a book report. I stole something and didn\u2019t feel like God loved me any less. I trespassed and broke into buildings and even posed nude for an art school despite the body shaming I was raised with. I hung out with folks I previously would have judged as sketchy. To anything that I judged or feared, I just said yes. The more I tried things \u2013 the more I interacted with others \u2013 the less I judged others while finding compassion for myself. I found help for my medical problems as well. I became a better parent. Today it is my yoga practice, found in this period of chaos, that keeps me healthy and strong. Parts of it are comforting and parts of it are terrifying, but I don\u2019t give myself the option to quit. I still experience fear, but I have tools to deal with it. I practice staying with what is actually going on now because that is all that I can work on. I stay out of the past and talk myself out of worrying about the future. I make sure the decisions I make are not from fear but love for myself. Fear is no longer my uninvited, messy houseguest, hunkering down on the couch and watching my futile attempts to be superhuman.

"5||Pain, anger and fear: US voters deprived of a serious presidential electionThe steak and eggs had just been served at Davie\u2019s Chuck Wagon Diner, in the suburbs of Denver, when the discussion turned to conspiracy. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna steal the election,\u201d said Charlene Hardcastle, a nurse in a \u201cColorado Women for Trump\u201d T-shirt. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all seen that on the internet.\u201d There were nods and murmurs of agreement from the assembled Republican activists. This was not so much a campaign to elect Donald Trump \u2013 it was an effort, in Hardcastle\u2019s words, to \u201cshake the foundations of democracy\u201d should Hillary Clinton be declared the winner. \u201cWe can get out the vote as much as we want, but if they recalibrate that voting machine, it\u2019s like \u2013 forget it,\u201d she said. That was three months ago, the first of dozens of times I would hear similar complaints as I traveled the country with my colleague Tom Silverstone filming the Guardian\u2019s Anywhere But Washington series, a 4,500-mile trip to eight mostly battleground states. Trump has fueled talk of a rigged election in the final weeks of the campaign, but the loss of faith in America\u2019s political system has been brewing for years and bestrides both sides of the political system. Recently a Bernie Sanders supporter cornered me in a cafe in Tucson, Arizona, to explain how she believed voting machines controlled by Dick Cheney awarded Clinton an additional 3 million votes in the Democratic primary. If there\u2019s a single theme to emerge from my encounters in states as varied as Maine, Wisconsin and Nevada, it is abject disillusionment: a feeling everywhere that the country has been deprived of a serious election. Instead of a conventional campaign, voters feel they have witnessed a Netflix political drama, an outlandish plot consisting of a Republican who is a former reality TV host, and unmasked as a sexual predator, and a Democrat who, courtesy of an aide\u2019s husband\u2019s sexting habit, cannot shake the shadow of an FBI investigation. This is not politics \u2013 it is entertainment. The tragedy is that while America has been binge-watching this made-for-TV spectacle, many have failed to notice how this election has shifted the ground beneath their feet. Inequality meets unrealistic promises There are few places where the political landscape is turning to quicksand as quickly as McDowell, the poorest county in West Virginia. A forlorn place dotted with shuttered coalmines and abandoned homes, McDowell was once a Democratic heartland but is quickly shifting allegiance \u2013 Barack Obama won there in 2008, but Mitt Romney took it by a wide margin in 2012. This year, it was the county in which Trump won his highest percentage of primary votes. There are more than 3,000 counties in the US \u2013 none voted for Trump as overwhelmingly as McDowell, where he secured 91.5% of the vote. How can it be that a tax-avoiding billionaire who flies around in a gold-plated private jet is most popular in a place where more than half the population lives off donations from a food bank? One reason is that there is hope in his promise \u2013 dismissed by energy experts as unrealistic \u2013 to revive a coalmining industry that is no longer profitable. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put the miners back to work,\u201d he promised 12,000 people at a rally in West Virginia days before the state\u2019s primary. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get those mines open.\u201d But the roots of Trump\u2019s popularity in places such as this precede his candidacy; indeed, they have been decades in the making. Democrats in McDowell have lost faith in their party, which has run the local government their entire lives and controlled the White House for most of the past quarter-century. \u201cIt\u2019s our own fault,\u201d said Martin West, the local sheriff, a Democrat who will vote for Trump. \u201cYou keep voting for people that never come to assist you.\u201d The combined presidencies of Bill Clinton and Obama have done little to arrest soaring inequality in America, and some would argue both presidents accelerated it. The situation in McDowell, by almost every measure, has gotten progressively worse throughout that period. Life expectancy \u2013 the starkest gauge of all \u2013 has declined continually since 1981. The high rate of suicide and the impact of the opioid epidemic have combined to put McDowell\u2019s rates of mortality on par with Ethiopia. \u201cNone of us are that blind to think that Trump is going to save all of us,\u201d said Brian Harrison, a coalminer who switched from Democrat to Republican eight years ago. \u201cBut at least there\u2019s some hope.\u201d He added of Trump: \u201cI think he\u2019s more for the working person than Hillary is.\u201d Industrial decline hits the heartlands There is evidence of blue-collar Democrats fleeing to Trump this election in other pockets of the industrial rust belt, including battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire. Clinton still looks poised to win those states, all of which Obama won in 2008 and 2012. But even if Trump loses these places, his candidacy has peeled back the bandage to reveal Democratic heartlands reeling from industrial decline. Democrats might reassure themselves that Trump\u2019s populist candidacy will not be easily repeated \u2013 that no conventional Republican will abandon free-market principles, as the real estate mogul has done, to embrace protectionist trade policy. But Trump\u2019s appeal in parts of the country where manufacturing jobs have been outsourced overseas is not always connected to his specific opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership or denunciation of China\u2019s currency manipulation. Many voters just seem to appreciate his acknowledgment that towns and cities that were once booming are now in decay. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand trade policies,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Arroyo, who has been working with the United Steelworkers to stem the exodus of Democratic voters around Youngstown, an Ohio city surrounded by abandoned, crumbling factories. \u201cWhat they do understand is that they used to work at a place that paid them $80,000 a year, and now they\u2019re working two jobs to make $30,000 a year.\u201d Ohio is one of the Obama states that Trump does look likely to win, in part through his appeal in places such as Youngstown to white, working-class voters without a college degree who previously identified as Democrats. \u201cI used to call myself and others robot voters,\u201d said Leo Conway, a union worker and Democrat voting Republican for the first time in his life. \u201cIt\u2019s the definition of insanity,\u201d he said of his previous party loyalty. \u201cYou keep putting the same people in the same job and expect a different outcome.\u201d I met Conway at a Republican picnic in Ohio\u2019s Mahoning County, known as ground zero for these crossover voters. But he was not drawn to Trump\u2019s economic message so much as his muscular military rhetoric and his anti-establishment appeal. In fact, barely anyone mentioned the area\u2019s industrial decline, which was most acute in the 1980s. Instead, I heard people complain that illegal immigration is out of control, law and order is unraveling in the inner cities and government assistance is creating a lazy, welfare-dependent underclass. There is often a racial connotation to all of these grievances, one that Trump has exploited, sometimes explicitly, but more often than not through an ugly brand of dog-whistle politics that has stoked racial tensions. Those surfaced during my interview with Trump\u2019s local campaign chair, Kathy Miller, who was forced to resign when we broadcast her comments. \u201cIf you\u2019re black and you haven\u2019t been successful in the last 50 years, it\u2019s your own fault,\u201d Miller said. \u201cYou had all the advantages and didn\u2019t take advantage of it. It\u2019s not our fault, certainly.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any racism until Obama got elected,\u201d she added. \u201cWe never had problems like this.\u201d How backlash could affect the ballot Eight years after the election of the first black president, some have framed Trump\u2019s rise as some sort of \u201cbacklash\u201d by a silent majority of mostly white men who resent their fading political power. There could be some merit to that analysis, but there seems to me an equal if not greater counterweight from the many people who feel offended and even threatened by the Republican nominee. Most of America is not in decay, and its increasingly diverse population creates a built-in advantage to any Democrat seeking the White House. The challenge for Clinton was always going to be reconvening the broad coalition of millennials, college-educated voters and minorities that twice helped elect Obama. Clinton, hamstrung by controversy, especially over her use of a private email server for government business, has struggled to articulate a positive vision of the future that could inspire these voters. The conversations I have had in supermarkets, churches and county fairs have made plain that while many voters see Trump as an almost comical liability, their concerns with Clinton take a more somber tone. She has frequently been described to me as untrustworthy, corrupt and uncaring, the epitome of a rotten political establishment. I\u2019ve seen neighborhoods across America, from the affluent suburbs of Waukesha, Wisconsin, to Denver\u2019s sprawling suburbs, where well-kept lawns are dotted with \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d yard signs. \u201cThat\u2019s where she belongs,\u201d said Bob Howe, who had one such sign outside his hunting lodge in Maine. \u201cFrigging lying, cheating, thieving.\u201d In the face of such distrust, Clinton\u2019s greatest asset has turned out to be her opponent, the only major presidential candidate in modern history who has been more unpopular than her. Trump\u2019s extraordinary campaign has scrambled the electorate, winning unusual allies while giving many of the people I met a reason to vote. There was the woman in an Ohio restaurant who showed me a picture of her two-year-old son who is partially deaf and has cerebral palsy. Her voice shook and her eyes welled with tears as she recounted the rage she felt watching Trump mocking a disabled person on TV. \u201cI\u2019m not a violent person,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I just felt like strangling him.\u201d There was the barber in Milwaukee, a city reeling from a succession of police shootings of black men, offended by Trump\u2019s claim African Americans like him have \u201cnothing to lose\u201d. \u201cWe have a lot more to lose,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cOur lives.\u201d And there are the many people like Carmela Perez, a Mexican American who has raised seven children in a mobile home on the outskirts of Las Vegas and has dedicated the past four months to electing Clinton. If the polls are correct, it is people like her \u2013 Latinos and women \u2013 who are poised to support the Democratic nominee in record numbers this election. Perez took a leave of absence from her job washing dishes at the MGM casino to join Clinton\u2019s army of ground operatives in Nevada after she heard the Republican nominee insult Mexicans. She said Trump\u2019s comments about women steeled her determination, canvassing for Clinton six days a week in the desert heat. By election day, she will have knocked on 5,000 doors. \u201cFor me, this is personal,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI feel very offended, wounded. He stabbed me in my guts.\u201d"
"4||Gareth Southgate says he may reject any full-time offer of England jobGareth Southgate is undecided whether he would accept the permanent England manager\u2019s job should the FA make him an offer after the forthcoming games with Scotland and Spain. The interim manager is enjoying the role more than he anticipated, after filling the breach following Sam Allardyce\u2019s sudden departure in September, but would want to know the length of contract, among other things, before committing himself. The 46-year-old is making no assumptions after stepping up from managing the England Under-21s for last month\u2019s World Cup qualifiers with Malta, which England won 2-0, and the goalless draw in Slovenia and expects the position to go to interview even if he prospers in the two games at Wembley over the coming 11 days. \u201cThe agreement was to take these four games, to keep some continuity, and then everybody has a chance to reflect and review how\u2019s it gone,\u201d Southgate said, speaking exclusively with the Football Journalism degree class at the University of Derby. \u201cThe FA [then] have a decision to make as to what they want to do. I think it\u2019s a decision that needs a lot of thought, and also I think when you\u2019re in the position I am in, you need to be clear of what is being asked. \u201cThere is a big difference, for example, between being asked to take the team over the summer or to take the team for three years or take the team for a year and a half. I don\u2019t think it is as easy as saying: \u2018Yes I would like the job,\u2019 and I would also like to see how it is affecting my family \u2013 and my health probably!\u201d After gaining four points from his first two games, Southgate is very relaxed about the situation. Having won the Toulon Tournament with the under-21s in June, he is very well thought of at St George\u2019s Park, where he has worked closely with Dan Ashworth, the technical director, on a unified development plan for all England teams over the past four years. He is committed to long-term development so taking charge until Euro 2020 would enable Southgate to see if the current plans could bear fruit. Martin Glenn, the FA chief executive, has said that Southgate is \u201ca credible candidate\u201d regardless of the outcome of the World Cup qualifier next Friday and the friendly with Spain four days later. Southgate, who in the summer had ruled himself out of succeeding Roy Hodgson, said: \u201cWhatever happens after that I will have had an incredible life experience which will have made me a better manager, no question, and everybody will know more about [my] suitability for that role. So I think our guys are then going to want to interview people to see who the best candidates are and go through a process, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Southgate is enjoying working with the senior players and wants to assess whether he feels the manager-team relationship would benefit England. \u201cReally then I will have an idea of what I am able to do, what I\u2019m able to affect, how that has been with the players, how that has been with the staff and how I feel myself really. All I can say is I have enjoyed the period up to now.\u201d Gareth Southgate was speaking to students on the UK\u2019s only Football Journalism degree course, at the University of Derby, www.derby.ac.uk/journalism"

Nothing\u2019s Real is a faster slice of disco pop and perhaps the finest song written about a panic attack since, well, Bright Eyes\u2019 entire career. \u201cThey\u2019re telling me there\u2019s nothing wrong\u201d, Shura sings, as the beeps of an ECG machine merge with ominous synth strings and a defibrillator beat. The 1975 She\u2019s American The 1975 are an excellent band. This doesn\u2019t mean that 80% of their songs don\u2019t sound exactly the same \u2013 tell me this doesn\u2019t have a bassline that is totally indistinguishable from The Sound. Yet the one downside to the 1975 is that Matt Healy still insists on swigging from a bottle of wine on stage, which is something I used to do during my teen slam-poetry days. A friend recently contacted me to say she found some copies of these early works. Please respect my privacy at this difficult time.

"21||Alfred Molina: \u2018My mother and I had a few moments that were like the third act of Aida\u2019My dad, Esteban, was Spanish and my mother, Giovanna, Italian. I went to a Roman Catholic secondary modern in Notting Hill, west London, before Julia Roberts moved in. It was a working-class immigrant neighbourhood and a lot of kids in my school were the sons of immigrants, so my parents weren\u2019t the only ones with a foreign accent. I didn\u2019t stick out. My parents divorced when I was 12. My brother, Roberto, who\u2019s seven years younger, was sent to live with my dad and I was ordered to live with my mother. She was a big personality and very complex. She was all the things you want a mother to be \u2013 loving, attentive, caring and a lot of fun \u2013 but looking back I realise that she was probably depressive. She was incredibly generous, too. She had a friend at work who was a transvestite, a gay man who would go to parties and drag up. He was the same size as my mum and she used to lend him clothes. He\u2019d come on a Friday night, leave with a holdall and come back on a Sunday. My mum could be embarrassing, too. She came to the end-of-the-season party at the RSC in the 70s when I was a spear carrier and said: \u201cWhere is your boss?\u201d I gingerly took her over to Trevor Nunn, who was the artistic director and was talking with Judi Dench, and he was very sweet to my mum. Then she asked, \u201cTrevor, is my Alfred a good actor?\u201d Trevor went, \u201cHe\u2019s a very good actor,\u201d and she said, \u201cIf he\u2019s so good, why you don\u2019t give him a job?\u201d I wished the ground would swallow me up My mum was only 56 when she died of a massive blood clot on the brain. She had gone back to Italy and found real, genuine happiness with a childhood sweetheart, which was pleasing to us. My relationship with her was very tempestuous. I loved her to death and I know she loved me, but we were both strong personalities and I inherited a lot of her fire and energy. We had a few moments that resembled the third act of Aida. My relationship with my dad was cordial but not very close, and I never quite reconciled with him before he died in 1999, which I regret. I have nothing but respect for him, because he worked like a Trojan all his life. He\u2019d fought in the Spanish civil war and the second world war and then worked hard as a waiter. I was a bit of a show-off as a kid, apparently. I was very lucky my first day at secondary school was also the first day of a new English master, Martyn Corbett, who started a drama club and directed all the school plays. He was like a dad and a mentor, and was the first person in my life who took me seriously when I said I wanted to be an actor. I lived for his Wednesday night drama club. When I got turned down for a drama school grant because I forgot my lines, he wrote an impassioned letter asking them to give me another chance, and they did. My ex, Sue, and I broke up quite quickly after our daughter, Rachel, was born in 1980, and, although I wasn\u2019t absent, I was pretty much a weekend dad. I tried to be the best dad I could, although I made all kinds of mistakes. I\u2019ve got a very good relationship with my daughter, but I think that is more to do with her generosity than any parental skills I might have. My marriage is in a strange place now because my wife [the actor Jill Gascoine] is in a very advanced stage of Alzheimer\u2019s. I looked after her for a few years at home, but she began to need specialised care that I wasn\u2019t able to provide, so we found a very nice home for her over two years ago. It has been tough, but no tougher than what a lot of others go through. I went to a support group and to therapy for people in my situation; the stories I heard of sacrifice and hardship made me realise I had nothing to complain about. \u2022 Close to the Enemy begins on 10 November, 9pm, BBC2"
"27||Yang Liping: Under Siege review \u2013 beauty, blood and backflipping warlordsIt\u2019s hard to think of a more visually ravishing production this year than Yang Liping\u2019s Under Siege. It\u2019s based on the historic, bloody battle between Chinese warlords Xiang Yu and Liu Bang, but Yang and her designer Tim Yip have distilled the material down to images of hallucinatory beauty. Yip\u2019s set is constructed from a dense, clanking mass of steel scissors that hang over the stage like storm clouds \u2013 or like a distant, gathering army. They catch the light in extraordinary ways; burnished into a hard angry gold, dark with the smoke of battle or reduced at the end to gaunt silhouettes, framing the stage as drifts of blood-red feathers fall softly over the bodies of the dead. Yang\u2019s choreography looks more traditional, but while rooted in the language of Chinese folk dance it also veers towards extremes of stark expressionism and quasi-balletic virtuosity, mirroring the dramatic range of the score. The battle scenes are extraordinary, with a chorus of black-clad dancers somersaulting, backflipping and whirling in the cross currents of war: Qiu Jirong as the narrator reacts to the grim course of history with a refined, shuddering dread. All the principal dancers are male and among them, Hu Shenyuan is outstanding as the self-sacrificial concubine Yu Ling. He moves with an eerie suppleness, the delicate, voluptuous coils of his body evoking a rare hot-house beauty. His farewell duet with his defeated lover is infinitely, exquisitely sad. That duet, however, is one of the few moments when we engage with the characters\u2019 emotions, or even when we are certain what is happening. Yang\u2019s storyline is familiar to Chinese audiences but there are few signposts to help the unknowing westerner. No surtitles are provided for the narrators\u2019 long speeches and, far more problematically, the highly stylised nature of the action offers little narrative exposition. Much of this two-hour production is frankly impenetrable, and despite the sweep and beauty of its imagery, it\u2019s not an evening for the faint-hearted or unprepared.

"14||MPs condemn newspaper attacks on judges after Brexit rulingThe refusal of the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, to defend three senior judges from \u201cthe vitriol\u201d of sustained media attacks following the Brexit judgment has been condemned by Lord Falconer, who previously held the post. The former Labour cabinet minister asked why Truss, who is also justice secretary, remained silent in the face of personal denunciations in the rightwing, pro-Brexit papers. The Daily Mail described the judges \u2013 the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales \u2013 as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. The Daily Telegraph carried front-page pictures of them with the headline: \u201cThe judges versus the people.\u201d Their judgment on Thursday declared that only parliament has the legal power to trigger article 50, which would initiate Brexit. Writing in the Guardian, Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor between 2003 and 2007, said: \u201cThe British public continues to have confidence in the independence and quality of judges. But both are undermined by this Brexit-inspired media vitriol. \u201cThe lord chancellor, Liz Truss, has a constitutional duty to defend the judges. She needs to make it clear immediately the government has no quarrel with the judges and has total confidence in them. \u201cDisagreement with the judges is dealt with by appeal not by abuse. Liz Truss\u2019s silence feeds the sense the government is either hopeless at avoiding conflict or couldn\u2019t care less about the constitution.\u201d Labour\u2019s justice spokesman, Richard Burgon MP, also urged Truss, to uphold the independence of the judiciary in the face of \u201chysterical headlines \u2026 Some of the headlines in today\u2019s newspapers personally attacking the judges who heard this case are unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cAs lord chancellor, Liz Truss should not stay silent. It is the lord chancellor\u2019s job to uphold the independence of British judges and she must speak out urgently against the hysterical headlines of some papers and these attacks on British justice.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: \u201cWhere is Liz Truss? Her job is to uphold the rule of law and defend the judiciary and yet she is utterly silent while judges are being attacked by some newspapers. Our hard-fought rights and freedoms are protected by the law, British law that the Brexiteers claim that they wish to uphold.\u201d Truss is under a statutory obligation to defend the independence of the judiciary, the solicitor and legal blogger David Allen Green has pointed out. Section 3(6) of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 sets out the lord chancellor\u2019s duty to protect judicial independence. Asked whether Truss wished to comment, the Ministry of Justice said she would not be making a statement. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman refused to condemn the language, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think the British judiciary is being undermined.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not commenting on newspaper coverage.\u201d Brendan Cox, widower of the Labour MP Jo Cox, cautioned against allowing the tone of the debate about Thursday\u2019s judgment to become too febrile. He tweeted: \u201cWhatever our views on the court ruling I hope we can take a step back &amp; debate it soberly. Inciting hatred has consequences.\u201d Jo Cox, who represented the Batley and Spen constituency, was killed in the run-up to the EU referendum. During the high court Brexit case the claimants challenging the ministers\u2019 right to trigger Brexit received death threats and online abuse. The term \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, coined in Roman times, was adopted by Robespierre during the French Revolution and was later favoured by Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Politicians from the three main parties leapt to the defence of the judges. A former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, expressed alarm at attacks on the judiciary. \u201cThey are entirely unjustified and are either made in ignorance or out of malice, it\u2019s impossible to know which,\u201d he said. \u201cThe judges are the safeguarders of our unwritten constitution. Nothing they have done ought to take anybody by surprise. To accede to the principle that you can change primary legislation by royal prerogative is a constitutional monstrosity and would totally undermine everything that our forebears struggled to give us. It would trash the constitution.\u201d The Conservative chair of the Commons justice select committee, Bob Neill, and Anna Soubry MP, a barrister, also condemned the headlines. She described the coverage in a tweet as: \u201cHysterical, dangerously inaccurate &amp; bullying\u201d. Jonathan Marks, the Liberal Democrat justice spokesman, said: \u201cThe headlines in much of the press today and the anti-judge rhetoric from some politicians is extremely worrying. This hostility to the rule of law is irresponsible; the personal attacks on judges are plain nasty. \u201cBritish citizens won our freedoms from the tyranny of the crown painfully and over many centuries. The rights of minorities to think as they will, to live at peace and to claim the protection of the law against an over-mighty state are at stake here.\u201d Lord Macdonald of River Glaven QC, a former director of public prosecutions, said: \u201cThese are risible and constitutionally illiterate attacks from politicians who should know better. The high court has reaffirmed the sovereignty of parliament within the rule of law. In other words, it has fulfilled precisely its most critical function in a democratic society. The idea that judges would be better employed kowtowing to the executive is shameful heresy from political pygmies.\u201d Chantal-Aim\u00e9e Doerries QC, the chair of the Bar Council, which represents barristers across England and Wales, said: \u201cPublicly criticising individual members of the judiciary over a particular judgment or suggesting that they are motivated by their individual views, political or otherwise, is wrong, and serves only to undermine their vital role in the administration of justice.\u201d The Welsh Assembly announced on Friday that it would seek permission to intervene in the anticipated supreme court hearing in which the government will appeal against the high court ruling. Announcing the Welsh government\u2019s involvement, Mick Antoniw, an assembly member and counsel general for Wales, said he would raise concerns about the impact of Theresa May\u2019s attempt to use royal prerogative powers on the devolved assembly."
"0||A musical tour of Europe\u2019s great cities: AmsterdamOK, my friends, I accept I may have made an error of judgment by making a musical stopover in Amsterdam. @abkquan puts it very nicely: \u201cHere the problem is the opposite to Vienna: what to include instead of what to exclude.\u201d The Netherlands is a nation of performers \u2013 and painters of course \u2013 but composers are thin on the ground. It doesn\u2019t have its equivalent of Sibelius, Nielsen or Grieg, a composer who came to symbolise 19th-century nationhood. I feel there is probably a good PhD thesis to be written explaining why. But we have made our bed and now must lie in it. The great thing about @abkquan is that he does not give up. \u201cI\u2019ll tentatively put forward Louis Andriessen, whose pungent De Staat is widely considered a minimalist masterpiece.\u201d De Staat is a setting of and commentary on Plato\u2019s Republic, and has been brilliantly deconstructed by Guardian writer Tom Service. Immerse yourself in it, and you will find yourself perplexed, inspired, seduced. I was also fascinated by Andriessen\u2019s De Stijl, which Service describes as \u201ca boogie-woogie tone-poem inspired by Piet Mondrian\u2019s work\u201d. De Stijl is the third element in De Materie (Matter), Andriessen\u2019s four-part exploration of life, the universe and everything, which was composed in the 1980s. Service considers it his masterpiece. Andriessen\u2019s radicalism stems from his democratic philosophy of music-making. In that sense, he is a typical child of the 1960s in Holland, which was at the forefront of the cultural revolution that swept the world at that time. He does not favour one musical form over another. He reveres Stravinsky, but also adores Count Basie: you can hear both in his syncopated, jazz-inflected scores. The fact that the Netherlands does not have a great musical tradition freed up Andriessen and his fellow Dutch modernists. They had to construct their own musical landscape. They faced what they saw as the conservatism of Dutch orchestras, especially the great Royal Concertgebouw orchestra in Amsterdam. In the late 60s \u2013 the era of sit-ins and assorted happenings \u2013 Andriessen and Co were happy to disrupt performances by the Concertgebouw to further their demands for more adventurous programming, apparently letting loose toy frogs in the middle of concerts. Those were the days! I rather like the idea of Mahler\u2019s Third Symphony, say, played to an accompaniment of the croaking of an army of toy frogs. Another Dutch modernist of Andriessen\u2019s vintage (and 60s enfant terrible status) is Reinbert de Leeuw, who broke a 40-year (!) compositional silence in 2014 with Der n\u00e4chtlige Wanderer, a wonderfully haunting piece (complete with barking dog) that was given its UK premiere at the Proms last summer. De Leeuw \u2013 teacher, pianist, composer, musicologist \u2013 is, like Andriessen, a gloriously unclassifiable figure, but he is certainly very Dutch in his intellectualised view of music and the inspiration he draws from other art forms \u2013 Der n\u00e4chtlige Wanderer is inspired by a Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin poem. Now we start struggling. @thesecretorganist offers Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck\u2019s organ music, though he doesn\u2019t sound entirely convinced. \u201cThe first piece by Sweelinck I ever heard was a wonderful little jewel called Hodie Christus Natus Est,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s still my favourite of his pieces, although I wouldn\u2019t say it sounds particularly evocative of Amsterdam.\u201d Sweelinck is an important figure in Europe\u2019s musical evolution, but a somewhat recherch\u00e9 one \u2013 a late 16th-century organist and teacher who was probably the finest keyboard player in Europe before Bach and helped open the way for the emergence of baroque styles of playing. He also composed many keyboard and vocal works. In Holland\u2019s flat musical landscape he stands out as a giant. @abkquan offers Alphons Diepenbrock, a composer and conductor who swam successfully in the cross-currents of late 19th-century musical life, effecting a sort of marriage of Wagner, Mahler and Debussy. He was particularly noted for his song settings. H\u00f6lderlin clearly appeals to the Dutch spirit, because his poem Die Nacht is one of Diepenbrock\u2019s most notable compositions. @abkquan is also keen for us to listen to Im Grossen Schweigen, a tone poem for baritone and orchestra drawing on the composer\u2019s interest in Nietzsche. One other Dutch composer worth mentioning, though the Amsterdam connection is weak, is Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer, an 18th-century noble and diplomat whose amateur compositions are extremely enjoyable, especially his Concerti Armonici, which until 1980 were thought to be the work of Pergolesi. Van Wassenaer was his own severest critic and did not want the concerti published \u2013 one reason for a succession of misattributions over the next two centuries. \u201cSome of them are tolerable, some middling, others wretched,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHad they not been published, I would perhaps have corrected the mistakes in them, but other business has left me no leisure to amuse myself with them, and I would have caused their editor offence.\u201d Despite these intriguing individual composers, the real strength of Dutch music lies not in composition but in performance. The Concertgebouw has been one of the great musical forces in Europe since its foundation in 1888, and has formed long relationships with some of the world\u2019s finest conductors: Willem Mengelberg for the little matter of 50 years; Bernard Haitink for almost 30; Riccardo Chailly and Mariss Jansons for more than a decade each. In its hall, the Concertgebouw, it also has one of the most evocative venues in the world, once experienced never forgotten. As @fleetfootkid notes, Holland\u2019s contribution to period performance has also been considerable over the past 50 years, thanks in particular to recorder player and conductor Frans Br\u00fcggen and organist, harpsichordist and conductor Ton Koopman, both wonderful players who combined a quest for authentic performance with a raw energy that communicated itself to a wide public. All then is not lost for Amsterdam and for the Netherlands generally. It may not be Vienna, but it has done its bit and I will (almost) defend myself from the accusation by @Repons that this was an odd choice. If all else fails in the case for my defence, there is always \u2013 as @fleetfootkid points out \u2013 the theme music to Van der Valk, the 1970s ITV detective show set in Amsterdam. The Van der Valk theme was written by Dutch composer Jan Stoeckart (masquerading under the pseudonym of Jack Trombey), and got to number one in the UK charts in 1973, which is more than Beethoven ever managed. Next time we\u2019ll look at Berlin, the last stop in our post-referendum series on European cities. All musical associations gratefully received. I\u2019m assuming this is going to be a little less challenging than our tour of Amsterdam, though in the end I found the quirks of this week\u2019s journey rather engaging. Thanks to those who offered signposts. Previous cities in this series: London | Paris | Venice | Helsinki | Prague | Hamburg | Rome | Vienna"
"17||US adds 161,000 new jobs as Americans head to the pollsThe US economy added 161,000 jobs in October, the final jobs report before the election. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.9%. The figure was below the 175,000 economists had forecast for the month but August\u2019s jobs number was revised up to 176,000 from 167,000, and September was revised to 191,000 from 156,000. Wage growth accelerated to its strongest pace since the recession. Though much of the electoral discussion has hinged on the economic woes of the middle class, the latest figures were broadly inline with expectations and are unlikely to affect the election itself this close to the opening of the polls on Tuesday. Labor secretary Thomas Perez said he believed continuing growth in the healthcare sector in particular was due to the passage of the controversial Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. \u201cThe folks who said the Affordable Care Act was going to be a job-killer aren\u2019t looking at the data,\u201d Perez said. \u201cAs the ACA has really kicked in over the last two years we\u2019ve seen solid job growth in the hospital sector as well. More people are using healthcare.\u201d \u201cThe three-month moving average of job growth was 176,000, about double the pace needed to keep up with underlying growth in the labor force, allowing for a continued diminishment of labor market slack,\u201d said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist with PNC. Hoffman noted that the labor force participation rate \u2013 the number of people in work or actively seeking employment \u2013 fell slightly. Perhaps the most encouraging number was a rise in average hourly earnings, which climbed 0.4% in October, and were up 2.8% from a year earlier, the fastest pace since June 2009. As the job market gets tighter, firms are responding to tougher competition for workers by raising pay. This is a big positive for income growth, consumer spending, and the overall economy. \u201cWorkers have been looking for a raise for some time,\u201d Perez said. \u201cThey deserve that raise and they\u2019re getting that raise, and that\u2019s good news.\u201d Though he is not allowed to comment on the election, Perez said he hoped for the passage of ballot measures increasing the minimum wage in four states: Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington. Though state initiatives could improve wages locally, Perez blamed Republicans \u201cstonewalling on common-sense legislation that\u2019s usually been bipartisan\u201d for the gridlock on the Federal minimum wage, frozen at what he called a too-low $7.25 an hour.\u201cPeople understand that seven and a quarter an hour is not enough to feed your family,\u201d he said. \u201cObama will be only the third president since FDR signed the Fair Labor Standards Act not to increase the minimum wage,\u201d Perez said. \u201cThat\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d Some 8.65m jobs have been added under Barack Obama during his second term, 1.3m during his first. At its height in October of 2010 after the Bush-era housing market collapse, unemployment stood at a full 10% of the US workforce. The number is now less than half that. The question of the quality of job growth has been paramount this year: in October food service was the biggest growth area, a traditionally lower-paid industry where benefits are scarce. The healthcare sector added 31,000 jobs in October, the month\u2019s fastest growing sector. Retail lost 1,100 over the month, a surprise drop in a month when retail jobs usually start picking up. The report once again highlighted the uneven nature of the US jobs market: Hispanic unemployment declined to 5.7% but rates for most other groups showed little change. African American unemployment was steady at 8.6%. The number of long-term unemployed was unchanged at 2 million and accounted for more than a quarter of the total unemployed. Growth in the healthcare sector has long been expected as baby boomers age in the US \u2013 indeed, \u201cpopulation aging is accelerating rapidly worldwide\u201d, according to a report from professional services firm Deloitte on the expected state of the industry in 2016. \u201cIn higher-income countries, increasing life expectancy is mainly due to declining mortality among those who are older.\u201d The report is likely to strengthen the Federal Reserve\u2019s resolve to raise rates at its next meeting in December. Growth is not as rapid as Wall Street would like, but with October stronger than September, the case for increasing the interest rate is better than it might have been. \u201cThis solid jobs report \u2013 good job growth, a decline in labor market slack, and a pickup in wage growth \u2013 is a green light for an increase in the fed funds rate at the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s [meeting] December 13 and 14,\u201d wrote Hoffman."
"14||Sun on Sunday publisher to pay out to celebrity over kiss'n'tellThe publishers of the Sun on Sunday have agreed in the high court to pay an undisclosed sum of damages and costs to a celebrity who fought to keep his name out of a tabloid \u201ckiss\u2019n\u2019tell\u201d following a three-way sexual encounter. The agreement ends months of litigation over attempts by the celebrity, known only as PJS, to block News Group Newspapers (NGN) from revealing his identity. The case ended up being heard by the highest court in the land. As part of the agreement, NGN has agreed to remove some articles and not to use, disclose or publish certain information, including details that might lead to the identification of PJS as the claimant in the case, including identifying his partner or three others. PJS is said to have had an extramarital affair with another couple four years ago. The couple approached the Sun on Sunday in January this year and told reporters about the relationship. The paper, which planned to publish the story, contacted PJS\u2019s lawyers, initiating the courtroom dispute. In January, NGN won the first round of litigation when a high court judge refused to impose an injunction. But appeal judges reversed this decision, and the case went to the supreme court. In May, the supreme court ruled that the Sun on Sunday should be barred from revealing PJS\u2019s identity. It said the information was private, there was no public interest in its disclosure and, while secrecy and confidentiality may have been compromised by publicity, a court was unlikely to find that PJS\u2019s right to privacy was defeated by that fact. Delivering the court\u2019s judgment by a four-to-one majority, Lord Mance said there was no public interest in naming PJS, and revealing details of the affair would breach the family\u2019s privacy. He said: \u201cPublication of the story would infringe privacy rights of PJS, his partner and their children \u2026 There is no public interest, however much it may be of interest to some members of the public, in publishing kiss\u2019n\u2019tell stories or criticisms of private sexual conduct, simply because the persons involved are well-known; and so there is no right to invade privacy by publishing them. \u201cIt is different if the story has some bearing on the performance of a public office or the correction of a misleading public impression cultivated by the person involved. But \u2026 that does not apply here.\u201d Referring to the fact that many of the details had already been published online, Mance said: \u201cIt is true the story has been accessible on the internet and social media but if the injunction were to be lifted, there would be intensive coverage of the story by the Sun on Sunday \u2013 and there is little doubt, by other newspapers \u2013 as well as unrestricted internet and social media coverage, all of which could constitute additional and potentially more enduring invasions of the privacy of PJS, his partner and their children.\u201d At the high court in London on Friday, Mr Justice Warby said PJS and NGN had agreed a final order in the action for breach of confidence and misuse of private information. The proceedings were stayed on the basis that NGN pay a specified sum in full and final settlement of PJS\u2019s claim for damages and costs. The judge said: \u201cI accept the undertakings offered by the defendant, which are clear and plainly given on advice. I see no reason not to make an order for payment of the agreed sum. There is no reason not to allow the parties to keep the figure confidential.\u201d Dr Evan Harris, of the campaign group Hacked Off, praised the agreement as a \u201cmassive climbdown\u201d for the Sun on Sunday, adding: \u201cThe real issue here, however, is what would happen to the everyday victims of press intrusion that Hacked Off works with \u2013 the vast majority of press victims, who do not have the deep pockets needed to take on the Murdoch press and other large newspaper groups who would trample over their rights.\u201d The privacy lawyer Amber Melville-Brown, of Withers, said: \u201cSometimes an injunction is the only way to go. Once the privacy kitty cat is out of the bag, it\u2019s a tough job to stuff her back in again. Free speech? Yes; but not at all costs. Let\u2019s all be a bit sensible here, and accept that we are not entitled to know everything about everyone all the time. And nor should we want to.\u201d Kate Macmillan, a privacy lawyer at Collyer Bristow, said the law had changed over the past decade to protect serious journalism, adding: \u201cThis is about something completely different. It\u2019s about the commercial underpinning of tabloid newspapers.\u201d The supreme court case, she said, had established that there was \u201cno public interest in celebrity sexual tittle-tattle\u201d. But Bob Satchwell, the executive director of the Society of Editors, said the secrecy surrounding the case risked undermining public confidence in open justice. \u201cThe circumstances surrounding this case must leave the public baffled,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does the law and justice system no favours because it undermines public confidence. Open justice is a key principle of any mature democratic society. It should not be a plaything for individuals and expensive lawyers.\u201d The supreme court decision was criticised in May by the senior barrister Lord Lester, who wrote that press regulators, not the courts, should be responsible for upholding the privacy code of practice. He said: \u201cUsing the courts to rule on freely available celebrity tittle-tattle abuses our hard-fought freedoms and leaves the judges and the law looking foolish and diminished.\u201d Timeline January A couple approach the Sun on Sunday with details of their relationship with a \u201cwell-known\u201d married individual, subsequently referred to in a legal judgment by the initials PJS. The paper contacts PJS\u2019s lawyers, initiating a courtroom dispute as he seeks to prevent reporting about his alleged extramarital affair. 22 January In an anonymised judgment, the court of appeal rules that the Sun on Sunday cannot publish the story because PJS, who has an \u201copen relationship\u201d, had an expectation that his sexual encounters would remain private. 11 April A Scottish newspaper prints the identities of the couple who took the injunction stating that it is doing so in order to champion free speech and freedom of the press. It followed details of the story being published in a US newspaper. 15 April The Guardian and other media organisations win the right to report on the appeal hearing, which raised the issue of whether injunctions restricting reporting can be enforced in the era of the internet. Judges delay their decision on whether to lift the injunction. 18 April News Group Newspapers, publishers of the Sun and its sister Sunday title, win an application to have the injunction lifted, after telling the court earlier that the celebrity had already been named so widely online and in publications in the US and Scotland that the injunction was effectively redundant and unenforceable. 19 April The injunction banning the media naming the celebrity involved in an extramarital affair is extended for another two days by the supreme court. Lawyers for PJS succeed in having their claim fast-tracked to the supreme court in Westminster, which decides the case is important enough to have a hearing later in the week. 19 May The supreme court rules that the interim injunction will not be lifted."
"8||People of colour are painfully absent from our museums. Let\u2019s change thatThe German artist Hans Haacke wrote that \u201cmuseums are managers of consciousness\u201d giving us \u201can interpretation of history, of how to view the world and locate ourselves in it.\u201d If you are a black and minority ethnic (BAME) attendee, what is painfully obvious is our absence in these public cultural spaces. That is, of course, if you don\u2019t count our presence as security staff. Last week the print and online magazine collective, gal-dem, curated an event that was nothing short of breathtaking at The V&amp;A in London. People of colour, in their thousands, confidently walked through the corridors and display rooms of a museum established to show off the booty of empire. For once we could gather in such a space and view it not as a diminishment of our value, but rather a celebration of our worth. As part of the The V&amp;A\u2019s Friday Late programme, the collective treated visitors to contemporary work being made by young people of colour. For the editor-in-chief and founder of gal-dem, Liv Little, the collective \u201cwanted to fill this space with a spread of work that is reflective of different lived experiences \u2026 with art forms that are not static but instead interactive.\u201d Work that is, in short, \u201cnever seen in traditional museum and gallery spaces\u201d. You could listen to the young women spearheading grime music in the grand entrance, or twerk to empowerment in the lecture theatre, or immerse yourself through dance in the culture of queer and trans women of colour, or listen to discussion on how we manage careers in arts, music and politics. By the museum\u2019s own estimation, more than 4,000 people turned up to take up space both as a celebration and an act of resistance. The majority of them being people of colour because here was art for us, by us. We strolled through exuding a sense of triumph and satisfaction that comes with taking what is rightfully yours. A day after gal-dem\u2019s historic takeover, Museum Detox, a group of BAME museum workers, staged a flashmob at the Museum of London. Sara Wajid, founder of the group and head of interpretation at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, organised the event to declare that \u201cwe exist and we want to see more people like us in museums.\u201d It stands to reason that if you see yourself reflected in this arena of high art and culture, then it will feel less austere an environment. Conversations around the low participation levels of BAME people in these public centres of culture and debate are not new. Periodically appearing in well-researched reports that are the paper copy of pointless hand-wringing, they fade into the general hum, part of the whirr of things we could do much better on. But, as Wajid points out, museums and galleries are public spaces, funded by taxpayers. If, as people of colour, we do not find ourselves reflected in them, then we are allowed to call the situation unjust. What gal-dem\u2019s event highlighted so brilliantly was how the public conversations about ourselves and our history do not give us the whole story. Many of us do not see ourselves in the works on display and when we do, it is often a painful reflection. The British Museum has for so long consigned its Africa and Pacific collections to the basement of the building. If there was ever a visual metaphor for the abasement of cultures and traditions, then this sorry space is it. Who wants to enter a space that at its very core feels uninviting? Galleries, and museums in particular, are the last remaining free spaces where we can conduct a national dialogue about what constitutes culture and art. Yet there are obvious absences and silences that betray a narrative that is not true for all. A cultural shift is taking place at the moment. Fact. Collectives like gal-dem are evidence of that. \u201cOutsider art\u201d is now accessible on digital platforms such as Instagram and emerging artists are finding innovative ways of showcasing their work. Museums, as custodians of the collection for the past and future, will have to take great care in ensuring they don\u2019t become obsolete for the generation of cultural consumers to come."
"6||From one Vladimir to another: Putin unveils huge statue in MoscowThere is now a Vladimir inside the Kremlin and one standing just outside. On Friday, the Kremlin\u2019s current incumbent, Vladimir Putin, unveiled a monument a stone\u2019s throw from its gates to Prince Vladimir the Great, calling on Russians to unite to face external threats as his namesake did a millennium ago. The 17-metre monument(56ft) monument to Vladimir, the 10th-century ruler of Kievan Rus who adopted Orthodox Christianity for his people, has caused controversy owing to both its size and the political implications of claiming for Russia a figure whom both Russia and Ukraine believe to be the founder of their states. Vladimir is believed to have had several wives and hundreds of concubines, but is best known for his adoption of Orthodox Christianity in 988. \u201cHe laid the moral foundation on which our lives are still based today. It was a strong moral bearing, solidarity and unity which helped our ancestors overcome difficulties and win victories for the glory of the fatherland, making it stronger and greater with each generation,\u201d Putin said at the unveiling. \u201cToday it is our duty to stand together against contemporary challenges and threats, using our spiritual legacy and our invaluable traditions of unity to go forward and continue our thousand-year history.\u201d The president was joined by the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and Russian religious leaders at the ceremony. Initially, the monument was meant to overlook Moscow from a hilltop in the south-west of the city, but after protests that it would ruin the cityscape, its location was moved to just outside the Kremlin walls and its height was reduced. The state Vladimir ruled over, Kievan Rus, later disintegrated, and both modern-day Ukraine and Russia consider him the founder of their states. In speeches at the ceremony, neither Putin nor the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox church used the word \u201cKiev\u201d, although the patriarch alluded to the discord between Russia and Ukraine by saying Vladimir\u2019s descendants currently lived in many countries, and \u201cit\u2019s bad if the children forget that they have the same father\u201d. Russian state television repeatedly announced the Moscow statue as \u201cthe first monument to Vladimir the Great\u201d, ignoring the fact that one already stands in Kiev. Ukraine gave an acerbic response on the country\u2019s official Twitter account, posting a photograph of the Kiev monument and using the Ukrainian spelling of Prince Vladimir. Friday is the Day of National Unity in Russia, a post-Soviet holiday that has failed to capture public imagination but is strongly promoted by authorities. State television broadcast footage of a concert in central Moscow, while the anchor told viewers that Russia was historically only strong when it was united. The Vladimir statue is the latest in a flurry of recent memorialisations in Russia. Last month a monument to the 16th-century tsar Ivan the Terrible was unveiled in the town of Oryol, prompting a nationwide debate over the role of the monarch, who killed his own son and set up a ruthless personal guard to terrorise his internal enemies, but also expanded Russia\u2019s borders."
"1||Brexit: May tells Merkel and Juncker timetable remains the sameTheresa May has reassured Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker that she is determined to stick to her timetable of triggering article 50 to leave the EU by the end of March, despite a high court judgment that could delay her plans. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that in phone calls this morning, she had confirmed to the German chancellor and European commission president respectively that the government would appeal against the judgment to the supreme court, and still expected to be able to meet her self-imposed deadline. \u201cShe confirmed that the timetable remains the same,\u201d the spokesman said, adding that May was expected to repeat that message in separate calls to the European council president, Donald Tusk, and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, later on Friday. \u201cWhile the government is disappointed by the judgment, we remain of the firm belief that we have a strong legal argument ahead of the case, which is moving to the supreme court next month.\u201d He refused to be drawn on what, if any, contingency plans the government was making in case it lost the appeal. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, said on Thursday he accepted that losing the case would force the government to pass a bill through both houses of parliament before article 50 could be triggered \u2013 a potentially lengthy process. \u201cThe focus at the moment is very much on the supreme court: winning that case, and proceeding with triggering article 50,\u201d he said. The European commission has declined to comment on possible delays to Britain\u2019s exit that may result from Thursday\u2019s high court ruling. The call between Juncker and May lasted between five and 10 minutes. \u201cIt was a rather short phone call,\u201d a commission spokeswoman said. \u201cShe informed him of the situation following the high court decision of yesterday. The president appreciated the prime minister\u2019s call and he repeated his respect for the legal and constitutional order of the United Kingdom.\u201d The commission declined to comment on delays to article 50: \u201cThis is now a British affair, the timing is in the hands of the British authorities.\u201d In a separate development, the Welsh assembly announced that it would seek permission to intervene in the government\u2019s appeal against the ruling, further complicating the Brexit process. Announcing the Welsh government\u2019s involvement, Mick Antoniw, an assembly member and counsel general for Wales, said he would raise concerns about May\u2019s attempt to use royal prerogative powers to trigger Brexit. Welsh representations consider the impact on \u201cthe legislative competence of the national assembly for Wales, the powers of Welsh ministers, the legal and constitutional relationships of the assembly to parliament and the social and economic impact on Wales\u201d. The Scottish government was also considering whether to join in the case."
"1||'I am fed up with the elite ignoring us': leave voters on article 50 rulingThe high court has decided that MPs must have a vote on triggering Brexit. Three senior judges ruled on Thursday that the government could not press ahead with its plans to begin the formal process of departing the EU without first consulting MPs and peers. Some have argued that this is a breach of democracy, and that the decision has been made and it\u2019s now up to the government to set the timetable for our departure. However, others believe this is an opportunity to scrutinise further Theresa May\u2019s plans. How do those who voted leave feel about the ruling? Here, a group of Brexiters explain. Thomson Parker-Jarvis, 59, from Sheffield: \u2018I am fed up of the so-called elite not listening to us\u2019 I am old enough to remember when we joined the EU and it was sold then as us entering the common market. But I believe they knew from the start that they wanted it to be something else: a superstate, which I have never agreed with. Finally, we were given the chance to vote on our membership in a referendum and people made their decision clear: we want control of our own destiny. However, clearly the political elite think we are too stupid to make this choice, something they\u2019ve been telling us for the past year, and I take unkindly to that. The tone is that we\u2019ve made a mistake and they want to resist it. They want us to stay in, but it will never work. I am talking as someone who has travelled Europe and spoken to people in other countries who are similarly disillusioned: they want the common market but to remain independent countries. People want to discuss the terms of Brexit but the truth is that Theresa May must go and negotiate that. Stalling the decision will change nothing, we need to just sit down and talk to our European neighbours about our options. The court ruling will just make getting on with this 10 times harder. I have never been a protester but if Brexit was stopped by putting obstacles in its way then I, and a lot of other people, would take to streets. People are fed up with not being listened to. We are fed up of the so-called elite not listening to us and we suffer. They gave us a vote, and we voted. As May says: \u201cOut is out, so let\u2019s get out.\u201d Sarah Newton, 47, from Northampton: \u2018Having a government dictated by legislators is like going back in time\u2019 I have no issue with immigration, that was not my reason for voting leave. I voted for Brexit to escape the bureaucracy of the European Union and I wanted us to regain control over legislation in this country. The latest ruling is yet more evidence for why this was the right decision. The country should not be ruled by any court system \u2013 including any European courts \u2013 and I am now more determined than ever to go. It\u2019s dreadful that democracy can be overturned in court by law. I am not sure what I would do if Brexit was blocked. Everyone who votes leave gets grouped together as racist bigots, but that\u2019s not true for the majority. I wouldn\u2019t protest as I wouldn\u2019t want to be put in that bracket, but I wouldn\u2019t keep quiet either. To me court system overruling democracy is dangerous \u2013 I cannot believe it can even happen, remainers should be worried about this too. Some may argue that this decision will just force Theresa May to be more transparent about her plans, or perhaps trigger another election. However, the fact that the court has any say in what happens next is worrying. Why do we have democracy if we then don\u2019t listen to the will of the people? Having a government dictated by legislators is like going back in time. It feels difficult to get my head around this. Hamzah Bawkher, 35, from London: \u2018The UK can recover from any impacts of Brexit more quickly if we get on with it\u2019 When the referendum started, I was in the remain camp, but my opinion gradually shifted because of certain things, such as how the European Union treated Greece. People talk about remaining for unity but they weren\u2019t very supportive of the Greeks. I also voted for more transparency and feel the EU needs a lot of reform. I had some voter\u2019s remorse when I woke up the next day but now I stand by my decision. A lot needs to be sorted out to make it work, but leaving is the best way forward. I am, however, in favour of a soft Brexit, not a hard one. I find the court ruling this week really strange. If you have a referendum and then don\u2019t listen to the result \u2013 then what was the point of holding it in the first place? Was it just a polling exercise? I feel frustrated and confused because all these setbacks are just causing more economic confusion. The UK can recover from any of the impacts of Brexit more quickly if we just get on with it. I agree that the terms of leaving should be discussed, but we need to approach it from the standpoint that Brexit is definitely happening. Anonymous: \u2018Blocking Brexit would be absolutely disastrous for democracy\u2019 As a leave voter enamoured of British democracy, I welcome the court judgment on the supremacy of parliament. This was a decision made by British judges, in accordance with the law, by due process. It is one of the things I voted for. I am, though, glad that the confirmation of parliamentary supremacy has taken some time to achieve. In the immediate aftermath of the vote, far too many foolish MPs were talking of defying the vote or a second referendum to get the \u201ccorrect\u201d result. That would have been \u2013 and would still be \u2013 absolutely catastrophic. There are still those who seem to take this line of knowing better than the electorate, but I trust wiser heads will prevail. Leaving the EU while retaining some degree of access to the single market, together with whatever concessions on free movement are required to secure this, is the only way forward. Blocking Brexit altogether, especially if that block was perceived to come from inside the Labour party, would be absolutely disastrous for democracy. I trust that anyone who defies Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s eminently sensible line on the Brexit vote in the Houses of Parliament \u2013 if the court of appeal confirms it is necessary \u2013 will lose the Labour whip immediately, and that the party can go into the expected general election uncontaminated by such foolishness."
"21||Nadiya Hussain\u2019s cod and clementine recipeCod and clementine is one of the things my grandmother cooked for my mum when she was a child. Never one for waste, she\u2019d keep the peel whenever she had a clementine, and this dish puts it to work. Mum learned to cook it from my gran and now I cook it for my children. They say it\u2019s their favourite. My grandmother spent a lot of time with us when we were growing up. She did the school runs and fed us when my mum was busy. To be with her was to really be at home. We lived in a three-bed terrace house in Luton, which backed on to train tracks. It was very noisy. We knew all the trains that passed and what time to expect them. I was one of six children, and lots of extended family lived nearby, so people were always popping in. They\u2019d turn up and stay for dinner. That meant always cooking large quantities of everything. You never knew who was going to come by and you didn\u2019t want to be that person who didn\u2019t have enough food. Things have changed now \u2013 I don\u2019t have that many people coming unannounced for dinner. But I can promise tea and cake... and people do just turn up and ask for it! Nowadays I live in a modern grey house, where everything has its place. I like tidy, clean lines, and I don\u2019t like clutter or mess; I learned early on that the way to achieve that is to not have anything. Growing up, our home was old-fashioned and cluttered: lots of prints and colours and mismatched linen. My dad\u2019s an amazing photographer, and he loves a Sunday market. So the house was full of all the stuff he\u2019d buy, and frame. He\u2019d know if a piece went missing. He has a photographic memory when it comes to his tat. We\u2019d spend every weekend dusting it all. We always had the cosiest carpets \u2013 I can still feel it between my toes. My older sister had reflux as a baby, so my father spent the first two years of her life changing all the carpets every six months. And when that was over, he treated the house to plush carpets. With the six of us to look after, my mum had virtually no time to herself \u2013 so she kind of just went with the flow. She has always been a fabulous cook with magic hands, and makes everything from scratch. No microwaves, no fish fingers. She and my grandmother would work in the kitchen together and we could watch, but we weren\u2019t allowed to help. Cod and clementine is one of the dishes I remember them doing. Eating it is one of my earliest memories of being astonished by flavour. My mum would normally cook this dish with whole pieces of fish. None of this \u201ceasy fish\u201d, as my dad likes to call it \u2013 it was always cooked with all the bones still in to boost the flavour. We would spend a long time picking it apart to eat, putting the bones a safe distance away from our plates. Traditionally we\u2019d eat it with our hands (it\u2019s near impossible with cutlery). Although it was delicious, these days there isn\u2019t always time to sit at our plates for an hour, and I am a big fan of filleted fish for convenience\u2019s sake. Granted, it imparts less flavour to this dish \u2013 but the clementine peel well and truly makes up for that. My own kids are absolutely allowed to help me cook it. They of course have the added bonus of knowing how to bake. That wasn\u2019t really a concept when I was a kid \u2013 I learned it at school in home economics, then started properly when I was home with my children. They love helping me. Cod and clementine Serves 2 5 tbsp olive oil 2 garlic cloves, crushed \u00bd onion, diced 1 tbsp tomato puree 1 tsp salt 200ml water \u00bd tsp turmeric 1 tsp paprika 1 tsp ground cumin 2 clementines, peel of both, juice of one 300g cod fillets A handful of coriander, finely chopped Basmati rice, to serve 1 Heat the oil in a medium pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the crushed garlic and diced onion. Turn the heat down and cook gently until the onions are soft. 2 Add the tomato puree, salt and water. Cook for 5 minutes over a low heat. Then add the turmeric, paprika and cumin, and cook for another 5 minutes. Keep adding small amounts of water if it starts to catch on the bottom. 3 Slice the clementine peel and add this to the pan. Cook for 10 minutes, until the peel is soft and almost falling apart, then mash it. 4 Add the fish, cover and cook for 10 minutes over a low heat. 5 Squeeze in the clementine juice. Once the fish is cooked, take the pan off the heat and sprinkle over the chopped coriander. Serve with hot basmati rice. Nadiya Hussain is the winner of last year\u2019s Great British Bake-Off.

"32||Mary Berry to explore UK's stately homes in first post-Bake Off showMary Berry will tour Britain\u2019s stately homes in what is likely to be her first BBC1 outing after The Great British Bake Off moves to Channel 4. In Mary Berry\u2019s Secrets From Britain\u2019s Great Houses, the cooking judge will meet the custodians and staff at some of Britain\u2019s grandest properties, exploring their culinary histories and creating her own recipes. Berry said: \u201cI am so excited to be doing this new series with the BBC. I have always had an inquiring mind, so I know I will be inspired by the great houses we visit.\u201d The BBC\u2019s director of content, Charlotte Moore, said: \u201cThis series will be a real treat for BBC1 viewers.\u201d Berry is to appear in two Bake Off Christmas specials but, along with presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, has said she will not follow the programme \u2013 and fellow judge Paul Hollywood \u2013 to Channel 4. Last month, a new Saturday night entertainment show hosted by Giedroyc and Perkins was announced, weeks after last year\u2019s Bake Off winner, Nadiya Hussain, who had been tipped to become a presenter or judge for Channel 4\u2019s version, committed to making the BBC her home. Channel 4 has been criticised for failing to ensure the show\u2019s most recognisable faces were signed up before agreeing a \u00a325m a year deal with the show\u2019s creators, Love Productions. Berry recently said she would be reunited with Giedroyc and Perkins, joking that they could host a gardening programme together. Tanya Shaw, managing director of Shine TV, producer of Mary Berry\u2019s Secrets From Britain\u2019s Great Houses, said: \u201cFollowing the success of Mary Berry\u2019s Easter Feast last year, we are delighted to be working with Mary on this exciting new series. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone more perfect to tell the stories of these great households and to bring us such a unique insight into Britain\u2019s rich culinary past.\u201d"
"0||David Bowie\u2019s final years to be explored in BBC documentaryPreviously unheard vocals from David Bowie\u2019s final release, Lazarus, and never before seen archive footage of the star will be aired for the first time in a BBC2 documentary covering the last five years of his life. David Bowie: The Last Five Years will revolve around the singer\u2019s final projects \u2013 his last two albums, The Next Day and Blackstar, and musical Lazarus, which recently transferred from Broadway to London. Bowie died on 10 January this year, two days after Blackstar\u2019s surprise release. The documentary will be broadcast in January as part of a series of programmes to coincide with what would have been his 70th birthday. BBC4 will broadcast rarely seen Bowie performances from its archive, Martin Kemp will present a show dedicated to Bowie\u2019s Life on Mars, and 6Music will host a \u201clistening party\u201d for the public\u2019s favourite Bowie album and a tribute show. In The Last Five Years, producer Tony Visconti, who worked with Bowie over a period of more than four decades, describes how the singer recorded Lazarus. \u201cHe would stand in front of the mic and for the four or five minutes he was singing he would pour his heart out,\u201d Visconti says. \u201cI could see through the window he was really feeling it. The audio picked up his breathing, it wasn\u2019t that he was out of breath, he was hyperventilating in a way, getting his energy up to sing this.\u201d Created by Francis Whately, who produced and directed 2013\u2019s David Bowie: Five Years, the film promises unprecedented access to the star\u2019s closest collaborators and friends. It will also visit New York\u2019s 55 bar where Bowie met the jazz quartet who would become his backing band on Blackstar, and interview the director and cast of Lazarus. Whatley said: \u201cI always hoped that I would make another film about Bowie as we were only able to scratch the surface in the first film, but I just didn\u2019t expect it to be this soon. \u201cHowever, looking at Bowie\u2019s extraordinary creativity during the last five years of his life has allowed me to re-examine his life\u2019s work and move beyond the simplistic view that his career was simply predicated on change \u2013 Bowie the chameleon \u2026 \u2018ch ch ch changes\u2019 etc. Instead, I would like to show how the changes were often superficial, but the core themes in his work were entirely consistent \u2013 alienation, mortality and fame.\u201d Adam Barker, channelexecutive for BBC2 and BBC4, said: \u201cBBC2 is thrilled to have commissioned this unique documentary chronicling the most recent achievements of one of the most significant figures in the history of music.\u201d"
"1||Sarah Smith obituaryMy stepsister Sarah Smith, who has died from ovarian cancer aged 52, had a developing career as a politician, a PhD thesis two-thirds completed and a personal life brimming with love. Before illness finally clipped her wings, she spent a last weekend away with her daughters Becky and Elli, and her husband, Robert Seabrook, whom she married in April. In Robert she found a companion who shared her passions and supported her dreams. She also remained close to Barry Smith, her first husband and the father of her girls. Born in London, Sarah grew up in Manchester with her parents, Alison and John Bird, respectively a teacher and an insurance company executive, and sister, Catherine. After her father set up home with my mother, Sarah became a vibrant presence in my life. Educated at Bramhall high school, Stockport, she took a first degree in English and drama at Goldsmiths, University of London. She later gained a second degree in psychology through the Open University, then an MSc at University College London and started her doctorate on financial decision-making. She lived what she assumed to be the first half of her life balancing the needs of her family with work, founding a boutique and a chain of traditional sweet shops, and at the same time holding jobs in Barry\u2019s construction company and later at the Church of England and the Financial Services Authority. When she was sure that her daughters were launched into adulthood, she embarked on her next act, as a public servant. It says a great deal about Sarah\u2019s dynamism that she achieved so much in the few years that remained to her. She fought the 2015 general election as the Liberal Democrats\u2019 candidate for Dover and Deal, Kent. This looked like a doomed enterprise. The party was in bad odour nationally and had never won the seat. Moreover Sarah had been diagnosed with stage-three cancer after winning the nomination. She campaigned tirelessly despite chemotherapy and surgery. She lost, of course, but achieved local victories, and I watched her persuade voters to question Ukip\u2019s xenophobic rhetoric. Her performance impressed colleagues so deeply that she was again selected as a parliamentary candidate in the event of a snap election, despite her worsening health. She confronted illness with the cheerful determination that was her hallmark and worked with the Eve Appeal to advocate prevention and early detection of ovarian cancer, from which her mother had died in 2011. She comforted her family and friends as death approached. \u201cSometimes I just sit and think: here I am, breathing, thinking, writing, talking. I still am. And because I am, I can love and have friendships and find beauty and I can try and set right things I do wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when I am not any more, I always will have been \u2013 and how amazing is that?\u201d Sarah is survived by Robert, Becky and Elli, her sister, Catherine, her father, John, her stepmother and three stepsisters."
"8||A moment that changed me: being abused on the street about my weightAny centre of any city on any Friday or Saturday night has the same vibe. It\u2019s as if there has been a fire at the prick factory and everyone has escaped. I always try to stay away. If I have a standup gig in central London, I leave immediately after the show and get back to my safe bed as soon as I possibly can. Alcohol brings out the worst in some people \u2013 and no one has ever drunkenly told me something I really needed to hear. This happened on a recent Saturday. I had rushed out of a gig and got the tube to Kennington, south London, where I was waiting for my bus. I\u2019d forgotten my headphones so I was hyper-aware of all the drunk people walking the streets, getting on the tube, going into the city centre to seek shelter in nightclubs where the music, fortunately, is so loud that no one can hear them speak, which means they never have to develop personalities. I saw four young men approach. I was not surprised when they spoke \u2013 I expected it. \u201cOi, you fat cunt!\u201d one of them said. \u201cOink oink,\u201d said another. The rest is a blur because I focused on whatever was on my phone. It hurt, of course. As it would have hurt anyone. Not having any idea what to do, I put it on Facebook, sharing it with my friends and followers. I just needed to do with that experience what I usually do when I do standup \u2013 take ownership of it and express myself. It felt a bit better. I woke up the next day to see my post had been shared thousands of times. It was even in newspapers and on blogs. \u201cDanish Comedian Sofie Hagen Says: They Shouted Abuse At Me\u201d and \u201cMen Shout At Danish Comedian \u2013 What Happens Next Will Shock You\u201d and other such clickbaity headlines. People had posted such comments as, \u201cI am really sorry that happened to you,\u201d and \u201cThose guys were massive pricks.\u201d It stopped hurting. The hurt immediately disappeared. And all I was left with was anger. This is not a once-in-a-lifetime thing. This happens on a daily basis to hundreds of thousands of fat people everywhere. This is happening now, perhaps at this very moment, to a 14-year-old girl who has yet to realise that her body\u2019s worth is not dependent on what the media tells her it is. It is happening to children. It will happen again. Maybe tonight when I am walking home from a gig. This will happen online \u2013 some people will even be inclined to write it in response to this very article. People will tell me to stop promoting obesity and to just lose weight. People will tweet at me without having read the article and pretend that they are worried about my health. Some will even tell me I am making it up. Some fat people will say they have never experienced anything like that. This will happen on TV, in movies and on the radio. As I am writing this, my fat friend told me that last week she was hit on the head with a kebab \u2013 and yes, that is a really funny sentence \u2013 I am but human, and \u201ckebab\u201d is a funny word and that is a funny image. It is, however, unforgivable. It has always happened and it will continue to happen. But now it\u2019s different. I no longer feel good when people pity or comfort me afterwards. I do not need people\u2019s kind words. I need their fury. I need them to be angry with me. I need them to act. I need everyone to realise the repercussions of making \u201cfat\u201d mean lazy, stupid, unattractive and unhealthy. Fat is not necessarily unhealthy, and skinny is not necessarily healthy. I need people to stop saying \u201cYou are not fat, you are beautiful,\u201d as though they are mutually exclusive. I need people to feel angry \u2013 not at these four idiots at Kennington station \u2013 but at the society that created them. I need people to demand change. Tweet companies who use fatphobia to promote their products, email TV shows portraying fat women as sexless, evil or motherly and goofy. Call out your friends, family and teachers. If you won\u2019t then OK. But keep your pity to yourself. I am a healthy, beautiful, intelligent, active and creative fat woman. I\u2019m doing what I love for a living. I have friends and family who love me. I am good. I am no longer sad. I am just angry, and I wish you were too. \u2022 Sofie Hagen is on tour and will be performing Shimmer Shammer at the Soho Theatre in London, 5-17 December"
"11||Oil firms announce $1bn climate fund to clean up gasA $1bn fund for cutting the climate change impact of oil and gas has been announced by 10 of the world\u2019s biggest oil companies, aimed at keeping the firms in business and cutting the burning of coal. Global action to cut carbon emissions threaten the future of the oil industry and the fund was revealed on the day the global Paris climate change agreement came into force. But analysts called the sum a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d which showed the companies were not serious in tackling global warming. The new fund will focus on reducing leaks of natural gas \u2013 a powerful greenhouse agent \u2013 and technology to capture and store carbon emissions when gas is burned to produce electricity, as well as increasing the fuel efficiency of vehicles. But it will not support the renewable energy, smart grid and storage technologies which are revolutionising the electricity industry. Sustainable investment and climate change campaigners dismissed the initiative as \u2018greenwash\u2019, noting that, with the fund to be deployed over the next decade, the $100m annual investment represents just 0.1% of the companies\u2019 current level of yearly capital expenditure. Scientists have calculated that half of all known gas reserves and a third of oil reserves cannot be burned if the world is to meet the Paris limit of 2C of warming. This makes the oil companies\u2019 current business model of continuing exploration for new reserves nonsensical, say the campaigners. The 10 companies that comprise the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) produce 20% of the world\u2019s oil and gas. Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP and OGCI chairman, said: \u201cWe all absolutely realise the world will move to a low-carbon world. Don\u2019t worry, we got it. The technology to monitor and reduce fugitive methane [gas] emissions, that is an essential licence for us to advocate for natural gas.\u201d Dudley, whose own pay is higher than BP\u2019s contributions to the fund, said gas produced half the emissions of coal, the use of which is increasing in Asia. \u201cThe price of coal is low and people are choosing affordable energy not clean energy. It\u2019s going to make gas miss the opportunity.\u201d Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, CEO of Total, said the technologies the new fund would back were vital: \u201cIt is a matter for us of being able to maintain our business in the future.\u201d The OGCI see carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology as a way to prolong the continued use of fossil fuels. Scientists agree CCS is vital as without it the cost of tackling climate change will hugely increase, according to the the UN\u2019s climate science panel. But developing commercial scale CCS is likely to require many billions of dollars. Oil and gas contribute about 37% of global carbon emissions, with transport a major user of oil. The OGCI said it will work with auto manufacturers to develop more efficient vehicles but this will compete with the fast growth of electric cars. Defending the relatively small size of the fund, Josu Jon Imaz, CEO of Repsol, said: \u201cThe target of this fund is to be a seed, a catalyst.\u201d The new fund was not investing in renewable energy as it wanted to focus on where oil companies could have the most impact, he said. But Danni Paffard, at climate campaign group 350.org said: \u2018This announcement is outrageous filibustering from an industry with no future. Forget their smoke and mirrors offerings, the fossil fuel industry\u2019s basic business plan doesn\u2019t stack up with global climate goals. Real climate action means leaving oil, coal and gas reserves in the ground, and until they do that nobody will be falling for this cynical PR spin.\u201d Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank, said: \u201cInvesting $1bn over 10 years averages to just $10m per year per company involved. This figure is a drop in the ocean,\u201d he said. Bill Gates alone is contributing $1bn to the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, Marshall noted. \u201cThe business models of these companies are fundamentally incompatible with the Paris climate commitments,\u201d he said. \u201cThis announcement shows that oil and gas companies are contemplating no real deviation from their traditional business models.\u201d Juliet Philips, at sustainable investment NGO ShareAction, said: \u201cUntil initiatives like those announced by the OGCI are backed up by long-term corporate strategies that are consistent with achieving the Paris treaty, scepticism of their sincerity is inevitable.\u201d Managers of investments totalling more than $2.6tn have already committed to pulling out of fossil fuel companies. Shell CEO, Ben van Beurden, said: \u201cWe cannot burn all the hydrocarbons on the planet in an unmitigated way but there is also another truism that there is no alternative to using some hydrocarbons for a very long time to come.\u201d He said economics would determine which fossil fuels are left in the ground. Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, said: \u201cOil will continue to be part of the energy mix for decades to come.\u201d Oil companies are under increasing pressure from both climate change policy and the rise of renewable energy. In October, the International Energy Agency said the rollout of renewables was accelerating and predicted capacity from renewable sources will grow faster than oil, gas, coal or nuclear power in the next five years. On Wednesday, OGCI-member Shell, said oil demand could peak as soon as five years from now, a moment that would herald the end of oil production growth. The OGCI members are BP, CNPC, Eni, Pemex, Reliance Industries, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, Statoil and Total, but no US oil companies have joined."
"5||Purging of black Democrats from voter rolls raises election concerns\u2018The FBI is Trumpland\u2019 Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. Current and former FBI officials described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey\u2019s decision not to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s private email server. One currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is \u201cthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel\u201d.

Mass purging of black Democrats from voter rolls and African Americans\u2019 low early voting turnout is raising fresh concerns for Hillary Clinton. On a recent swing through North Carolina, Barack Obama drew attention to Grace Bell Hardison, a 100-year-old black woman whose voter registration was challenged in her home of Beaufort County in what officials called an effort to \u201cclear up\u201d the voting rolls. Of the list of 138 purged voters that included Hardison, 92 were black and registered Democrats. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen by accident,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere was a time when systematically denying black folks the right to vote was considered normal as well.\u201d In North Carolina and Florida, is the Trump voter suppression plan working?

It\u2019s not about rates rises \u2013 it\u2019s about cuts, warns Rogoff Markets nowadays are fixated on how high the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the next 12 months. This is dangerously shortsighted: the real concern ought to be how far it could cut rates in the next deep recession, writes Kenneth Rogoff professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University. Given that the Fed may struggle just to get its base interest rate up to 2% over the coming year, there will be very little room to cut if a recession hits. Fed will have little room to cut interest rates if recession hits The rise of the political meme These shareable, sometimes pithy and often puerile units of culture have emerged as the lingua franca of the 2016 election, and have given the American people an entirely new way of articulating their beliefs. Clinton\u2019s top tweet is a meme. Trump\u2019s taco bowl became one. Through memes, Ted Cruz was \u201cunmasked\u201d as the Zodiac killer. Jeb Bush\u2019s limp plea for applause got him Vined into oblivion. Bernie Sanders shared a moment with a bird. Memes can be fun, or they can be dumb. Meme warfare: how the power of mass replication has poisoned the US election How to foil facial recognition software \u2026 A team of researchers from Pittsburgh\u2019s Carnegie Mellon University have created sets of eyeglasses that can prevent wearers from being identified by facial recognition systems, or even fool the technology into identifying them as completely unrelated individuals. Researchers found by picking a pair of \u201cgeek\u201d frames, with relatively large rims and printing a pattern over those frames then had the effect of manipulating the image and making the wearers face unreadable.

In 2016 that allegiance feels as flimsy as ever, but a wide range of factors have made the 2016 election a taboo topic of conversation in Nashville\u2019s country music industry. \u201cEverybody seems to be wanting to talk about it, but there\u2019s no public discourse,\u201d says songwriter Bobby Braddock. Country music has become apolitical\u2019: why have acts kept quiet on the election?"
"23||The best recent crime novels \u2013 review roundupDarktown, by Thomas Mullen (Little, Brown, \u00a316.99) is set in Atlanta, Georgia, which, in 1948, is a place where black lives don\u2019t matter \u2013 at least, not to the white authorities. The police force has, however, just hired its first black officers. Tasked with policing the \u201ccoloured\u201d neighbourhoods, the eight men find themselves in the impossible position of upholding the law while still being, in the segregated \u201cJim Crow\u201d south of the US, second-class citizens. Issued with guns and badges, they have no squad car and are forbidden to arrest white suspects. They face constant taunts and racial abuse as well as suspicion from their own community and, denied access to the police stations, the men are forced to operate out of a dingy basement. When a black woman, last seen in a car with a drunken white man, is murdered, the powers that be are indifferent, and it is left to officers Boggs and Smith, with help from sympathetic white cop Rakestraw, to try and find the culprit. Fascinating, grim and unsettling, this is a story of violent and ingrained racism, political corruption, conspiracy and almost unbearable psychological pressure. Tall Oaks (twenty7, \u00a37.99), the first novel from Chris Whitaker, set in a fictitious American small town in California, is a pleasingly unusual mixture of psychological thriller and screwball comedy from a young writer who is clearly not afraid to take risks. When three-year-old Harry goes missing, everyone wants to help, but when he doesn\u2019t turn up, mother Jess finds herself in a destructive spiral of booze and promiscuity, despite support from the local chief of police and the community. The supporting cast includes Manny, a podgy, potty-mouthed teenager who wants to be a gangster and who swelters in his woollen three-piece suit and too-tight fedora as he tries to extort money from local shopkeepers, and Jerry, the mountainous, slow-witted manager of a local photo store. They are an absolute delight. That this highly original mashup doesn\u2019t entirely come off is, I think, mainly due to Whitaker\u2019s lack of writing experience \u2013 subtler characterisation is required for the denouement to be entirely convincing \u2013 but the combination of verve, humour and pathos make it well worth a read. The Child Garden (Constable, \u00a37.99) is a contemporary standalone novel from Catriona McPherson, author of the Dandy Gilver series. The life of bookish council registrar Gloria Harkness revolves around work and visiting a care home to read to her comatose 15-year-old son, who suffers from a neurodegenerative condition, and to chat to her elderly landlady. Thirty years earlier, the building housed a school of the progressive, hippy-dippy variety called Eden, which was closed after one of its pupils drowned in mysterious circumstances. The re\u2011appearance of a former Eden pupil, Gloria\u2019s old friend Stephen, and the discovery of the corpse of another ex-student in the now-overgrown grounds lead to a police investigation in which Stephen becomes the primary suspect. Gloria, making her own inquiries, finds that a number of those present on the night of the original tragedy have either killed themselves or had remarkably bad luck in life ... Set in rural Scotland, The Child Garden is both utterly intriguing and disturbingly eerie. Told from multiple points of view, The Silence Between Breaths by Cath Staincliffe (Constable, \u00a319.99) is a tale of strangers on a train \u2013 in this case, the 10.35am from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston. The hopes, fears and concerns of the passengers are various: a job interview, a holiday, difficulties at work, stroppy children, a parent with dementia \u2026 And in the middle of the travellers sits Saheel, a man on a mission, armed with a lethal rucksack. The story begins with the mundane and ends with the horrific. It\u2019s fairly clear what\u2019s going to happen from the off, but Staincliffe is a sensitive and humane writer whose talent for characterisation is such that our investment in Naz, Holly, Jeff and the rest of the potentially doomed passengers is the fuel for real suspense. Undertow, a psychological thriller with a nod to Daphne du Maurier\u2019s Rebecca, is the debut novel from Elizabeth Heathcote (Quercus, \u00a312.99). Journalist Carmen, second wife to lawyer Tom and stepmother to his three children, feels uncomfortable around first wife Laura, even though she was not the cause of the break-up and Laura is unfailingly polite. However, this is as nothing compared to Carmen\u2019s discomfiture over Zena, the glamorous woman for whom Tom left Laura, and who subsequently drowned off the Norfolk coast. When chance remarks lead Carmen to suspect that Zena\u2019s death was not, after all, an accident, she starts to investigate, and begins to worry that Tom might have been responsible. A strong sense of place, deft plotting and moments of genuine surprise make up for a lack of emotional depth and some unconvincingly summarised scenes."
"21||My husband\u2019s ex-wife is still treated as part of the family while I feel excludedMy husband divorced his first wife 20 years ago. They have one child, with whom he has a difficult relationship. I am a relatively recent addition to the family and was not entangled in his messy breakup. His ex-wife is best friends with some family members, who, out of loyalty, cannot fully embrace me. She is still included in family emails, her birthday is acknowledged, gifts are exchanged, she stays in the family home when she visits (sometimes for several weeks) and joins the family for Christmas. They sometimes mix us up and call me by her name. The first wife has spoken ill of me and my husband. Even though I am financially independent with my own assets, and we have a pre-nup, the ex and child fear my grabbing his inheritance. He thinks it normal for families to include ex-partners to this extent and feels I ought to accept it. This is my second marriage too, and while I keep in touch with my ex-husband\u2019s family, I restrict contact to sending good wishes at Christmas and on special birthdays. I accept that I am not part of that family any more, even though my own child is. I have never discussed matters of inheritance with my ex or tried to influence his will for my child. I cannot accept what seems like an unusual status quo in my husband\u2019s family. I feel excluded and disrespected.

"5||'Anti-white' graffiti in gentrifying LA  neighborhood sparks hate crime debatePolice in Los Angeles are investigating the vandalism of art galleries in a Latino neighbourhood, including the spray-painted message \u201cfuck white art\u201d, as possible hate crimes. Three galleries were targeted last month amid rising concern in Boyle Heights that an influx of galleries heralds gentrification. A coalition of community leaders and leftwing militants has mobilised over the past year to protest, confront and in some cases intimidate galleries whom they fear will pave the way for development that will push out residents and erase a cradle of Chicano identity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who actually did [the vandalism], but because it actually made a reference to anti-white art or anti-white, it\u2019s basically saying that it\u2019s a hate crime based on that,\u201d detective John Parra of the LAPD\u2019s Hollenbeck station told the Los Angeles Times on Thursday. Police recently met gallery owners and requested advance notice of future exhibitions so that police could consider additional patrols, he said. The vandalism incidents remain under investigation. Boyle Heights is a largely low-income neighbourhood which sits across the LA river from downtown, a formerly depressed zone which is being transformed by new museums, galleries, loft apartments and skyscrapers. Over the past year activists, some with masks, others with megaphones, have confronted realtors and tour groups, picketed galleries and used a brass band blowing with all its might to sabotage an open air-opera. Activists scorned the notion that tagging galleries represented a hate crime. \u201cThe walls in my neigbourhood are the people\u2019s newspaper. That\u2019s people expressing themselves,\u201d says Xochitl Palomera of the advocacy group Coraz\u00f3n Del Pueblo. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about someone spray-painting a wall with truth. Whoever wrote that is hurting and is angry.\u201d The dozen or so galleries that have crossed the river were almost all white-owned and were opening the floodgates to economic forces which could drown the culture of Boyle Heights, said Palomera. \u201cWe want these galleries out. They are going to be destructive to the things that we have been creating.\u201d She said there was no such thing as reverse racism. \u201cBecause you know what, we\u2019ve been experiencing oppression for hundreds of years. We\u2019re not going to take this sitting down.\u201d She said the true hate crime was the LAPD\u2019s killing of Jesse Romero, a 14-year-old boy, in August. Police said he was tagging gang-type graffiti and may have fired a gun when confronted by officers. Romero\u2019s family disputes that and called the killing excessive force. Ruben, an activist with Serve the People LA (STPLA), a Maoist offshoot, said \u201crighteous anger\u201d over the risk of displacement fueled the graffiti. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it and don\u2019t know who did it, but we celebrate it.\u201d Race was irrelevant, said Ruben, who declined to give a last name. \u201cWe\u2019re not hating on white people. We don\u2019t have an anti-white philosophy. We\u2019re the colonised resisting colonisation. We love our community and are going to defend it no matter what. For LAPD to say this is a potential hate crime when they kill young brown people is ludicrous and disgustingly ironic.\u201d Mynor Godoy, president of the Boyle Heights neighbourhood council, but speaking in a personal capacity, said graffiti was common in Boyle Heights and that galleries reflected a \u201ccertain level of privilege\u201d by calling the police. Rising rents and evictions were already forcing out long term residents, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth trying to provide more context about why this may be happening.\u201d The Guardian found one dissenting voice: Steven Almazan, a former neighborhood council member currently pursuing a Master\u2019s in public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, said the anti-gentrification resistance jarred with the area\u2019s melting pot history: Japanese and European Jews settled here before Mexicans. \u201cThe fact they\u2019re using racially-based tactics is a bit demoralising. Boyle Heights once was seen as the Ellis Island of the west coast. It shouldn\u2019t be a place of contention. Art galleries do not cause gentrification. They\u2019re a byproduct of systemic issues. There has to be a more productive way for the city, developers and the folks of Boyle Heights to [advance] the discussion.\u201d Jonathan Jones, the Guardian\u2019s art critic, has criticised the Boyle Heights \u201cartwashing\u201d as daft and possessing a destructive logic. One of the twists to the conflict in Boyle Heights is that some of the artists who are driving LA\u2019s cultural boom were themselves displaced by tech-driven gentrification in San Francisco."
"20||What I wore this week: this season\u2019s minimalismMinimalism. Sounds so simple, doesn\u2019t it? In theory, you should able to whack on a white shirt and black trousers, and sit back secure in the knowledge you were the epitome of minimal chic. But that\u2019s not quite how it works. Some seasons a white shirt and black trousers is unbeatable. Others, it\u2019s fine, but nothing more. And this autumn is one of the latter. The waters are muddied here by the fact that some women can slay any room, anywhere, anytime, in a white shirt and black trousers. I know this for a fact because they are a hazard of the job, working in fashion. There I\u2019ll be, slightly effortfully glammed up, and she\u2019ll slink out of some atelier, emanating self-possession and making the rest of us feel like Cinderella\u2019s stepsisters, wearing too much perfume and trying to jam our feet into uncomfortable shoes. It is unbelievably annoying, and also misleading, because this type of woman makes it look as if a white shirt and black trousers is always the answer. And it\u2019s not. Right now, the highest form of minimalism features no black and no white. It calls for no contrast at all. Instead, pick a neutral \u2013 I am modelling grey, this being the wall-colour-of-my-generation, but navy is good, brown is coming on strong and pale pink sort of works too, these days. And you wear the same neutral, tone-on-tone, head to toe. While it lacks the early morning no-brainer appeal of black and white, on the upside there is something quite comforting about this look; cosy and modern, which is a good combination. You want it understated and serene, so matt fabrics only; if you must wear tights, make sure they are not satin or velvet effect and white trainers or brogues are better than dark boots, oddly. Most importantly, factor in enough layers: there\u2019s no point putting this look together if you\u2019re going to ruin it by getting chilly and absentmindedly putting a black jumper on top. Minimalism calls for more effort than you\u2019d think. This is not a black and white issue. \u2022 Jess wears jumper, \u00a369, polo neck, \u00a345, and trousers, \u00a369, all cosstores.com.

"21||Delia\u2019s Christmas cake recipe takes a little bit of practiceNow that Halloween is cold in its grave, it\u2019s that time of year again. You know: spending the next month tutting whenever you hear Christmas music while becoming increasingly excited that Christmas is coming. This year is particularly exciting as, for the first time, my partner and I are not spending it with either of our families but are instead staying at home. I haven\u2019t quite decided what to make for pudding yet, but I decided to get in the spirit by having a first attempt at Delia\u2019s Irish whiskey Christmas cakes. This is a recipe that requires something of a run-up. In order to get the flavours right, it must be stored in the fridge for seven days, where the mixture of whiskey, Angostura bitters, raisins, currants and almonds has to be given time to mature along with your growing irritation at the large box now taking up space in your fridge to house this delicious cake. At least, that\u2019s the theory. I ran into a few problems with this recipe \u2013 not least that the first time around the lag between making a hash of the recipe, and then discovering this, made it difficult to remember what, exactly, I had done wrong. I advise taking notes on the first couple of run-throughs. Delia\u2019s recipe uses nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. My advice is to buy the right amounts fresh to make this cake, unless you prefer the prospect of Stephen\u2019s Overwhelming Clove and Whiskey cake to Delia\u2019s mellower, authentic version. My second difficulty came with the whiskey itself. I\u2019ve always wanted to persuade myself to like whiskey, as it always looks terribly sophisticated in movies, but I have yet to succeed \u2013 other than in cakes, where I like it a great deal. As I didn\u2019t much fancy shelling out for a particularly high-quality bottle of the stuff, I went low-budget. (I\u2019m ashamed to admit that my preparation for this recipe consisted of googling \u201ccheap Irish whiskey\u201d and buying a bottle for a tenner.) I found that the resulting cake still tasted a little too strongly of whiskey \u2013 and cloves of course. It tasted like someone\u2019s mouth after an evening of cheap booze and mince pies \u2013 so if you\u2019ve ever had an ill-advised hookup at a Christmas party, and wanted to recreate the experience in cake form, I have an excellent recipe for you. My advice is to slightly under-dose on the whiskey in Delia\u2019s recipe, who I imagine went for a rather better bottle than I did. That, or buy better whiskey. The finished product is meant to look like an elegantly wrapped parcel, which \u2013 if you remove the word \u201celegantly\u201d \u2013 mine does. The finished product a la Delia looks like the presents you buy that are gift-wrapped in-store. My finished product looks like a present wrapped by an enthusiastic child \u2013 very possibly a child who has been helping themselves to the whiskey. To hold it all together, Delia uses marzipan as a joining agent. I am aware that marzipan is a divisive foodstuff \u2013 some people think it\u2019s disgusting \u2013 and I am happy to report that there are three ways around this. The first is to make more of the apricot jam and whiskey mixture and use that to hold it together. The second is to use regular icing. The third \u2013 and my preferred option \u2013 is to turn the page to Delia\u2019s recipe for Irish tea bread, which I made out of curiosity while waiting for the cake mixture to mature. It\u2019s simple, delicious \u2013 and to me, really tastes like Christmas. Stephen Bush\u2019s task is to cook his way through Delia\u2019s Complete How To Cook (BBC Books, \u00a340) in a year.
