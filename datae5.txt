"0||Matthew Leveson inquest: NSW coroner delivers open finding on deathThe New South Wales coroner has delivered an open finding into the death of Matthew Leveson. Leveson was 20 when he went missing in 2007. He was last seen in the early hours of 23 September leaving a Sydney nightclub with his boyfriend Michael Atkins. His body was found in May this year, after Atkins led police to a spot in a national park south of Sydney. A jury found Atkins not guilty of murder or manslaughter in a 2009 trial, and he was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for leading police to Leveson\u2019s body during the inquest. Atkins told police he did not kill Leveson, that his boyfriend had died of a drug overdose. He told police that he had disguised the death because he was \u201cconcerned that people would think badly of him for not looking after Matt\u201d. The deputy state coroner Elaine Truscott found that Atkins told a \u201cplethora of lies\u201d during interviews with the police and throughout his sworn evidence before the inquest which \u201cgive rise to a considerable degree of suspicion that Mr Atkins had some connection with Matt\u2019s death apart from the fact that he buried Matt\u2019s body\u201d. \u201cHowever, it does not follow from that degree of suspicion that I can find that Mr Atkins was involved in any acts which were causative of Matt\u2019s death,\u201d she found. Truscott pointed out numerous inconsistencies and outright lies in Atkins interviews with police and in his testimony to the inquiry, including his assertion that he had forced Leveson to leave the Sydney nightclub because he was concerned about his welfare. She also recommended Leveson\u2019s mother and father be given an official police commendation after Mark Leveson wore a wire in 2008 to speak to Atkins at his Cronulla apartment. During the conversation Atkins admitted that he had lied to police about purchasing a mattock from a Bunnings hardware store. He also denied that Leveson could have died from a drug overdose because he was \u201ccareful\u201d with dosages. She said Atkins\u2019 testimony at the inquest that he\u2019d purchased the mattock to build a vegetable garden for Leveson was \u201cnonsense\u201d. Truscott was also sceptical about Atkins\u2019 claim that he and Leveson had a \u201cloving, close\u201d relationship. She pointed out that he\u2019d had text exchanges with at least two young men on the afternoon of 23 September \u201capparently looking for a date\u201d. She also cited testimony that their relationship had seemed \u201cstrained\u201d, that Leveson felt \u201csmothered\u201d, and that Atkins was \u201cpossessive\u201d and \u201ccontrolling\u201d, and that he\u2019d been \u201cphysically aggressive\u201d toward Leveson on at least two occasions. Mark and Faye Leveson had mixed feelings about the findings, saying they did not believe Atkins\u2019 latest version of events. They still allege he\u2019s responsible for their son\u2019s death. \u201cThere\u2019s some relief, there\u2019s some frustration, there\u2019s some anger, so there\u2019s lots of emotions going through us but relief\u2019s one of the ones right now,\u201d Leveson told reporters outside Glebe coroner\u2019s court. But they say they achieved their main goal from the inquest \u2013 to find Matthew and bring him home. \u201cOur son was the most precious thing to us and to his brothers, why would we worry about Atkins,\u201d Faye Leveson said on Tuesday. \u201cWe would have loved both but we were forced in this corner, and Matty comes first every time.\u201d Truscott was also critical of some of the police investigation, including a search of Atkins\u2019 garage during which he lied about whether any of Leveson\u2019s belongings were inside. Truscott said video of the search showed Atkins \u201cbend over and look, in my view, consistent with an intention to check that whatever was there was well hidden\u201d. \u201cThis can be seen on video, however none of the police officers executing the warrant, including the video operator, picked this up,\u201d she said. \u201cGiven the police knowledge that Mr Atkins had told lies, his every move should have been closely scrutinised and that very moment \u2013 whilst fleeting \u2013 was a lost opportunity.\u201d"

"0||Australian education poll: 60% say funding cuts limit university accessSix out of 10 Australians think cuts to university funding would limit access to tertiary education and the same proportion would oppose attempts to reduce the education budget by circumventing the parliament, polling conducted for the university\u2019s lobbying arm has found. On Monday it was reported the education minister, Simon Birmingham, was considering non-legislative changes to funding, including axing the higher education participation and partnerships program (Heppp), which helps students from low-income families access university. Universities Australia responded on Tuesday by releasing polling conducted on its behalf which found 60% of respondents opposed cutting equity programs that support poorer students to go to university, without approval from parliament. Almost as many (59%) opposed cutting research funding for universities without approval from parliament, another measure reportedly being considered by the government, and 63% agreed cuts to funding would limit access. The numbers were higher among people from regional areas and over 55s, with 69% of those demographics saying they opposed cuts to funding that were not put through parliament. The poll of 1,575 people was conducted by JWS Research between 24 and 28 November. The chief executive of Universities Australia, Belinda Robinson, said the results showed the government would be making the wrong decision if it pursued non-legislative cuts. \u201cThe government keeps coming up with creative new ways to cut funding to public universities, but the message from voters remains the same: it\u2019s the wrong decision for Australia\u2019s future,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Senate has been crystal clear on this too, and would quite rightly take a dim view of any bid to go around the legislative protections for higher education funding. \u201cThey can see what the government seems unable to: cuts to universities are not what this country needs as we head into an era of stronger global competition and a greater need for higher skills.\u201d The government has sought to put pressure on opponents of the government\u2019s higher education bill by hinting it would find another way to reduce education spending if necessary. On Monday Birmingham said the government was \u201cconsidering all options\u201d to trim spending. The bill, which is opposed by Labor, the Greens and the Nick Xenophon team, would impose a two-year 2.5% efficiency dividend on universities, lower the Help debt repayment threshold to $42,000 and increase fees by a cumulative total of 7.5% by 2021, and would introduce performance contingent funding aimed at increasing graduate outcomes."
"1||Kevin De Bruyne disappointed Paul Pogba will miss Manchester derbyKevin De Bruyne has said he wishes Paul Pogba were available for Sunday\u2019s Manchester derby because he relishes coming up against the best players. Pogba will be starting a three-match ban after his red card in Manchester United\u2019s 3-1 win at Arsenal for a challenge on H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn. Pogba said last week that he hoped Manchester City players would suffer injuries to help United\u2019s title push but De Bruyne rejected the idea that karma was at work. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that,\u201d the City player said. \u201cI\u2019m a very straightforward guy. If someone believes it is karma then OK. Everyone has their right to their opinion. I don\u2019t want anyone to get injured. It\u2019s a competition, you want to play against the best teams and the best players. \u201cI don\u2019t care [what he says]. He can say whatever he wants. We just have to be focused on whatever we\u2019re doing. He\u2019s a massive player. I know him a little bit. He\u2019s unbelievable. He took a red card and that\u2019s the way it goes \u2013 you have injuries and suspensions.\u201d If City win at Old Trafford they will move 11 points clear at the top. De Bruyne said: \u201cIt means we [would] almost have a four-game advantage. It\u2019s a good gap but doesn\u2019t mean anything. Football goes very quick. It\u2019s a busy two months when things can change but the way we\u2019re going is good and we need to continue that. \u201cUnited are one of the biggest clubs in the country. They\u2019re a massive team, they want to win the title. They spent a lot of money, like a lot of the big teams. They will be up for it and we will be up for it. Hopefully it\u2019ll be a good game. We\u2019ll play the same there. We never change. We try to do the things that we are good at. That gives us the best chance to win.\u201d De Bruyne is not travelling to Kharkiv for Wednesday night\u2019s final Champions League group game against Shakhtar Donestk because he is suspended. There is nothing riding on the game for City, who are through as group winners. \u201cMaybe [it is] good for me to get a little bit of rest and prepare myself for Sunday,\u201d De Bruyne said. Pep Guardiola has been reminded of his responsibilities by the Football Association but will face no action for his animated exchange with Nathan Redmond at the end of Manchester City\u2019s 2-1 victory over Southampton on Wednesday. The FA asked the City manager for his observations regarding the incident which occurred after the final whistle at the Etihad Stadium. Guardiola, who had just seen Raheem Sterling score a 96th-minute winner, approached Redmond to remonstrate with him in what appeared a vehement manner. Although Redmond issued a statement to make it clear he had no issue with Guardiola, the FA wrote to Guardiola to request clarification. On Friday Guardiola admitted: \u201cI can\u2019t control myself\u201d but said he hoped to improve, and the FA has accepted his explanation while making him aware as to his future conduct."
"2||Rejuvenated James DeGale eyes path to another shot at George GrovesSeven weeks ago James DeGale finally got the all-clear to do what he does best: curl his right hand into a fist and, for the first time since January, unleash it in anger. But watching the IBF world super-middleweight champion swarm round his trainer Jim McDonnell, snapping tigerishly at his pads, you would never know anything was awry. His jab is sharp and peppery. Combinations flow with a pleasant viciousness. And the only sign of career-saving surgery is a thick scar along his right shoulder. DeGale knew something drastic needed to be done after being forced to fight one-handed in a brutal draw against the American Badou Jack at the start of the year, during which a bridge on his upper teeth was smashed and he was put down in the 12th round. The road back has been tinged with too much pain and boredom but, as he prepares to face the unheralded Caleb Truax on Saturday, he insists he is a new man. \u201cAgainst Jack my shoulder was totally gone,\u201d says DeGale. \u201cWhen I went to see the surgeon afterwards I had a 180 degree tear around the shoulder, my AC joint needed stabilising and my rotator cuff was torn. They went in keyhole, slit me open and found my shoulder was mashed.\u201d After surgery there was months of rehabilitation, during which time DeGale feared that he would never box again. \u201cYeah, I was doubting myself,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly after about three months did it start getting better. I couldn\u2019t lift my arm at first, or button a shirt up. \u201cI have actually only been punching for the past seven weeks, which is crazy. But now you will see what I can do, I promise. I\u2019ll be jabbing, double jabbing and hooking off the jab.\u201d However, the injury did have its compensations. \u201cActually, the girl I was seeing was washing me, it was brilliant,\u201d he says, beaming broadly. \u201cI\u2019ve got a stand-up shower and she\u2019d get in and wash me. I think I milked it for a little bit.\u201d Even if there is some rust in the shoulder DeGale should have few problems beating Truax, who has a superficially impressive 30-3 record but has lost on every venture into world level. DeGale then intends to unify the belts by beating the WBA champion David Benavidez in March or April before targeting a rematch with his bitter rival George Groves, who remains the only man to defeat him as a professional in a controversial points decision in 2011. \u201cI heard an interview with him the other day and he said he\u2019s the No1 in the world,\u201d says DeGale, sounding flabbergasted. \u201cHow does he justify that? Who has he boxed? I beat Andre Dirrell for my world title, he was 24-1 with his only loss against Carl Froch. Then I went to Canada and beat Lucian Bute who was a five-year world champion, then I mash up Rogelio Medina who was my mandatory, then I unified with Jack.\u201d Any meeting will first need Groves, the WBC champion, to beat Chris Eubank Jr when the pair meet in their Super Series semi-final fight in February and probably Callum Smith in the final. But DeGale thinks it is possible. \u201cI\u2019d like Groves to come through it because I want to fight him again and we could do it with our belts on the line,\u201d he says. \u201cOur history goes back a long way and it would be a fantastic fight.\u201d Yet DeGale admits that he does not like the fame that comes with success. \u201cBelieve it or not, I don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI like nice things, I love money really, don\u2019t I? But I don\u2019t love the fame side. All I care about is my world title, being in big fights and being known for that.\u201d \u201cI get asked to go on all sorts of TV shows and I have turned down so much shit. There were talks about going into the jungle, Strictly and Big Brother \u2013 and I\u2019m a good dancer so I\u2019d smash Strictly.\u201d For now, at least, smashing opponents remains his first priority. A point he intends to emphasise on Saturday night."
"1||Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Conte warns Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to prepare for Europa LeagueAntonio Conte was in bullish mood before Chelsea\u2019s final Champions League group fixture, telling opponents Atl\u00e9tico Madrid: \u201cYou may be in good form, but so are we.\u201d Atl\u00e9tico have reached the Champions League final twice in the past three seasons and are unbeaten domestically, but even victory might not be enough to see them qualify for this year\u2019s knockout stages. Chelsea beat Atl\u00e9tico 2-1 at the Wanda Metropolitano in September and Conte warned his rival that \u201cplaying the Europa League can happen\u201d. \u201cI think Madrid is always a strong team and now I think they are in a good moment of form but is the same for us for sure,\u201d Conte said. \u201cThe game will be open because Atl\u00e9tico Madrid will try to win, but it will be the same for us. The only difference is that the final result for them is too important. We are already qualified.\u201d Antoine Griezmann has returned to form, scoring four goals in the past three matches. Next month he will be joined in attack by Diego Costa, who left Chelsea in acrimonious circumstances last summer and did not travel with the Atl\u00e9tico squad for this match. But Conte rejected the suggestion any player was more important than another. \u201cI think we must have great respect for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, the whole team, they are one of the best teams in Spain\u201d, he said. \u201cThree games ago there was a problem with Griezmann, because he didn\u2019t score. Now he is scoring but Griezmann is a top player. He plays in a great team. If, after tomorrow\u2019s game, they have to play in the Europa League, it can happen. But we must have great respect for the whole team, first of all for his coach.\u201d Another player who has felt the wrath of Conte was David Luiz and he will not feature in the match after sitting out training. Conte insisted this was down solely to a knee injury suffered by the Brazilian. When asked if there was any enduring problem between the pair, Conte was brusque. \u201cThat was two weeks ago, that was the past.\u201d There may soon be a resolution to one off-the-pitch issue for Chelsea, the identity of the club\u2019s next technical director. Michael Emenalo, who had occupied the position for a decade, left Stamford Bridge last month and reports suggest the role may now be offered to Leonid Slutsky, who was relieved of his duties as Hull City manager on Sunday. Slutsky has a long-standing relationship with his fellow Russian Roman Abramovich and the pair are expected to meet this week to discuss opportunities, though the 46-year-old replacing Emenalo is not guaranteed. Slutsky himself is believed to be considering taking a break from football, while Chelsea may yet split the role between more than one candidate. Emenalo, meanwhile, has spoken about his time at Chelsea and asserted his admiration for Conte. A dispute between the pair over last summer\u2019s transfer activity was believed to have contributed to the 52-year-old\u2019s departure in November but both men have spoken warmly of each other since. Claiming Conte was one of \u201cthe best three coaches in the world\u201d, Emenalo, who is now technical director of Monaco, insisted Conte enjoyed the full support of Abramovich. \u201cHe enjoys a lot of respect at the senior level, the board level and the ownership level of the club,\u201d he told TalkSport, \u201cso there should be no worries at all.\u201d"
"3||The Hague says claims of war crimes by UK troops have 'reasonable basis'The chief prosecutor at the international criminal court in The Hague, Fatou Bensouda, has declared there is a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to believe that UK soldiers committed war crimes against detainees during the Iraq conflict. The announcement on Monday means the ICC will press ahead with its investigation into claims that British troops abused and unlawfully killed prisoners after the US-led invasion. It came in a 74-page report delivered in New York to the annual assembly of states parties that participate in the jurisdiction of the court. In her conclusion on the long-running inquiry into the role of British troops in Iraq between 2003 and 2008, Bensouda said: \u201cThe [prosecutor\u2019s] office has reached the conclusion that there is a reasonable basis to believe that members of the UK armed forces committed war crimes within the jurisdiction of the court against persons in their custody.\u201d Bensouda does, however, dismiss allegations that British troops committed any war crimes on the battlefield. The report says: \u201cIn the absence of information indicating intent to kill or target civilians or civilian objects, or cause clearly excessive civilian injuries, there is no reasonable basis to believe that war crimes within the jurisdiction of the court were committed by British armed forces in the course of their military operations not related to the context of arrests and detentions.\u201d Both conclusions reaffirm interim conclusions made by the court when it ended a previous, preliminary investigation into similar allegations in 2006. At that point, the ICC said it had seen evidence suggesting British troops did commit war crimes in Iraq, \u201cnamely wilful killing and inhuman treatment\u201d. However, the court concluded that it should take no action at that stage since there were fewer than 20 allegations. The ICC\u2019s investigation was subsequently reopened by Bensouda in 2014 after receiving fresh information from, among others, the Birmingham law firm, Public Interest Lawyers (PIL). PIL, which has since closed down, represented the family of Baha Mousa, the Iraqi hotel receptionist tortured to death by British troops in 2003. The firm\u2019s Phil Shiner was subsequently prosecuted by the Solicitors Regulation Authority and disbarred from being a solicitor over allegations linked to other claims he pursued in relation to Iraqi claimants. Bensouda\u2019s report examines the controversy over the claims and refers to the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT). It says that \u201camid concerns of political interference, the defence secretary [Michael Fallon] announced the closing of IHAT ahead of the originally scheduled time frame by 30 June 2017, citing IHAT\u2019s own forecasts that the unit\u2019s caseload was expected to reduce to around 20 investigations by the summer 2017.\u201d Bensouda said her office had \u201cexercised an abundance of care\u201d because the more recent allegations against UK forces in Iraq were mostly brought to the office\u2019s attention by only one source. British defence officials have previously said they were confident that the ICC would not move to the next stage and announce a formal investigation, largely because the UK has the capacity to investigate the allegations itself. A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a legal responsibility to investigate credible allegations of wrongdoing by UK forces, and that is what we are already doing as part of service police legacy investigations, which is reviewing the relatively small number of remaining cases after the closure of IHAT, and through Operation Northmoor. \u201cWe are confident that our existing efforts to investigate allegations preclude the need for any investigation by the ICC.\u201d"
"4||Fury as Mexico presidential candidate pitches amnesty for drug cartel kingpinsA leading Mexican presidential candidate has been accused of wanting to explore a deal with the devil in an attempt to bring peace to the country. Speaking in the violence-wracked southern state of Guerrero this weekend, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador floated the idea of an amnesty for drug cartel kingpins, saying he wanted a dialogue on the drug war that has cost the country an estimated 200,000 lives over the last decade. \u201cIf it is necessary \u2026 we will talk about granting amnesty so long as the victims and their families are willing,\u201d he said. He later told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019ll propose it. I\u2019m analyzing it. What I can say is that we will leave no issue without discussion if it has to do with peace and tranquility.\u201d The comments caused condemnation from L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s opponents in the political and business classes \u2013 many of whom are unnerved by a surge in support for the populist leftwinger. But his comments also brought accusations of extreme insensitivity, as drug cartels have been responsible for horrific crimes against rivals and innocent bystanders. Guerrero itself has been badly hit by a war for control of the opium poppy and heroin industries, and L\u00f3pez Obrador made the remarks in a town where violence is so severe that his own political party, Morena, has still not been able to find a candidate. \u201cI would hope they never kidnap, torture, kill, disappear and burn [his] loved ones,\u201d Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz Navarro, whose brother was kidnapped and killed in the area, told El Universal. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if after this he would come to Guerrero to ask them for forgiveness.\u201d The proposal came as violence unleashed by a decade-long drug cartel crackdown shows few signs of slowing: Mexico recently registered its most murderous month in memory, with 2,371 homicides recorded in October. And supporters of AMLO (as L\u00f3pez Obrador is known) wondered aloud why the comments stirred such outrage in a country where politicians are widely seen as working hand-in-glove with the narcos. Others argued that the proposal at least offered an alternative to the current government strategy, which has depended heavily on deploying soldiers who have themselves been accused of grave human rights violations. \u201cFor 12 years our country has undergone thousands of cycles of vengeance. It\u2019s not a bad thing to sit back and think about how more soldiers and more war will only perpetuate this,\u201d tweeted Andr\u00e9s Lajous, an academic. Political maneuvering has already begun for the 1 July 2018 presidential election, but none of the parties or potential candidates have made curbing the violence a central plank of their platform. . Analysts say politicians see little profit in focusing on an issue with no easy solutions. But AMLO\u2019s comments also prompted uneasy comparisons with the so-called pax mafiosa under which the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) allegedly formed pacts with cartel bosses curtail violence. Such a deal would prove impossible, however, as the country\u2019s drug cartels have splintered, leaving few big bosses left to negotiate with. \u201cIt would not do much to stop the ongoing violence,\u201d said Tom Long, international relations professor at the University of Warwick. \u201cThe market and the rewards would continue to exist, and different groups would continue to compete \u2013 often violently \u2013 over that market.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador leads early polls, with a recent survey in the newspaper Reforma putting him 14 points ahead of the likely PRI candidate, the former finance minister Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade. When he took office five years ago, the PRI president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto promised to calm the country and combat the crimes affecting ordinary people. He mostly avoided talking about cartel killings and violence and instead preferred to talk up an agenda of economic reforms. Some said the outrage at AMLO pointed in the wrong direction. \u201cI think it\u2019s very revealing of the media bias that they\u2019re dedicating such time to this,\u201d said Viridiana R\u00edos, scholar at the Wilson Centre, a Washington thinktank. \u201cThe true story isn\u2019t what AMLO wants to do, rather what Pe\u00f1a Nieto has done so that we\u2019ve arrived in this situation.\u201d"
"0||Marriage equality survey marred by doubling in reported assaultsLGBTIQ Australians reported that they experienced more than double the number of verbal and physical assaults during the three-month marriage law postal survey, according to research released on Tuesday. The survey of 9,500 LGBTIQ Australians, their friends and families, conducted by the Australia Institute and the National LGBTI Health Alliance, found that more than 90% reported the postal vote had a negative impact on them \u201cto some degree\u201d. Despite the 61.6% vote in favour of same-sex marriage in the postal vote, the preliminary results of the self-selecting survey painted a bleak picture of LGBTIQ Australians\u2019 experience during the debate, as the House of Representatives continues to consider the cross-party marriage bill on Tuesday. In debate on Monday evening, the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, called for greater protections for religious freedom but conceded that conservative amendments to the marriage bill were unlikely to succeed. The most shocking finding of the study was that LGBTIQ respondents said that experiences of verbal and physical assaults more than doubled in the three months following the announcement of the postal survey compared with the prior six months. They reported an increase of more than a third in depression, anxiety and stress during the same period. Almost 80% of LGBTIQ people and almost 60% of allies said they found the marriage equality debate considerably or extremely stressful. The findings echoed research conducted after the Irish same-sex marriage referendum which found most LGBTIQ people felt angry and distressed in response to negative campaigning. Lead researcher Saan Ecker said the initial results showed \u201cthe debate was a highly stressful event for many LGBTIQ people and their allies\u201d, describing the reports of assault in particular as \u201cdisturbing\u201d. The executive director of the National LGBTI Health Alliance, Rebecca Reynolds, said the debate about \u201cthe equality of our bodies, relationships and feelings has been exhausting and frequently painful ... These aspects of who we are should never have been the subject of public discussion, rather they should be celebrated in everyday life,\u201d she said. The Australia Institute\u2019s deputy director, Ebony Bennett, said the survey showed \u201cthe real human impact of the marriage equality debate as well as the resilience of a community that has faced discrimination for decades\u201d. In a bruising three-month campaign, opponents of marriage equality claimed same-sex marriage would have far-reaching negative consequences for gender education and that religious freedom and freedom of speech were at risk. Despite assertions from Malcolm Turnbull that the survey would be overwhelmingly respectful, the campaign has been marred by homophobic incidents and campaign material which continued largely unabated despite a special law passed to apply electoral law safeguards to the survey. In lower house debate on Monday the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said the postal survey had \u201creawakened old fears\u201d in LGBTIQ Australians of \u201cbeing shunned by friends and family\u201d. Although he said the introduction of marriage equality was an \u201cuplifting moment\u201d, Shorten said parliamentarians should be humble and seek forgiveness from LGBTIQ people for \u201cinjustices and indignities\u201d in the debate and \u201cfor subjecting [them] and [their] relationships to public judgment\u201d. In his speech to the house, Turnbull credited the Australian people for the \u201cremarkable\u201d 80% turnout in the postal survey, adding that it had been a \u201cvery civil debate\u201d in which Australians had \u201cthrown their arms\u201d around gay people by voting yes."

As expected, 2017\u2019s power players triumphed at the ceremony. Christopher Bailey, who will leave Burberry in 2018 after 17 years, received a surprise award. The outstanding contribution to British fashion accolade was presented to him by Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue. Jonathan Anderson, who designed a collection for Uniqlo this year, won two awards \u2013 for the accessories he creates for the Spanish label Loewe and the British designer of the year (womenswear) for his JW Anderson brand. Gucci has been this year\u2019s runaway success story, with revenues up 49% in the third quarter of 2017. Marco Bizzarri, the brand\u2019s president and mastermind of the so-called Gucci-fi-cation of fashion, won the business leader award. Pat McGrath, the celebrated British makeup artist, received the Isabella Blow award for fashion curator. This has been a good year for McGrath, a respected innovator since the 90s. She launched the popular Pat McGrath Labs collection of cosmetics and was named British Vogue\u2019s beauty editor-at-large by the style bible\u2019s new editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful. The new more inclusive and creative mood of the industry was recognised. Aboah, who was on the cover of Enninful\u2019s first issue of Vogue and leads the feminist collective Gurls Talk, was named model of the year. The rising star Charles Jeffrey, who put men in ballgowns at his most recent show, received the emerging talent (menswear) prize. The award was presented to him by fellow designer and nightclub veteran John Galliano. Michael Halpern, the New York-born London-based designer, received the emerging talent (womenswear) prize for his sequinned party dresses worn by the likes of Amal Clooney. Craig Green, whose catwalk shows have featured wooden structures carried on the backs of male models, won British menswear designer of the year. International designers were also included. Raf Simons won designer of the year for his standout collections for Calvin Klein; Off-White won the urban luxe category. The label, which has gone from cult to mainstream this year, is designed by the Kanye West associate Virgil Abloh. The latest collection paid tribute to Princess Diana, with cycling short suits modelled by Naomi Campbell. Maria Grazia Chiuri, the creative director of Christian Dior since 2016, was given the Swarovski award for positive change. This was in recognition of her activism on the catwalk \u2013 most famously with the \u201cWe should all be feminists\u201d T-shirt she designed last year. \u201cThe feminist movement that has been mine for the longest time has finally struck a resonant chord in society,\u201d the designer said. It was also a night where longer-serving members of the fashion industry were awarded. Donatella Versace \u2013 who produced one of the most memorable fashion moments of the year when she put five of the original 90s supermodels on the catwalk in September \u2013 celebrates 20 years designing for Versace this year. She received the fashion icon award. And there was a tribute to Azzedine Ala\u00efa, the Paris-based Tunisian designer who died in November. Stella McCartney, who recently called for the industry to reduce textile production, was given the inaugural special recognition award for innovation. The chair of the British Fashion Council, Natalie Massenet, described McCartney as a fashion pioneer. The award was presented to the designer by the British inventor Sir James Dyson. This was the last Fashion Awards to have been overseen by Massenet. The businesswoman, who founded Net-a-Porter in 2000, was announced as non-executive chair of the online fashion retailer Farfetch in February. She will take up the role at the beginning of next year."
"1||L\u00e9o Bonatini downs Birmingham to give Wolves four-point lead at the topWolverhampton Wanderers stretched their lead at the top of the Championship to four points but, more significantly, to 10 points from third place as they proved they know how to win ugly. L\u00e9o Bonatini\u2019s early goal proved sufficient for a sixth successive victory to cement their mantle as title favourites. After the aesthetically pleasing thrashings of Leeds United and Bolton Wanderers at Molineux recently, Wolves had to dig a little deeper to see off Steve Cotterill\u2019s side, who stay in the relegation zone after Bonatini\u2019s goal was awarded on goalline technology. The dismissal of Harlee Dean, for a second yellow card, seven minutes from time helped give Wolves the advantage to see them over the line. Bonatini\u2019s eighth-minute volley was so narrowly over the line before Michael Morrison cleared that there was a delay before the gadget on Simon Hooper\u2019s wrist bleeped to indicate Wolves had taken the lead. But Birmingham should take great heart from their second-half showing, in which they edged possession even if their absence of a goal threat remains a concern. They have now scored only three goals from the nine games since Cotterill succeeded Harry Redknapp. \u201cWe\u2019re not full of goals whereas they\u2019ve got a front three who are full of goals,\u201d the Birmingham manager said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen them tear teams apart this season and they didn\u2019t do that to us. I think they were average tonight, Wolves. If we\u2019d got the first goal, it might have been different.\u201d Wolves have been scoring goals for fun and are on course to break the points record for the Championship. But they will be relieved to have survived this attritional West Midlands derby, in which their desire to head crosses clear and get a foot in was as important as the flowing football they displayed in the first half. The orange flares were soon ignited from visiting supporters \u2013 old gold were not available \u2013 in the Railway End as Wolves extinguished Birmingham\u2019s early bluster with the goal to confirm their superiority. David Stockdale, the Birmingham keeper, had already saved superbly from Ivan Cavaleiro in the same move and, on the rebound, even more impressively, from Diogo Jota before Bonatini\u2019s volley was confirmed a goal. It has been suggested that Wolves may succumb to a good physical prodding and Marc Roberts was fortunate that he had not already been cautioned for felling Jota when he took the same man out again to receive his yellow card. The game became more even for the rest of the half even if Wolves, lacking the composure of the suspended R\u00faben Neves in midfield, were allowed to break down the wings with remarkable ease at times. Birmingham did not raise the temperature until the second half, when they got forward more promptly having stiffened up the midfield. Wolves might have scored again, Jota and H\u00e9lder Costa sprinting through without managing to get a shot away, before the game started to boil over in a series of unseemly clashes. Alfred N\u2019Diaye, deputising for Neves, moved his head towards Maikel Kieftenbeld\u2019s and then slapped Stephen Gleeson. To Wolves\u2019 relief, the sanction was merely a caution apiece. But Birmingham were pressing at this stage, and belief started to echo around St Andrew\u2019s until Jota and Morrison tangled and Dean was dismissed for his shove on the Portuguese forward. \u201cIt was very weak, for Harlee Dean getting sent off,\u201d Cotterill said. \u201cHe\u2019s just moving Jota out the way so I\u2019m not sure he should fall to the floor like that. \u201cIf he\u2019s gone to the floor for that, then what about Kieftenbeld? That was a straight red for me \u2013 not another yellow. If Stephen Gleeson had gone to the floor, then you probably get a red card. But he\u2019s stayed on his feet, he\u2019s been honest.\u201d The Wolves head coach, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, said: \u201cWe deserved the win and we deserved the clean sheet because we defended very well. I\u2019m not against being aggressive as long as it is fair. But the referee refereed the game very well.\u201d"
"2||Richmond show part-time may be the way forward for Championship teamsIn rugby the scoreboard does not always tell the whole story. When Richmond beat Doncaster Knights 26-22 in the Championship last month, that was particularly true. The Yorkshire side are fully professional, the part-time Londoners train together only on Tuesday and Thursday nights. To date, the Knights have collected four league wins this season to Richmond\u2019s six. One intrigued observer at last month\u2019s game was Sam Edgerley, a Doncaster professional himself as recently as last season. Previously a member of the England Sevens squad who also once shared London Irish academy lodgings with Jonathan Joseph and Marland Yarde, Edgerley is now studying modern languages at Oxford University and starts at full-back for the Dark Blues in Thursday\u2019s Varsity Match at Twickenham. Next year he is poised to start work in the City and join the part-time brigade permanently. Which brings us to the fascinating bit: Edgerley firmly believes playing part-time can produce better, more fulfilled rugby players than if they were full-time pros. Yes, the 26-year-old\u2019s spare time now consists of micro-seconds but he feels totally liberated. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing professional rugby and that\u2019s all you\u2019re doing you can become very narrow-minded,\u201d he says. \u201cYou focus on the smallest details and, for me, it became all-consuming. I\u2019d be very self-critical of my performances.\u201d And now, amid all the competing demands of his \u201cother\u201d life? Totally different. \u201cIt allows you to express yourself on the field and not be too afraid. There\u2019s a big difference when you\u2019re playing just for a badge, rather than when there\u2019s a contract on the line. \u201cIt\u2019s been really refreshing just to play for my mates and play for a cause \u2026 to have a balance in your life rather than just a sole focus on rugby. The intensity of the academic side at Oxford is a big difference and a shock to the system but at the same time it is unbelievably rewarding. You\u2019re having to work every waking minute and rugby becomes your release.\u201d Richmond\u2019s director of rugby, Steve Hill, reckons Edgerley, once dubbed \u201cthe next Jason Robinson\u201d by an excited schoolboy coach, is by no means alone. Hill has to deal with problems encountered by none of his Premiership counterparts. For example, he says: \u201cLast week someone walked on to the railway line at Barnes; I have between 75 and 80 players training on Tuesday and Thursday nights and 25 were late, including a third of the first team,\u201d but believes less can often be more. \u201cMy experience of the ex-pro guys who have come to Richmond is that it really did refresh their love of the game. If you\u2019re a full-time sportsman, your life ultimately revolves around how well you\u2019re going and whether the team is winning. So much of that is out of your control.\u201d He cites another case study: his lock forward Chris Davies has just chalked up his 200th game for the club while holding down a senior executive role at Merrill Lynch. While Hill has to cut him some occasional slack \u2013 \u201che phones me on Monday and says: \u2018Steve, we\u2019ve all been called to a meeting in Milan, I\u2019m not going to make training\u2019\u201d \u2013 his team-mates are fully supportive. \u201cMy guys have got a different balance to their lives,\u201d continues Hill. \u201cIf they have a crap day at the office they can come down on Tuesday and Thursday nights and smack tackle shields all over the place.\u201d Which begs the current burning question: would all Championship sides be better off going semi-pro? Not just financially \u2013 no one makes any money in the Championship \u2013 but on all fronts? Several sides have been asking that question this season, with Bristol virtually guaranteed promotion before a ball was kicked and the old ring-fencing debate back up and running. \u201cBedford have got more non-full-time players this year than they\u2019ve ever had and are having their best season for four or five years,\u201d says Hill. \u201cNone of our players are full-time and one-third of London Scottish\u2019s squad this season are not full-time either. I\u2019m sure other clubs may begin to look at that.\u201d Clearly there are greater job opportunities in London than some other areas of the country but Edgerley fully concurs with Hill: \u201cWhen teams like Scottish and Richmond are doing it, it\u2019ll be potentially hard for others not to follow suit. When I went down to watch Doncaster at Richmond, it was really difficult for them. As a full-time side there is a pressure to take sides like that to the cleaners. It can be difficult to come up short against a team you know are training two nights a week when, for you, it\u2019s been your sole focus all week. \u201cTo see guys who have been working in the City all week come together and take down a full-time professional outfit \u2013 guys who have been training full-time, turning up in their compression leggings with their protein shakes \u2013 was incredible. I think it\u2019s an advert for the fact it is possible to do other things that give you a perspective and a critical distance from rugby.\u201d Indeed. No one is proposing a part-time Premiership but money, it seems, does not automatically buy oval-ball fulfilment. Generation game Perhaps the most successful footballing son of a rugby-playing father was Ryan Giggs, whose dad Danny Wilson played rugby union for Cardiff and rugby league for Swinton and Wales. The other way around is rarer, although Liam Botham, son of Ian (Scunthorpe United), did enjoy a successful spell in union for Cardiff. The latest wannabe is Jack Ramsay, son of the leading chef Gordon Ramsay who had trials for Glasgow Rangers in a previous life. Ramsay jnr, a flanker, is due to feature in the Champions\u2019 Trophy U18 schools final at Saracens\u2019 Allianz Park on Wednesday afternoon for Dulwich College against Blundell\u2019s. Good luck to all involved. One to watch The return of Champions Cup rugby this weekend will come as a slight relief to defending European champions Saracens, who have contrived to lose their last five games in all competitions. They entertain Clermont Auvergne, currently in eighth place in the Top 14 having failed to beat the league\u2019s bottom side Oyonnax in their last away fixture. Both sides will be keen to put their respective seasons back on track."
"6||US stock market hits record high after Trump tax bill success - as it happenedSo, not the most convincing rally we\u2019ve ever seen. And who can blame traders? There\u2019s plenty of reasons to be cautious, frankly - the stalling Brexit talks, the Michael Flynn situation, and the ongoing North Korean tensions for starters. Plus the fact that stock valuations do look a little high..... So we\u2019ll find out tomorrow whether the Trump bump continues, or if markets take a breather. Until then, goodnight, and thanks for reading. GW NEWSFLASH! America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average has closed at a new record high, thanks to optimism over Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. But....the rally did threaten to fizzle out. In the end, the Dow only gained around 58 points to 24,290 - a gain of 0.25%. That takes the blue-chip index to a new closing peak, extending the rally sine Trump won the US presidential election 13 months ago. Tech stocks had a bad day, dragging the Nasdaq down. The S&amp;P 500 also lost its early sparkle, and closed a little lower. Traders may have decided to \u2018sell the news\u2019 and bank profits, especially with other issues swirling over the White House.... Now this wasn\u2019t in the script. With 15 minutes to go, the rally is running out of puff. The S&amp;P 500 is now pretty-much flat, and the Dow is shedding some of its gains too - now up just 0.3%. The tech selloff seems to be responsible. Technology stocks are still refusing to join the rally. The tech-focused Nasdaq index is down almost 1% today, partly due to big names like PayPal (down 5.8%), Adobe (down 5.6%) and NVIDIA (down 5.1%). The chatter on Wall Street is that investors are moving out of tech, and into financial stocks, consumer-focused companies and industrial companies today. With around 90 minutes trading to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is toying with a new closing high. The Dow is up 160 points at 24,391, as traders keep giving the tax reforms push a thumbs-up (despite the reservations we\u2019ve already flagged up). Disney is the top riser, up almost 5%. That\u2019s due to reports that talks have resumed with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox to buy some of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets. Boeing are next on the Dow risers chart, up 3%, followed by chemicals giant DowDuPont (+2.6%) and JPMorgan Chase (+2.5%). Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, isn\u2019t terribly impressed by today\u2019s stock market rally. It\u2019s all so terribly short term, he writes... Once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Here\u2019s Nils\u2019 column: The US stock market rally could head even higher, if the two houses of Congress can agree a final tax bill. Mike Bell of JP Morgan believes the tax trade has more legs, adding (via the FT): We estimate that the market is only pricing in about a 50% probability of tax cuts and that if a tax plan is finalised this would push US equities higher. The Dow Jones continues to enjoy a good day, up around 200 points at 24,430. Financial stocks are still leading the charge, up 1.7%. But tech stocks aren\u2019t coming to the party. Facebook and Google are both down 0.5% while Microsoft has shed 2%. European stock markets have closed higher tonight, led by Germany: The eurozone\u2019s finance ministers have elected a new leader - Portugal\u2019s Mario Centeno. So his predecessor Jeroen Dijsselbloem really did give the game away earlier when he described Centeno as his successor, before the vote had even taken place..... It\u2019s official - no Brexit breakthrough today. The pound is now dropping back, after DUP leader (and Theresa May ally) Arlene Foster warned that her party wouldn\u2019t accept any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. That could be a spanner in the works for May\u2019s Brexit breakthrough..... It has nudged sterling back below $1.35, and wiping out most of today\u2019s gains. Wall Street investors are hoping that a final tax deal can be done soon (ironing out differences between the Senate and the House of Representatives). Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, explains (via Marketwatch): \u201cGetting the tax plan done will still be a challenge, but it doesn\u2019t seem as impossible as it once did, and now there\u2019s optimism that it could happen before the end of the year, which means it could be made retroactive and change the liability for companies and individuals for this year as well as next, which would be a positive. Here\u2019s a sobering thought. Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has predicted that thousands of Americans will die early, if the tax changes approved by the Senate go through. CNBC has the details: About 10,000 Americans will die every year from lack of health coverage if the tax reform bill goes through as proposed, Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary and White House economic advisor under Barack Obama, said Monday. Citing studies on what happens to people who go from being insured to uninsured, Summers said the estimate is likely conservative. \u201cI think this bill is very dangerous,\u201d he said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d program. \u201cWhen people lose health insurance, they\u2019re less likely to get preventive care, they\u2019re more likely to defer health care they need, and ultimately they\u2019re more likely to die.\u201d Reports are coming through that the Eurogroup has approved the policy package agreed over the weekend by Athens and its creditors. The county\u2019s leading daily, Kathimerini, says Euro group chairman, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, welcomed the deal ahead of the meeting telling the assembled media \u201cit was exceptional\u201d it had been agreed in time. The deal paves the way to Greece receiving fresh rescue funds from its current and third international bailout pushing the country inexorably towards self-finance when the \u20ac86bn rescue programme officially expires next August. Stocks are racing higher in New York, as traders cheer the US Senate\u2019s tax vote. The Dow Jones has now gained an impressive 300 points, or 1.2%, to 24,532. That shows that Wall Street is applauding the prospect of corporation tax being cut from 35% to around 20%. Walt Disney is the biggest gainer, up 3.8% (readers should insert their own joke about the financial markets being a Mickey Mouse operation). Aeroplane maker Boeing are up 3.3%, with financial stocks and basic materials companies also having a good day. Before we get carried away, let\u2019s remember that barely half of all Americans own stocks (either individual shares or through retirement accounts). Inevitably, they will be the wealthier members of society -- who are also in the front line to benefit from Trump\u2019s tax changes (as this charts showed). Gallup reported earlier this year that stock ownership has contracted since the financial crisis, especially among younger and less-wealthy Americans. But share ownership has held firm among Adults aged 65 and older and those with an annual household income of at least $100,000. Boom! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a fresh record high in early trading. The Dow jumped by 244 points to 24,475, a gain of around 1%, as New York traders applaud the prospect of tax reform legislation hitting the statute book. The S&amp;P 500, which tracks a broader group of US companies, is also at record levels. Arnaud Masset of Swissquote bank says corporate America approves of Trump\u2019s efforts: Tax reform is popular with US businesses. The proposed law could reduce corporate tax rates to 20% (compared to 35% currently) and cut individual taxes too. Today, the honour of ringing the Wall Street opening bell goes to Groupon, the deals website.... There\u2019s quite a festive mood on Wall Street today, partly thanks to the impressive Christmas tree outside the New York Stock Exchange. New York traders should prepare for a lively opening, when trading begins on Wall Street in 30 minutes. A fresh record high looks nailed on, following the Senate\u2019s tax approval vote. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explain: The Dow Jones is set to strap a rocket to its back after the bell, with the futures pointing to a 220 point surge. That\u2019d leave the Dow at \u2013 what else \u2013 a fresh all time high of around 24450, already making last Friday\u2019s FBI-revelations inspired panic a distant memory. The pound has now hit a six-month high against a basket of currencies. Elsewhere in Brussels, eurozone finance ministers are gathering for a eurogroup meeting. They\u2019ll be electing their next president, to succeed Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Officially it\u2019s a close contest, with four candidates throwing their caps into the ring: Although, the chat may be out of the sac.... It could also be a big day for Greece, with the leftist-led government presenting the deal it has reached in ongoing bailout negotiations with creditor. Athens officials hope for a warm reception from the euro group, marking the beginning of the end of international surveillance for debt-stricken Greece. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: With a compliance review completed in record time over the weekend, the Greek finance minister Euclid Tskakalotos will present the deal (referred to as staff level agreement) to euro area finance ministers today. The policy package, a key part of the country\u2019s third bailout programme review, must be approved by the euro group before another tranche of aid worth \u20ac5bn can be released to Greece. If rubber-stamped today \u2013 less than two months after talks began - the disbursement could be made in January. \u201cAlthough a lot of the measures are sensitive the real news is that the agreement was concluded in record time,\u201d said one insider. \u201cIt is recognised that we are committed to exiting the [bailout] programme.\u201d It\u2019s not all plain sailing. Under the deal, which covered issues ranging from energy and labour market reforms, bad loans and privatisations and tax measures, Greece will have to implement around 100 \u2018prior actions\u2019 or reforms by January. The demand that Athens presses ahead with more foreclosures \u2013 a necessary evil if banks are to deal with the highest non-performing loan ratio in the euro zone \u2013 is particularly sensitive. Many Greeks, unable to keep up with bank payments, fear they could lose their homes. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government is especially keen to wrap up the review (and negotiations more generally with creditors) so it can exit the \u20ac86bn bailout programme, the country\u2019s third, next summer. Only one more bailout review remains and once that is concluded debt relief talks can begin. The government is betting on debt relief helping it win a fresh term in office (despite lagging drastically in the polls). Here\u2019s a neat chart, showing how morale in Britain\u2019s construction and manufacturing sectors picked up in November. Tomorrow we discover if the service sector also had a good month. The pound has now hit a one-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.1415, thanks to those reports of a deal over the Irish border. Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, says investors are hoping for a significant Brexit breakthrough: \u201cIt is understood that Prime Minister Theresa May has conceded ground to the EU around the Irish border and the final divorce bill for leaving the EU, which have been sticking points for both sides for months. Despite the fine details of a draft agreement unlikely to be resolved until next week, the pound will be buoyed by the news that, for the time being, it looks like the EU will vote in favour of progressing talks to the next phase.\u201d But.... there\u2019s confusion over whether Britain is really offering \u201cno divergence\u201d on regulations, as some MEPs said, or simply \u201ccontinued regulatory compliance\u201d. The final decision will be crucial. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: The president is up, and predicting a Wall Street rally today: Sterling is pushing higher against the euro and the US dollar, following reports that Britain and the EU are close to a breakthrough. After a slow start, the pound is now up half a cent against the dollar at $1.352. Against the euro, it\u2019s gained three-quarters of a eurocent at \u20ac1.14. It follows reports that Britain has made a key concession over the Irish border. According to MEPs, the UK has offered no divergence between Northern Ireland the Republic over single market and customs union rules. Irish broadcaster RTE says it would have \u201cfar-reaching implications\u201d. But it\u2019s not clear that Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP party would accept it -- which is significant, as they\u2019re currently propping up Theresa May\u2019s government. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the action in his Politics Live blog: The loudest complaint against Trump\u2019s tax \u2018reforms\u2019 is that the richest Americans will benefit the most. And yesterday, the bi-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed very clearly that this is true: Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned that the US budget deficit could spiral to $1 trillion by the end of the decade, thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s tax shake-up. He fears it will precede a squeeze on government spending, potentially hurting welfare spending. Economics lecturer Stephen Kinsella of Ireland\u2019s University of Limerick agrees that the fiscal axe will soon fall on US government spending. A bit of work still needs to be done before Donald Trump can sign off a tax reform bill. That\u2019s because the Senate and the House of Representatives (America\u2019s upper and lower chambers) have both passed different legislation. The two versions now need to be merged, starting today - creating an opportunity for lawmakers to raise objections. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: It is by no means a done deal given that the Senate bill is different to the one passed by Congress in November which means any final version is likely to be revised, and then passed by both houses, before being sent for signature by the President. What is unlikely to change are the headline numbers, which means that we can expect to see the corporation tax rate number reduced substantially from its current 35% to as low as 20%. After a stellar year, world stock markets are closing in on a new record -- $100 trillion! Over in New York, Wall Street traders will be waking up to predictions of another record-breaking open in four hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is forecast to jump by over 200 points, following the Senate\u2019s approval of US tax reforms over the weekend. It means the long rally since Trump\u2019s shock election win will continue.... Barbara Kollmeyer of Marketwatch puts it: The gains came as investors shifted their focus away from political tensions in Washington and cheered weekend news that Senate Republicans passed a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code..... Hopes that the Trump administration and Republicans would usher in a business-friendly tax overhaul have been a driver for the stock market\u2019s record-setting streak over the past year. The House and Senate now must agree on a single tax bill before it can be sent to Trump to sign. Blane Perrotton, managing director of the national surveyors Naismiths, says UK housebuilders are feeling more upbeat. \u201cAfter the Autumn Budget, developers feel like they have the Government behind them and that is further boosting confidence and activity levels. \u201cResidential development is certainly the most active it has been since before the Global Financial Crisis. \u201cOn the frontline we\u2019re seeing a huge amount of activity, especially among small and mid-sized developers, who are making the most of the vastly increased finance options available. This jump in the UK\u2019s construction PMI is a little surprising, says Max Jones of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. Jones reckons confidence among builders is quite \u2018brittle, adding: \u201cAnecdotal feedback indicates that margins are coming under pressure with competition increasing amid the ongoing economic uncertainty. Larger firms also feel caught in the middle between clients pushing for fixed-price contracts and investors hungry for fatter margins. Construction bosses are also worried that the might struggle to find enough skilled labour after Brexit, Jones adds - although others are keen to invest in their UK workforce. Breaking: Britain\u2019s construction sector grew at its fastest rate in five months in November. Markit\u2019s latest PMI survey shows that housebuilding picked up last month, bringing some relief to Britain\u2019s builders after an autumn slowdown. That pushed the construction PMI up to 53.1, up from October\u2019s 50.8. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this is an encouraging signal. Here are the key findings: Residential work drives modest construction rebound in November Commercial and civil engineering activity continue to decline Business optimism picks up from October\u2019s near five-year low Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, blames political uncertainty for the slowdown in commercial construction activity and civil engineering work: \u201cUK construction companies experienced a solid yet uneven improvement in business conditions during November. Once again, resilient house building growth helped to offset lower volumes of commercial work and civil engineering activity. \u201cSurvey respondents noted that residential projects underpinned the rebound in total new order growth to its strongest since June, helped by strong demand fundamentals and a supportive policy backdrop. \u201cConstruction firms reported that heightened economic and political uncertainty continued to hold back commercial development activity. The latest drop in civil engineering was linked to a recent lack of tender opportunities for infrastructure-related projects. Trump\u2019s push to cut America\u2019s corporation from 35% to 20% could encourage US companies to repatriate some of their immense overseas cash piles. Fortune Magazine says this is a victory for tech giants, who have lobbied hard on this issue: Tech companies like Apple and Microsoft have for a long time balked at the 35% corporate tax the current tax code requires them to pay on worldwide profits returned to the U.S. To avoid paying, the companies have parked as much of their profit as possible in overseas subsidiaries in countries like Bermuda and Ireland, where tax rates are low. The Big 5 tech companies\u2013Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft\u2013currently have a combined $457 billion held in overseas subsidiaries. Apple holds more profits overseas than any other company, with Microsoft not far behind. More here: Big Tech\u2019s Lobbying Splurge Is About To Pay Off With The Tax Vote Europe\u2019s stock markets are recovering from Friday\u2019s shock news that former Trump advisor Michael Flynn had pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \u201cEuropean markets are playing catch up after closing at the depths of the Friday market meltdown on Michael Flynn concerns and embracing the weekend\u2019s senate tax bill success. The pro-business tax cuts look set to boost US economic growth and have provided further impetus for US and global valuations. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is up this morning. Multinational equipment rental firm Ashtead Group is leading the way, up 3.5%, followed by cruise company Carnival and plumbing and heating firm Ferguson. Ashtead and Ferguson both have big operations in America, so would benefit if Trump\u2019s tax reforms do deliver a growth burst. All the major European stock markets are up this morning, after the US Senate approved the tax reform package over the weekend. The German DAX is leading the charge, up over 1%, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 and the French CAC close behind. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: The U.S. Senate\u2019s approval to pass the tax cut bill on Saturday overshadowed the continuing investigation into connections between U.S. President\u2019s inner circle and Russia. The US dollar has jumped by 0.5% against a basket of currencies this morning, reports Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets in Europe and America are set to rally today, after Donald Trump took a massive step towards shaking up the US tax system. In Trump\u2019s first legislative triumph, the Senate finally passed the president\u2019s long-awaited tax reform bill. The move means the president can look forward to signing off a final bill on tax reform soon. The reforms include a hefty cut to US corporation tax, down from 35% to 20%, bringing America into line with other advanced economies. There are also sweeping changes to individual tax rates - which Trump claims will make people \u201cvery, very happy\u2019. But...the \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d plan to cut taxes for \u201caverage Americans\u201d has been criticised by experts who say it\u2019s a shameless giveaway of wealth to the richest 1%. Republicans claim that the $1.4tn package of cuts can be funded through growth; but an independent committee found it could add $1 trillion to the national debt. Democrats, though, slammed the changes as a giveaway to corporate America and the wealthy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declared: \u201cIn the waning hours, this bill is tilting further towards businesses and away from families. \u201cEvery time the choice is between corporations and families, the Republicans choose corporations.\u201d But the financial world is welcoming the Senate vote, despite the pressure building on the White House over links with Russia. Today, Wall Street is tipped to open strongly, possibly driving the Dow Jones to a new all-time high. The FTSE 100 has already reacted, jumping by 60 points to 7360 at the start of trading in London. But sterling is under pressure this morning as Theresa May heads to Brussels for crunch talks with the EU. The pound has shed almost half a cent at $1.343, amid reports that London and Dublin haven\u2019t (yet) reached an agreement on the Irish border. As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reported last night: Theresa May and the Irish government have failed to reach a deal on the crucial Brexit issue of the Northern Ireland border ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday lunchtime with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Despite intense efforts over the weekend to agree a proposal on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Irish officials revealed at midnight on Sunday that \u201cthere is still a way to go\u201d to achieve a meeting of minds on the issue. But there could be plenty of drama in Brussels, as Britain pushes for a breakthrough that would pave the way for trade talks. Also coming up today, we get a new health check on Britain\u2019s builders (who have been struggling in recent months) plus the latest eurozone investor confidence index and US factory orders figures. Here\u2019s the agenda 9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI for October 9.30am GMT: Eurozone Sentix investor confidence report 3pm GMT: US factory orders for October"
"7||NFL player Malcolm Jenkins won't protest anymore. That's for the bestMalcolm Jenkins, the Philadelphia Eagles safety and face of the Players Coalition, said this week that he would end his practice of raising his right fist during the playing of the star-spangled banner, after the NFL agreed to provide $89m to programs promoting the goals the coalition wants to achieve. While there is so much to write about the details surrounding the deal struck between the Players Coalition and the NFL, I want to focus on Malcolm Jenkins and why I agree with his abandonment of raising his fist during the playing of the national anthem. To do so I\u2019m going to, as he posted on Twitter, go back to \u201cwhere we began\u201d for him (and the Players Coalition) \u2013 his ride along with the Philadelphia police department. While combing over the comments made by Jenkins in the article attached to his 30 November tweet, where he reminded followers about his entry point into fighting for social justice, Jenkins admits that \u201cluckily\u201d he had \u201cvery, very few interactions with officers\u201d in his life. This is an anomaly in the lives of many black people in America, and specifically in Philadelphia. A recent study shows us that predominately black neighborhoods in Philadelphia drew 70% more frisks than non-black areas, yet yielded less contraband, and that the elevated rate of frisking was consistent regardless of whether the majority black neighborhood was a high-crime area or a very low-crime area. Jenkins said: \u201cThere\u2019s tons of people outside, but nobody wants to get involved. They don\u2019t feel like the police are there to protect them, so they don\u2019t give information. The officers are mad because they\u2019re trying to clean up the streets \u2026 but there\u2019s no cooperation. It was an eye-opening experience\u201d. Maybe, \u201cthe people\u201d disproportionately policed in Philadelphia don\u2019t feel like the officers are there to better their communities, not only because of rampant racially biased stop-and-frisk tactics. Maybe many of those residents remember 13 May 1985, when the police dropped a bomb in a west Philadelphia neighborhood, leaving residents like Steve Harmon retelling the terror saying: \u201cDrop a bomb on a residential area? I never in my life heard of that. It\u2019s like Vietnam\u201d. No. It was not Vietnam. It was a black neighborhood in America. The bombs were dropped on the black liberation group Move, and any other non-Move affiliated children, women and men in the vicinity. Move members were often photographed raising their black fist. Conceivably, Jenkins was unaware of the historical significance of raising the black fist as a symbol of resistance, strength and solidarity in the face of oppression. While raising a black fist will always be connected to the iconic image of athlete-activists Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Olympics, it will also always be associated with the Black Panther party for self-defense (BPP) \u2013 a group that was seen by J Edgar Hoover as \u201cwithout question \u2026 the greatest threat to internal security of the country\u201d for providing impoverished youths with hot meals via their Free Children\u2019s Breakfast Program. We are also talking about the same Black Panther party that was known for exercising their second amendment rights, and taking up arms in defense against police brutality, as they would regularly show up during police encounters with members of the black community, stand at a legal distance, and surveil their interactions to ensure that nothing illegal would take place. The Black Panthers (and others raising their black fist as a political symbol) did not do ride-alongs with the police \u2013 they policed the police, or rode in police cars involuntarily, because they were arrested. I did not write this piece to frame Jenkins as \u201csell-out\u201d. No, on the contrary, I thank him for no longer raising his fist as a sign of protest. The historical associations of that gesture with regards to black protest are not reflective of the politics he has displayed. Because as Malcolm Jenkins has made apparent, his most \u201ceye opening experiences\u201d during the past two years have been participating in a ride along with the police, meeting with members of Congress in Washington DC and most recently striking an $89m partnering with the NFL owners. I am not passing judgment, but clearly these moves are in no way aligned with individuals and groups like the Black Panther party, which argued that the economic and political roots of racism were tethered to (what they believed was) the exploitative nature of capitalist systems, and that the black struggle for liberation must be a revolutionary movement to overthrow the entire power structure in order to secure true freedom. Jenkins rode with the police, partnered with wealthy billionaire, capitalist NFL owners, and is working with Congress \u2013 those are not black-fist raising actions. That\u2019s why I am pleased to see Jenkins no longer raising his fist. Ameer Hasan Loggins is a doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley"
"7||How best to silence the powerless? Play\u00a0the victimTwo months after the New York Times\u2019s first story about Harvey Weinstein, a pattern has been established. A woman steps forward to claim that she has been the victim of sexual harassment. Almost immediately, the accused \u2013 or a man speaking on his behalf \u2013 responds with talk of a witch-hunt. Last week it was the turn of Australian TV presenter Don Burke to deny claims that he is a sexual predator and to say he is being unfairly targeted. The week before, the singer Morrissey, in his now-familiar role as professional provocateur, had his say on the sexual abuse story, asserting that \u201canyone who ever said \u2018I like you\u2019 to someone else is suddenly being charged with sexual harassment\u201d. In recent days the Tory MP Sir Roger Gale also talked of a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d while Jeremy Clarkson warned darkly of \u201cinnocent men forced to live like hermits\u201d. Now deputy prime minister Damian Green has been defended by his friend and fellow MP Crispin Blunt, along with the Daily Mail, which is claiming the first minister of state is the victim of a \u201ccynical vendetta\u201d being waged by the police. Meanwhile in the US, Jerry Moore, brother of Roy, the Republican Alabama senate candidate accused of abusing underage girls, claimed his sibling was being persecuted \u201clike Jesus\u201d. Powerful people have often defended their privilege by accusing their critics of the politics of envy. Now, in a weird transposition, the status of victim seems to have become desirable. As a way of holding on to power, the powerful are claiming victimhood themselves. Victim envy isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. I first encountered it in 1998 when the Guardian sent me to interview Binjamin Wilkomirski, author of an acclaimed memoir of his experience as a child survivor of Majdanek concentration camp. It later emerged that he was actually Bruno D\u00f6ssekker, a Swiss Protestant who\u2019d never been near Majdanek but was one of a growing band of wannabe survivors who had alighted on the Holocaust as a place to park their sense of grievance. More recently, Rachel Dolezal was revealed to be not the black activist she claimed to be, but a disappointed white woman who had sued an American university for discriminating against her because she was white. You could argue, if you were being charitable, that these are troubled people looking for a place where their pain gets a sympathetic hearing. But you wouldn\u2019t want to extend that same charity to Donald Trump when he suggested that he was Charlottesville\u2019s real victim. Or to the white nationalist Richard Spencer when he bewails the \u201cdispossessed white race\u201d. These examples are proof of the saying: \u201cTo the privileged, equality is oppression.\u201d Such people see all action to address inequality in zero-sum terms: any gain by previously less powerful groups inevitably means a loss for those who have been more powerful in the past. The post-Weinstein revelations, and the reactions to them, have been an instructive display of the ways in which the powerful undermine and shut down their victims. Once women started speaking out about sexual harassment, refusing to be silent, new ways needed to be found to delegitimise them. One weapon of choice was the \u201csnowflake\u201d line: women had overreacted to mere \u201cfondles\u201d and gropes. The other strategy has been for those accused of harassment to flip the whole thing over and claim victimhood for themselves. So how do we counter victim envy? One way is to call it out whenever it occurs, making #victimenvy a cousin of #MeToo. Another is to adopt the tactics of the powerful and ridicule the Trumps and the Spencers when they portray themselves as victims. The French have a good sign on their disabled parking places: Si vous prenez ma place prenez aussi mon handicap \u2013 \u201cIf you take my space, take my disability, too.\u201d Perhaps a more pithy rejoinder to those powerful individuals and groups who claim victimhood is just: diddums. \u2022 Anne Karpf is the author of The Human Voice and How To Age"
"8||Brexiter Tories back DUP position on Irish border issueBrexit-backing Conservative MPs have lined up to echo the warning of Democratic Unionist party leader, Arlene Foster, that \u201cany form of regulatory divergence\u201d between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would be an unacceptable concession in Brexit negotiations. Several Tory politicians were quick to swing behind their Northern Irish allies on whom they depend for a parliamentary majority after the DUP intervention appeared to scupper any hopes held by Theresa May of completing the first stage of talks with the EU27 on Monday. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, told the Guardian: \u201cThe prime minister is fully aware that when it comes to the border issue Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK and therefore there cannot be any regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg said: \u201cThe Conservative and Unionist party has a similar view of the union to that of the DUP.\u201d Their comments followed leaks to the media suggesting the UK government had been on the brink of an agreement in which it would accept \u201ccontinued regulatory alignment\u201d between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. That suggestion triggered the DUP\u2019s intervention, with the prime minister taking a break from critical negotiations in Brussels to discuss the issue with Foster over the phone, before accepting that a deal would not be completed that day. Senior government sources stressed that the leak to the broadcaster RTE was not quite correct and argued that there was a difference between issues of \u201calignment\u201d and \u201cdivergence\u201d. They said that even with agreement on the border, there remained a further sticking point over the role of the European court of justice in the question of EU citizen rights. However, one Whitehall source made clear that the DUP intervention was critical given that May\u2019s majority is based on a confidence and supply agreement with the party. \u201cWe need their votes,\u201d they admitted. Several Tory MPs expressed alarm about the leaks during a meeting at Westminster with the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, and the Brexit minister Steve Baker. During the meeting, Theresa Villiers, the Brexit-backing former Northern Ireland secretary, asked whether alignment was a possibility, but sources said the reply was non-committal. Rees-Mogg made clear that there could be no difference between different parts of the UK and that Britain as a whole needed to have the freedom to diverge from the EU on regulations after Brexit. \u201cWe cannot align the regulation of one part of the United Kingdom with the European Union. If we align the whole of the United Kingdom, then we haven\u2019t left the European Union so there is a logical impossibility of doing what the Irish government proposes,\u201d he told reporters after the meeting. Rees-Mogg said the DUP and the Tories were in total agreement \u2013 as he stressed the support of the Northern Irish party was necessary to maintain the government\u2019s majority in the House of Commons. \u201cGavin Barwell made it absolutely clear. As he said, we are not going to trade on distinctions between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That would be completely intolerable. We are the Conservative and Unionist party after all.\u201d Rees-Mogg called the leaked document \u201cpropaganda from the Irish government\u201d. There was mixed reaction to No 10\u2019s attempts to reassure colleagues. One source said they had been persuaded by Barwell\u2019s argument that the mention of alignment was only in relation to the \u201cunlikely\u201d scenario in which the UK crashed out of the EU because of failure to achieve an agreement on trade. Barwell is thought to have presented the scenario as a contingency or backstop that would secure a soft border in the event of that extreme outcome. Another MP joked that the meeting had been about as enlightening as \u201ca lightbulb switching off and plunging us into darkness\u201d. Villiers argued that despite the difficulties on Monday, she felt hopeful about a deal being imminent. \u201cGenuinely it is positive that the two sides are now pretty close together on all sorts of difficult issues and that demonstrates that hopefully there is a good chance of moving on to stage two of the process. Clearly there are two significant issues [the border question and the ECJ] that are still to be resolved,\u201d she said. Others in the room who supported remain in the referendum were prepared for May to offer concessions. One leave-supporting Conservative MP insisted they were not overly alarmed about the idea of a small amount of regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. \u201cThey seem to be talking about a particular set of rules, not the entire single market. No 10 was quite reassuring that it would all be worked out later somewhere down the line. It doesn\u2019t seem to be enough for the DUP but we know both they and the Irish government play hardball in their negotiations. So it is not clear whether their outrage is genuine or not,\u201d they said. MP Anna Soubry, the former Tory minister, said a simple solution to the Irish border issue would be for the UK to stay in the single market and the customs union. \u201cNobody could want one part of our country to have a different set of rules to another part of the country. On that, Jacob and I are absolutely agreed,\u201d Soubry said. \u201cThe sense in the room is that nobody wanted that. If we stay in the single market, that solves the problem.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 December 2017 because an earlier version referred to Anna Soubry as a former cabinet minister."
"8||Irish PM says he is 'disappointed' UK backed off a deal it had approved - as it happenedI am closing this liveblog now. Thank you so much for joining us and thanks to all those who took the time to comment. My colleagues Daniel Boffey, Jennifer Rankin and Anushka Asthana have this report on the day\u2019s events. Theresa May\u2019s political weakness was brutally exposed to Brussels on Monday as an agreement struck between Britain and the EU to solve the problem of the Irish border and move to the next phase of Brexit talks was torpedoed by a last-minute telephone call with the leader of the Democratic Unionist party. Live Irish PM says he is \u2018disappointed\u2019 UK backed off a deal it had approved - Politics liveRolling coverage of the day\u2019s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May\u2019s meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker intended to conclude phase one of the Brexit talks and MPs debating the EU withdrawal bill. Confidence early on Monday that an agreement was within reach came to nothing when, during a working lunch with the European commission president, Jean Claude Juncker, May was forced to pause discussions to take a call from Arlene Foster. The unionist leader, whose party currently provides the Tories with a working majority in the Commons, told the British prime minister that she could not support Downing Street\u2019s planned commitment to keep Northern Ireland aligned with EU laws. Read the full story here: Meanwhile, Dan Roberts our Brexit policy editor explains what it could all mean with this analysis piece: May told the Press Association that the meeting with Juncker had been \u201cconstructive\u201d, despite no deal being reached. She added: On a couple of issues some differences do remain which require further negotiation and consultation and those will continue. But we will reconvene before the end of the week and I am also confident that we will conclude this positively. Jim Pickard, chief political correspondent for the Financial Times, says that some Tory MPs are wondering if more money can be given to the DUP for them to agree to the deal. My colleagues Jon Henley, Jennifer Rankin and Lisa O\u2019Carroll have put together this explainer on the key sticking points that are holding the Brexit negotiations up. While the Irish border remains the main roadblock in the path to the next phase of talks, citizens\u2019 rights and the financial settlement are also key issues that need to be resolved. Read the full story here: Here\u2019s how key members of the remain and leave camps reacted to the deal falling through today. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage called for May to \u201cleave office now\u201d, saying that proposals for regulatory alignment in Ireland were \u201ca bitter betrayal\u201d. \u201cTheresa May has got to go,\u201d said Farage. \u201cIf we want to leave the EU, she\u2019s got to leave office now.\u201d The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, blamed the failure to make progress on the \u201cgrubby deal\u201d with the DUP. He said: The real reason for today\u2019s failure is the grubby deal the government did with the DUP after the election ... Each passing day provides further evidence that Theresa May\u2019s government is completely ill-equipped to negotiate a successful Brexit deal for our country. DUP MP and Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said regulatory alignment was \u201csimply EU-speak for keeping Northern Ireland inside customs union and inside the single market\u201d. He went on: [Treating Northern Ireland differently] will have huge implications for her whole negotiating stance and if she gives in on special demands for Northern Ireland then she will be giving in on special demands for Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom. It\u2019s a unionist nightmare. Remain supporter Anna Soubry, a Tory MP, said that no Conservatives wanted Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK. The \u201csimple solution\u201d would be for the whole of the UK to remain in the single market and customs union, she said. The executive director of the Open Britain campaign against hard Brexit, James McGrory, agreed: There is a solution that would solve all of these problems for the government, which is to keep the whole of the UK in the single market and the customs union. That would avoid a hard border in Ireland, ensure a level playing field for businesses across our islands, and protect trade with the EU, which buys almost half of everything we export. A spokesman for the Leave Means Leave campaign, which is backed by many senior Tory Brexiteers, said: We welcome confirmation from the Prime Minister, at the earliest opportunity, that she will completely rule out any proposal to treat Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the United Kingdom. Eloise Todd, of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said it seemed clear that Arlene Foster and the DUP were calling the shots and now are running the government. She added: Labour and Conservative remain-minded MPs outnumber this sad little rump by more than 10 to one. It is time for these people to stand up and make themselves heard. Fintan O\u2019Toole, columnist the Irish Times, says Brexiters have underestimated the Irish border issue. There may be some way to go, but today we moved much closer to a British climbdown on the question of the Irish border after Brexit. And this will turn an acrimonious debate on its head. So far, we\u2019ve been talking about the implications of Brexit for Ireland. Now we have to talk about the implications of Ireland for Brexit. It is not just that Britain\u2019s weakness in its negotiations with the European Unionhas been made even more starkly clear. On the three issues on which \u201csufficient progress\u201d had to be made \u2013 people, money and Ireland \u2013 Britain seems likely to suffer a hat-trick of defeats. Its concessions in the talks on the border issue are not yet official, and may seem more abstract and less visceral than its retreats on the divorce bill and the rights of EU citizens in the UK; but they may prove to be much more fundamental and much more problematic for the whole Brexit project. There is a sense here of the return of the repressed: the Brexiters pretended Ireland did not exist; now it has come back to haunt their grand schemes. Read the full opinion piece here: Despite his mixed reputation in London, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has a habit of signalling when it time to show his understanding of British tastes: a rather well-worn Burberry print tie. It was there in May when he first travelled to Downing Street for dinner, and again a year earlier, during a commission press conference ahead of the EU referendum. On Monday, the tie looked a crisp as ever as he greeted the prime minister for lunch on his turf, even if the egg was everywhere else. If you are just catching up with this afternoon\u2019s Brexit drama, here is a summary of what happened: Theresa May went to Brussels today for a key lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission. It was widely anticipated that the lunch would conclude phase one of the Brexit negotiations ahead of next week\u2019s EU summit. It was thought that both sides would finally agree on the crucial issues of citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border. Leaked proposals suggested May was planning to agree that Northern Ireland would remain \u201caligned\u201d with EU laws in the future to avoid a hard border following an agreement with the Irish Republic. Within minutes of the agreement being made public, the DUP insisted both publicly and in a call with May, that they had not agreed to it. Scotland, Wales and London all united in demanding same EU deal as Northern Ireland. In a press conference following the lunch, Juncker announced that despite their best efforts, \u201cit was not possible to reach a complete agreement today.\u201d May added that two main issues remain unresolved. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg said the deal had been \u201csunk\u201d by the DUP, which reacted angrily to reports of concessions on the Irish border issue and whose support May is relying on in parliament. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, announced he was \u201cdisappointed and surprised\u201d that the draft text agreed by Dublin was not signed off by the UK and EU today. He said May agreed a deal she could not subsequently deliver. You can read the full story here: This is Nicola Slawson taking over from Andrew Sparrow. The Liberal Democrats are unimpressed with Theresa May\u2019s performance today. They are also calling for a second referendum on the Brexit deal, when the deal is finally decided presumably. Tom Brake, the party\u2019s Brexit spokesperson, said: Once again Theresa May has come out of Brexit talks with her tail between her legs. It is the same old story, another day, another failed negotiation with the EU. This government have now realised that Brexit Britain isn\u2019t going to be a land of milk and honey. This whole situation could have been solved by keeping the entire country in the single market and the customs union. Instead Theresa May has cowered in front of her backbenchers and driven forward a reckless Brexit which risks destabilising the whole UK. As each day goes by, it becomes clearer that the best deal for everyone is to stay in Europe. The people of the UK must be given a vote on the deal and an opportunity to exit from Brexit. This is from Colum Eastwood, leader of the nationalist SDLP party in Northern Ireland: For months, the SDLP has been making the case that the only way to avoid a hard border and a hard Brexit on the island of Ireland is to maintain membership of the single market and the customs union. However you want to label it, the end result must be the same. Reports today that the UK could concede the principle that there must be \u2018continued regulatory alignment\u2019 with the rules of the single market and the customs union across Ireland, particularly in areas of north/Ssuth cooperation is a positive move. The Brexit negotiations must be driven by the best interests of people on these islands, not by narrow isolationist ideology. All steps must be taken to protect the north\u2019s economy, our political progress and the terms of the Good Friday agreement. That has long been the position of the European Union. It is welcome that the British government now seems to be accepting that position. The DUP now must move to act in Northern Ireland\u2019s interest, not simply serve the their own interests. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Nicola Slawson is now taking over. At the meeting for backbench Conservative MPs with the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff,Gavin Barwell, and the Brexit minister Steve Baker, several MPs said they were alarmed by the earlier leaked statements. Theresa Villiers, the Brexit-backing former Northern Ireland secretary, asked the question up front, if alignment was a possibility, but sources said the reply was non-committal. The influential Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said that Tory MPs would not allow the regulation even of Northern Ireland to be aligned with the EU. \u201cWe cannot align the regulation of one part of the United Kingdom with the European Union. If we align the whole of the United Kingdom then we haven\u2019t left the European Union so there is a logical impossibility of doing what the Irish government proposes,\u201d he told reporters outside the meeting of backbench Conservative MPs. Rees-Mogg said the DUP and the Conservative party were in total agreement. He said: Gavin Barwell made it absolutely clear. As he said, we are not going to trade on distinctions between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That would be completely intolerable. We are the Conservative and Unionist party after all. Asked if MPs had been told that different regulatory systems were possible, Rees-Mogg said: I don\u2019t think that could possibly happen, the government doesn\u2019t have a majority. The suggestions so far are coming from the Irish government. The Irish government leaked a document which isn\u2019t the case, as far as I can tell. It has caused everybody to be concerned. It was reported as if it was true, and now it turns out it was propaganda from the Irish government. Former minister Anna Soubry said the simple solution would be for the UK to stay in the single market and the customs union. She said: Nobody could want one part of our country to have a different set of rules to another part of the country. On that, Jacob and I are absolutely agreed. The sense in the room is that nobody wanted that. If we stay in the single market, that solves the problem. Leave Means Leave, the successor organisation to Leave.EU, says Theresa May should not agree a deal that involves treating Northern Ireland separately to the rest of the UK. A spokesman said: Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and it must therefore leave the EU on exactly the same terms. Reports to the contrary are deeply concerning. We welcome confirmation from the prime minister, at the earliest opportunity, that she will completely rule out any proposal to treat Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the United Kingdom. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said that allowing Northern Ireland to become the only part of the UK with special access to the single market would undermine the Scottish economy, and underlined the case for Scottish independence. Northern Ireland\u2019s economy is substantially weaker than Scotland\u2019s but Sturgeon said in a lengthy statement that an open borders deal with Ireland would put Scotland \u201cat a double disadvantage\u201d on jobs and investment, by boosting Northern Ireland\u2019s trade and business links at the expense of other parts of the UK. Sturgeon insisted an Irish deal made all the UK government\u2019s arguments against the same for Scotland redundant. \u201cIndeed, if Northern Ireland is effectively kept in the single market it makes it all the more vital for Scotland\u2019s national and economic interests that we are too,\u201d she said. Here are more quotes from the Leo Varadkar at the press conference. The Irish negotiating team received confirmation from the British goverment and the Barnier taskforce that the United Kingdom had agreed a text on the border that met our concerns. This text would form a part of the broader EU/UK agreement on phase one (of the Brexit negotiations) and allow us all to move on to phase two. I am surprised and disappointed that the British government now appears not to be in a position to conclude what was agreed earlier today. I accept that the prime minister has asked for more time, and I know that she faces many challenges and I acknowledge that she is negotiating in good faith. But my position and that of the Irish government is unequivocal and is supported by all the parties in Dail Eirann and I believe the majority of people on these islands. Ireland wants to proceed to phase two - It\u2019s very much in our interests to do so. However we cannot agree to do this unless we have firm guarantees that there will not be a hard border in Ireland under any circumstances. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, has said he is \u201cdisappointed and surprised\u201d that the agreement reached between Ireland and Britain this morning was no longer acceptable to Theresa May. He refused to \u201cascribe blame\u201d on the Democratic Unionist party for scuppering today\u2019s announcement and said he was \u201chappy\u201d to give the prime minister more time to get domestic support for the proposal which was agreed just before May sat down to lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be helpful for me to ascribe any blame. It is evident that things broke down, became problematic during the lunch in Brussels,\u201d Varadkar told reporters. His deputy foreign minister had gone on national radio just after 1pm to announce that a deal was close with \u201ca positive statement for the country\u201d from the taoiseach planned for the afternoon. But the deal started to go sour just before a 2.30pm press conference at government buildings, when in a hastily arranged press briefing the DUP made it clear it would not tolerate any deal that separated it from the United Kingdom with party leader Arlene Foster accusing Varadkar of trying to stitch up a deal unilaterally. Varakdar said he believed this was a hitch and everything could still be salvaged. \u201cWe believe it [the agreement] stands and we believe the prime minister needs a bit more time and we are happy to allow here more time if that is what is needed, there is plenty of time between now and 14 December,\u201d he said. \u201cThe text was agreed this morning, we haven\u2019t received any requests of changes to that,\u201d said Varadkar. We were happy to accept, convergence, no divergence or regulatory alignment, all those things essentially mean the same thing. If we can\u2019t reach an agreement by 14 December then we can\u2019t move on to phase two of negotiations. But Ireland wants to move on to phase two, we want to talk about the transition period, because that\u2019s what people need to make plan. Some of the questions regarding the DUP that were being bowled to Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar are perplexing. One in particular asked if the \u2018hard men\u2019 of the DUP had leaned on Arlene Foster and forced her hand to reject the EU-Irish backed deal for Northern Ireland. (See 5.33pm.) This questioning seriously misunderstands the nature of the DUP and its politics. Only a fortnight ago, Foster told her party conference the DUP would not back any plan from Brussels that might, in her mind, \u201cdecouple\u201d Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. What is clear this evening is that the DUP in unison, and their old rival Lord Trimble (once the leader of the Ulster Unionists, now a Tory peer) regarded the deal as \u201cminted\u201d in Dublin exclusively. There is no evidence of any divergence of opinion on the matter from within the DUP. They are united as are all strands of unionism tonight in opposition to the proposal. The Varadkar press conference is over. And here is the key lines. Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, accused Theresa May of approving a Brexit deal which she could not subsequently deliver. He strongly implied that the DUP was to blame for the setback, although he did not say that directly. The Express\u2019s Nick Gutteridge has tweeted one of the best quotes. He said that he trusted May and thought she was negotiating in good faith. He said he thought there was still time to negotiate a deal. He said that, as far as his government was concerned, promising \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d between Northern Ireland and the EU, and no regulatory divergence, amounted to the same thing. Q: Do you plan any talks with May on this? Varadkar says he does not see any reason to change the text that was agreed. Of course there will be ongoing contacts, he says. Q: Would you be happy to see the text you agreed today changed? Varadkar says the text was agreed this morning. He has not received any requests for changes that would change the meaning. He says his government was happy with \u201cconvergence\u201d, \u201cno divergence\u201d or \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d. He says Ireland wants to get on to the trade talks. It wants to sort out issues like aviation and security. He repeats the point about being \u201cdisappointed and surprised\u201d that the deal agreed this morning was rejected. Q: Do you see this as a DUP problem, or a problem in the Conservative party? Varadkar says it is not for him to comment on what is happening in other parties. He was \u201cdisappointed\u201d there was no deal today, he says. But he is happy to allow the UK more time. Q: What were you told about why the deal broke down? Varadkar says it would not be helpful for him to ascribe blame. But it became evident during May\u2019s lunch with Juncker that the deal was breaking down. It would not be helpful for him to blame anyone, he says. Q: Do you think Arlene Foster had agreed to this wording, only for the \u201chard men\u201d to lean on her and make her change her mind? Varadkar says other parties can speak for themselves. He says a majority of people in Northern Ireland voted remain. And a majority support the Good Friday agreement, which allows special treatment for Northern Ireland. This is from 3NewsIreland\u2019s Gavan Reilly. Q: Did you believe the DUP were on side for a deal? Varadkar says it was never his job to square the deal. He negotiated with the EU and London. He thought there was a deal. He says he does believe May is negotiating in good faith. He trusts her. He thinks there is time to agree a deal. Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister, intervenes. He says these are structured negotiations. That is where the language came from. It did not come from talks with political parties on the phone. So the deal had been done, he says. Since then, there has been a request for more time. Varadkar is now taking questions. Q: Is there any difference between avoiding regulatory divergence and maintaing regulatory alignmement? Varadkar says, as far as his government is concerned, they mean the same thing. Q: Are the DUP blocking this? Varadkar says it is up to May who she negotiates with. He says that his government listens to the DUP. But it listens to other people too. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, is speaking now. He says the border issue has been the most difficult. This is not a new problem, he says. He says it has always been crucial. He says the Irish government has no hidden agenda. It just wants to protect the Good Friday agreement. This morning, the Irish government was told the British government would agree a text acceptable to Ireland. He told Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk he backed the wording. But then he found out that that was unacceptable to Theresa May. He says he accepts May is acting in good faith. He says Ireland remains opposed to anything that would lead to a hard border. He says he has spoken to Juncker, who said the Ireland\u2019s position was the EU\u2019s position. In a BBC interview earlier, the DUP MP Sammy Wilson said that the language on regulatory divergence leaked to RTE this morning (see 11.44am) was language that the DUP had already rejected. He claimed the Irish government were trying to bounce London into the kind of deal they wanted. He also implied that any deal proposing \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d would be unacceptable to the DUP. He said: Regulatory alignment or regulatory convergence are simply EU-speak for keeping Northern Ireland within the bounds of the single market. As regulations change in the single market, we would have to change our regulations. So in effect part of the United Kingdom would be kept within the single market. And that would be devastating; leave aside the constitutional issue, that would be bad for Northern Ireland, given that our main market is not the Irish Republic. It is not even the whole of the EU. Our main market is the UK, and the integrity of the single UK market is far more important to us, to people who work in Northern Ireland, to firms that operate in Northern Ireland, than having some kind of regulatory convergence or continuance with the rest of Europe. He criticised the government\u2019s negotiating stance generally. Pointing out that London has already made concessions on the \u201cBrexit bill\u201d, he said: And don\u2019t forget, this is all before we have got one scrap of concession from the EU on a free trade arrangement. This is mad negotiating. In the Commons, a Labour MP, Peter Kyle, used a point of order to ask about the Brexit talks. He said This is a shambles that puts into perspective the constitutional settlement for our country here. Can we expect her [Theresa May] to make a statement tomorrow? John Bercow, the Speaker, said he had been told May would be making a statement to the Commons about the deal this week and had expected it tomorrow. (Now it will probably come later, once the deal has been finalised.) My colleague Jessica Elgot was doorstepping the meeting where Gavin Barwell, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, and Steve Baker, the Brexit minister, were briefing MPs on the UK-EU deal - what might have been the deal. The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and tanaiste (his deputy) are to make a statement at 5.15pm, almost three hours before they had expected to make \u201ca positive statement to the country\u201d. This is from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming. This, from the Financial Times\u2019s Jim Pickard, provides some useful perspective on today\u2019s events. It is worth pointing out too it won\u2019t do Theresa May any harm either with her supporters to be seen to be holding up an agreement. But feigned intransigence only works if it is plausible. Jean-Claude Juncker may have been laying it on just a little too thickly when he lauded Theresa May as a tough negotiator. (See 4.16pm.) For an alternative view as to how the government has handled the negotiation, this is what the former head of the Treasury, Nick Macpherson, tweeted last week, on the day it emerged that the UK would be paying around \u20ac50bn for the \u201cBrexit bill\u201d. It is being said the DUP scuppered today\u2019s deal. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. And this is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. And here is the full text of what Jean-Claude Juncker said. We had a friendly and constructive meeting today. It\u2019s always a pleasure to meet Prime Minister May because our present relations is one of the most excellent which exists for the European Union. But I have to say that she is a tough negotiator, and not an easy one. She\u2019s defending the point of view of Britain with all the energy we know she has. And I\u2019m doing the same on the side of the European Union. Despite all our best efforts and the significant progress we and our teams have made over the past days on the remaining withdrawal issues, it was not possible to reach a complete agreement today. We now have a common understanding on most relative issues \u2013 with just two or three open for discussion which require further consultation, further negotiation and further discussion. We stand ready to resume the negotiations with the United Kingdom here in Brussels later this week. But I have to say that we were narrowing our positions to a huge extent extent today thanks to the British prime minister and thanks to the willingness of the European Commission to have a fair deal with Britain. I\u2019m still confident that we can reach sufficient progress before the European council on 15 December. This is not a failure, this is the start of the very last round. I am very confident that we will reach agreement in the course of this week. Here is the BBC\u2019s Katya Adler on the May/Juncker statements. The pound fell in response to the news that there won\u2019t be a deal today, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Georgi Kantchev reports. Here are Theresa May\u2019s words in full. She said: As President Juncker has said, we have had a constructive meeting today. Both sides have been working hard in good faith. We\u2019ve been negotiating hard, and a lot of progress has been made. On many of the issues there is a common understanding. And it is clear, crucially, that we want to move forward together. But on a couple of issues some differences do remain which require further negotiation and consultation and those will continue. But we will reconvene before the end of the week and I am also confident that we will conclude this positively. Theresa May is speaking now. May confirms that there is no deal today. She says there are two main issues outstanding. She says she expects to return to Brussels later this week. Jean-Claude Juncker says he had a friendly and constructive meeting with Theresa May. I have to say, she\u2019s a tough negotiator, not an easy one. May is defending the UK with all the energy she has, he says. He says despite their best efforts, \u201cit was not possible to reach a complete agreement today.\u201d Juncker says he and May have not reached an agreement today. He says just two or three issues are still undecided. He says he is still \u201cconfident\u201d there will be an agreement before the EU summit next week. This is from the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, Kaya Adler. Denis MacShane, the former Labour Europe minister, thinks that, in practice, the wording of the UK-EU deal would mean Northern Ireland staying in the single market and the customs union (despite what Rupert Harrison says - see 2.39pm). This is from Sky\u2019s Mark Stone. This is from Politico Europe\u2019s Tom McTague. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, wants a slice of the Northern Ireland deal, too. Like Nicola Sturgeon (see 1.47pm) and Sadiq Khan (see 2.56pm), he is saying that if Northern Ireland gets a deal on regulatory alignment, Wales should get one. He posted this on Twitter. Scotland and London are alike in both being pro-remain. (Scotland was 62% remain, and London 60% remain.) Wales voted 52.5% for leave although Jones, like Khan, is a Labour politician. So we know have Scotland, Wales and London all asking for what has been offered to Northern Ireland. (The alliance may revive the - only semi-frivolous - suggestion that the best solution for Brexit would be for England to leave the EU and the UK, leaving the rest of the UK, \u201crUK\u201d, in the single market and the customs union.) The Democratic Unionists believe that the early morning hype about an imminent deal between London and Dublin was \u201cmanufactured\u201d by the Irish government. Arlene Foster\u2019s insistence that this Brexit arrangement \u201cseparates\u201d Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK poses a major headache for Theresa May after she comes out of her lunch with EU leaders in Brussels. DUP sources said they did not believe the draft posted by RTE earlier (see 11.44am) had been agreed by the British government. They said they suspected that the leak of the draft document was designed to \u201cbounce\u201d May and the British negotiators into a deal over the heads of the DUP. The DUP are also confident that they have support among the Tory back benches to oppose any move by May and the government to accept this Brexit-Irish border blueprint, the sources said. The party will block any moves akin to the leaked document from this morning, the DUP sources insisted. They said the party would fight any move to switch the border into the Irish Sea and effectively \u201cdecouple\u201d Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. This is from Sky\u2019s Ireland correspondent, David Blevins. The Sunday Times\u2019 Bojan Pancevski thinks commentators have overstated the extent to which London has conceded to Dublin and that in fact this UK-EU deal is a classic Brussels compromise. Pancevski is referring to comments like this one, from the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney, explicitly saying there must be no \u201cregulatory divergence\u201d. Coveney told the Today programme: The area that we have focused in on is the need to give reassurance that there will not be regulatory divergence between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. Because if there is, then it is very hard to avoid a checking system. If you have different standards in terms of food safety, animal welfare, animal health, if you have different standards in relation medical devices and the approval of drugs and so on, how then can you maintain practical north/south cooperation as we have it today if that regulatory divergence appears after Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. This is from Peter Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is following events from India, where he is on a visit. Like Nicola Sturgeon (see 1.47pm), he is arguing that if Northern Ireland can get a deal that keeps it aligned to EU regulation, London should get one, too. (Of course, as Rupert Harrison argues [see 2.39pm], regulatory alignment is not necessarily the same as staying in the single market. But it could be, and it may feel similar.) This is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn. This is from INM\u2019s Kevin Doyle. The BBC says No 10 sources are now cautious about the prospect of a deal being agreed today. (Earlier David Davis, the Brexit secretary, said he hoped it would all get wrapped up today. See 11.09am.) That might help to explain why Leo Varadkar has postponed his statement. Rupert Harrison, who was George Osborne\u2019s chief of staff when he was chancellor, has taken to Twitter to say that \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d is not the same as Northern Ireland staying in the single market. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, seized on the apparent deal [to keep Northern Ireland closely aligned to EU customs union and single market rules] as proof that her demands for a special deal for Scotland were realistic. She tweeted: Her reaction underlines the Scottish government\u2019s frustration that its requests to keep Scotland inside the single market, a stance backed by a majority of parties at Holyrood, has been dismissed as unworkable by UK ministers. Sturgeon is closely watching developments with May\u2019s talks on Monday in Brussels, her officials said, and she or her Brexit minister, Mike Russell, are likely to respond officially to the deal over the Irish border once there is confirmation about its terms. Scotland voted heavily to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, yet is being taken out along with the rest of the UK, on terms negotiated by a Tory party with no direct mandate in Scotland. Sturgeon has sought repeatedly to tie Brexit with her quest for Scottish independence from the UK, and she flagged that link again in a further tweet that applauded Ireland\u2019s favourable deal on its border with Northern Ireland. In a post on his Facebook page, ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston says Theresa May is \u201ctaking the risk of her political life\u201d. (He\u2019s forgotten about about the election, obviously.) He writes: Now it is with that very last concession that the PM is taking the political risk of her life, because in that concession she is in effect saying that a trade deal for the whole UK will also be based on a promise of close regulatory alignment between our country and the EU, in perpetuity. That permanent regulatory convergence between the UK and EU is her preferred route, because without it her government would collapse: Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP MPs, which are sustaining the Tories in office, have made it crystal clear that they will not accept a separate regulatory set-up for Northern Ireland from that prevailing in the UK as a whole. But here is what I assume will be scaring the PM witless (it scares me, just as a bystander). She is signing up for close regulatory alignment between the UK and EU without ever having secured agreement for that from the cabinet. And for Johnson, Gove and most of the other more ardent Brexiteers, in and out of the Cabinet, almost the whole point of leaving the EU was for the UK to \u201ctake back control\u201d of setting rules and regulations for British businesses. Peston also thinks there is a risk this could result in the UK leaving the EU with no deal, and a hard border going up in Ireland. If her own cabinet and backbench colleagues end up vetoing that offer, even if it is accepted by Juncker at today\u2019s lunch, that would see the UK having no trade deal with the EU and being forced to reintroduce a peace-disrupting hard border with the Republic. But if the Irish Times is right, Peston is wrong on this last point. The Irish Times\u2019s Fiach Kelly says their understanding is that the \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d promise covers a no deal Brexit too. Their story is here. My colleague Henry McDonald describes Arlene Foster\u2019s statement (see 2.14pm) as amounting to her throwing \u201ca dose of cold water on the heated speculation over a proposed agreement\u201d. Here is Arlene Foster\u2019s statement in full. She did not take questions. We have been very clear: Northern Ireland must leave the European Union on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom and we will not accept any form of regulatory divergence which separate Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the UK. And the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom must not be compromised in any way. And Her Majesty\u2019s government understands the position of this party. The prime minister has told the House of Commons that there will be no border in the Irish Sea. And the prime minister has been clear that the UK is leaving the European Union as a whole, that the territorial and economic integrity of the United Kingdom will be protected. For our part, of course, we do want to see a sensible Brexit, a Brexit where the common travel area is continued, where we meet our financial obligations, where we have a strict, time-limited implementation period, and where the contribution of EU migrants to our economy is recognised in a practical manner. The Republic of Ireland government for their part claim to be guarantors of the Belfast agreement but they are clearly seeking to unilaterally change that Belfast agreement without out input or our consent. And of course we will not stand for that. And here are the main points. Foster, the DUP leader, did not explicitly condemn the UK-EU border deal. She expressed reservations about it, but did not firmly condemn it. She said the DUP would not accept any \u201cregulatory divergence\u201d between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. This is awkward for Theresa May, because it implies the DUP want the \u2018regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit\u2019 condition to apply to the whole of the UK - something which is unacceptable to Tory Brexiters. She accused the Irish government of trying to undermine the Good Friday agreement. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, is speaking now. She says the DUP would oppose anything that would lead to regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. She says the DUP wants to see a sensible Brexit. The Irish government claim to be guarantors of the Belfast agreement. But they are seeking to unilaterally change it, she says. She says the DUP will not stand for that. This, from the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner, is helpful. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has posted this on Twitter about the UK-EU deal. (Farage\u2019s critics would doubtless argue that, if he was worried about the integrity of the UK, he should have not have been campaigning for Brexit in the first place.) Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, will be speaking to journalists shortly. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, says if Northern Ireland is allowed to maintain regulatory alignment with the EU, Scotland should be get this status too. We now seem to be in an odd position where Northern Ireland is getting a post-Brexit guarantee its lead political party does not want (see 1.13pm), while Scotland is being denied the same guarantee even thought its lead political party is in favour. Experts in Belfast say the reported deal raises difficult questions about government in Northern Ireland. \u201cHow do you define regulatory alignment? Who is going to oversee it? What kind of dispute resolution mechanism is there? Is this going to be the responsibility of the devolved government and, if there isn\u2019t an assembly, is it the responsibility of London and Dublin?,\u201d asked David Phinnemore, professor of European policy at Queen\u2019s University. Unlike countries in the European Economic Area, which automatically adopt European law, regulatory alignment suggested that a decision would have to be taken in the UK to make sure that parallel adoption of laws, he added. Phinnemore said it was important to see the other wording in the 15-page document relating to non-trade issues and the 142 areas on North-South co-operation identified by Britain and the EU as being impacted by Brexit. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, said this morning that the UK and Irish governments would find a way to push ahead at this stage, saying a \u201cfudge is doable this month with a bit of goodwill\u201d. That could include wording around regulatory convergence that would be enough not to annoy the DUP. However, in the longer term he suggested there would still be key sticking points that would prevent frictionless trade and an invisible border. \u201cIn the long run unless Northern Ireland stays in the EU\u2019s customs union there will have to be border controls of some sort between north and south. Even if it does stay in the customs union, the need to police the single market may also require some controls,\u201d Grant told the Guardian. If the decision was taken for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union, that would impact on future free trade agreements with third countries, such as the US, which would not apply in northern Ireland. \u201cIn economic terms there would be quasi union of north and south,\u201d he added - arguing that such an outcome could be difficult for the DUP to stomach. However, Grant questioned if there could be an agricultural union under which the north and republic had a special deal relating to one sector, but not a full customs arrangement. That would diminish but not eliminate the need for border checks, he argued. This is what Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, told RTE a few minutes ago. We hope to be in place in just over an hour\u2019s time that the Taoiseach will be able to make a positive statement to the country. Certainly the indications we have is that we are in a much better place than we have been in Brexit negotiations to date. We have now a language that gives us the safeguards we need; that there is reassurance for people there is not going to be a re-emergence of a border. Irish concerns are going to be addressed fully. He also said he hoped the wording of the final agreement would be agreed \u201cin the next hour\u201d. Asked about the opposition from the Democratic Unionist party, Coveney refused to be drawn. He said: The relationship between the British government and the DUP is a matter for the British government and the DUP we have a responsibility to listen to the DUP and we have listened to the DUP but we have listened to others too. Here is another quote from the DUP hardliner and party Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson. He told the Press Association: I think that this is emanating from the Irish government, obviously, trying to push the UK government into a corner in the negotiations. It is not well thought through. I don\u2019t think, given its promises, the British government could concede on this. David Trimble, the former Ulster Unionist leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement and who is now a Conservative peer, has told the BBC that the deal on regulatory alignment sounds like \u201ca thoroughly bad idea\u201d. This is from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll. The Irish deputy PM is Simon Coveney. Democratic Unionist party sources described the latest proposal from Brussels on Brexit and the Irish border as \u2018only a draft document\u2019 which they stressed the British government has not accepted. One senior DUP source described the document as an \u2018Irish government inspired\u2019 leak. Although the party hierarchy are holding back from issuing a formal statement this lunchtime, at least about the draft, their outspoken East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said that, if what was being reported about what was in the agreement turned out to be true, that would be unacceptable. He said: The government have made it very clear and even today again, that there will no agreement made which would impact and create differences, not just on a constitutional basis but on an economic basis, that would make a difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. We will do nothing that would separate us from our main market which is the UK. Wilson stressed he and the other nine DUP MPs \u201chad the leverage\u201d in parliament to hold the government to the agreement his party secured with the Tories after the June general election, which keeps Theresa May in 10 Downing Street. According to Jack Maidment, Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP\u2019s chief whip at Westminster, thinks the UK has not signed up to full regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU after Brexit. We have not seen the text yet, but the draft seen by RTE said the UK was agreeing to non-divergence, or alignment, only in so far as that was necessary to \u201csupport North South cooperation and the protection of the Good Friday agreement\u201d. (See 11.44am.) It does sound as if the spin that London will be putting on this agreement when the government explains it to the DUP will be rather different from the interpretation being put on it in Dublin. It is understood Ireland sees the phrase \u2018regulatory alignment\u2019 as providing the highest degree of comfort to both sides allowing talks to be bounced to the next phase while at the same time giving room for manoeuvre for negotiations in the second phase. According to sources, alternative terms considered were regulatory convergence and regulatory equivalence, a condition banks have been seeking post Brexit to allow them continue to sell into the single market. Brian Lucey, professor of finance at the school of business, Trinity College Dublin, said: I think alignment is the more ambiguous form of words that give wriggle room. There will always be subtle divergence between two jurisdictions and it is always up to two national governments to decide what they are. For instance Ireland and Northern Ireland have different duties and VAT levels even though both are currently in the EU. \u201cThe big question is that regulatory alignment has to imply a regulatory or customs barrier in the Irish sea unless the UK aligns itself too,\u201d said Lucey. This will not be acceptable to Brexiteers or the Democratic Unionist Party which has said this is tantamount to the break up of the United Kingdom. Who knew Donald Tusk, president of the European council, was a Boomtown Rats fan? The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg thinks it may be too late for Theresa May to refuse a deal now. Ireland\u2019s taoiseach Leo Varadkar has called a special meeting of all party leaders to update them on Brexit at lunchtime and will be making a statement at 2.30pm. The government has not confirmed a deal has been sealed but sources are not denying reports from Brussels that agreement has been reached. Deputy prime minister Simon Coveney is also expected to make a statement this afternoon. One theory as to why the DUP has been hardening its line on Brexit in recent months is that it is under pressure from Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), a breakaway party set up in 2007 Jim Allister, a DUP MEP angry at the party\u2019s decision to share power with Sinn Fein. As Sky\u2019s David Blevins reports, Allister has described \u201cno regulatory convergence\u201d as \u201ca stepping stone to a United Ireland\u201d. The TUV vote in elections in Northern Ireland is minuscule, but it probably exerts more influence on DUP thinking than the raw numbers suggest. The DUP MP Sammy Wilson is opposed to committing Northern Ireland to regulatory alignment with the Republic, according to the Detail\u2019s Steven McCaffery. Theresa May has arrived in Brussels for her lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker. According to Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam, the language in the draft text of the agreement seems to have switched from talking about avoiding regulatory divergence between the Republic and Northern Ireland (see 11.44am) to maintaining regulatory alignment. This would bring it into line with the language proposed by the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group (BSG) in their open letter to Michel Barnier last week. They said: Concerning Ireland, the BSG believes that the UK must make a clear commitment, to be enshrined in a form which would guarantee its full implementation in the withdrawal agreement, that it would protect the operation of the Good Friday agreement in all its parts, ensure, by means of continued regulatory alignment between the North and the South, there is no hardening of the border on the island of Ireland and that there is no diminishing of the rights of people in Northern Ireland. And this is from the Times\u2019 Sam Coates. (There is still time for the Commons speaker to agree an urgent question.) It looks as if Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, is expecting a deal today. He has just tweeted these. And this is from the Irish Times\u2019 Fiach Kelly. Here is the Irish journalist Peter Geoghegan on the UK\u2019s concession on the Irish border. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Peter Foster. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is cheering Ireland on from the sidelines. At the regular morning Number 10 lobby briefing Theresa May\u2019s official spokesman insisted there will be no difference in the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. \u201cThe PM has been clear that the UK is leaving the EU as a whole, and the territorial and economic integrity of the UK will be protected,\u201d he said, refusing to elaborate further on what that means. He would not comment on the RTE story reporting that the UK would commit to no regulatory divergence on the island of Ireland (see 11.44am), but sought to undermine the broadcaster\u2019s credibility, saying: \u201cRTE was reporting this morning that we were holding a cabinet meeting and I missed that if it occurred.\u201d Here is some more on the deal. This is from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam. https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/937645701177192448 The British have conceded on the Irish border, a senior MEP has said following a meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. Philippe Lamberts, the leader of the Green group in the European parliament, was speaking after the meeting, where leading MEPs were shown a 15-page joint statement reflecting what has been agreed. Paragraph 10 says the UK will commit to regulatory alignment between the Republic and Northern Ireland whatever happens in future trade talks. \u201cI was surprised they agreed,\u201d said Lamberts. This is from RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly. Here is the RTE story in full. And here is an extract. The UK has conceded to EU negotiators that there will be no divergence of the rules covering the EU single market and customs union on the island of Ireland post Brexit, according to a draft negotiating text seen by RT\u00c9 News. The concession, if accepted by the Irish Government, would have far reaching implications for how closely Northern Ireland remains bound to EU structures. But it remains an open question if the final text will be agreeable to both the Irish and British governments. And the story includes this quote from the draft negotiating text. In the absence of agreed solutions the UK will ensure that there continues to be no divergence from those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North South cooperation and the protection of the Good Friday agreement. The Irish government has been repeatedly demanding an assurance from the UK that after Brexit there will be no regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the EU. That would enable the authorities on both sides to keep the border soft. In an interview on Friday Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, said it was important that the \u201cno divergence\u201d pledge applied not just to agriculture but to areas such as health too. He said: If you have different standards in terms of food safety, animal welfare, animal health,\u201d he said, \u201cif you have different standards in relation to medical devices and the approval of drugs and so on, how then can you maintain practical north-south cooperation as we have it today if that regulatory divergence appears after Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom leaves the European Union? It is not clear whether \u201cno divergence from those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North South cooperation and the protection of the Good Friday agreement\u201d, the words in the draft text, is the same as no divergence generally. Presumably the UK government will argue there is a difference. Because if the UK were to accept no regulatory divergence at all between Northern Ireland and the EU after Brexit, and given what it has said about maintaining the integrity of the UK, it would effectively be conceding that the UK will maintain regulatory equivalence with the EU after Brexit - something totally unacceptable to hardcore Brexiters. Here is a picture of Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, meeting Guy Verhofstadt and other MEPs from the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group this morning. According to Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam, Verhofstadt said the chances of a deal were \u201c50/50\u201d. Afterwards Verhofstadt said MEPs were particularly concerned to ensure that the process for EU nationals who want to stay in the UK after Brexit isn\u2019t burdensome. Donald Tusk, the European council president, has cancelled a trip to the Middle East in the middle of the week so he can be around for more Brexit talks. As the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports, that does not necessarily tell us much at all. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has said that he hopes the EU will agree today that that trade talks can start after December. In a clip for broadcasters before he boarded the plane for Brussels, he said: We\u2019ve put seven months of work, both sides, into getting to this point and we are hoping that Mr Juncker today will give us sufficient progress so that we can move on to the trade talks. The decision, of course, won\u2019t be taken until 15 December but that\u2019s what we are hoping for, because trade talks are of enormous importance to the United Kingdom and to Europe. Davis sounds a bit more upbeat that Number 10 did last night, when it issued this statement implying that talks could drag on a little longer. The one-sentence quote from a spokesman said: With plenty of discussions still to go, Monday will be an important staging post on the road to the crucial December council. Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, also told RTE this morning that Ireland\u2019s concerns about the border are shared by the Commons Brexit committee. Coveney is right. Here is the committee\u2019s report. And this is what it said about the UK\u2019s proposals for Ireland/Northern Ireland border. We welcome the government\u2019s commitment to \u201cno physical infrastructure\u201d at the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. We also welcome its rejection of a customs border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We do not currently see how it will be possible to reconcile there being no border with the government\u2019s policy of leaving the single market and the customs union, which will inevitably make the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland the EU\u2019s customs border with the UK; i.e. including the land border in Northern Ireland and at the ports of Holyhead, Milford Haven and Fishguard that provide freight services to and from the Republic of Ireland. It will be made harder by the fact that the government\u2019s proposals, by its own admission, are untested and to some extent speculative. We call upon the government to set out in more detail how a \u201cfrictionless\u201d border can in practice be maintained with the UK outside the single market and the customs union. Yesterday Conservative Brexiters started issuing a new clutch of \u201cred lines\u201d for Theresa May ahead of today\u2019s talks. Leave Means Leave published an open letter to May with seven demands, and Iain Duncan Smith wrote an article for the Sunday Telegraph making similar arguments. Does this amount to a serious threat to the prime minister if she makes too many compromises? Or are the Brexiters just sounding belligerent in the hope of somehow boosting May\u2019s position in the talks? (The theory being that, by sounding off in the Telegraph, they enable her to to Brussels saying, \u2018You must give me what I want because otherwise my backbenchers will go beserk.\u2019) It is hard to be sure quite what their motives are, but on the Today programme this morning Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary and one of the signatories of the Leave Means Leave letter, implied that he was more interested in helping May than constraining her. He said that he was \u201cemphatically behind the prime minister\u201d and, when asked if he would vote against the government if it breached the Leave Means Leave \u201cred lines\u201d, he replied: No, no, no, no. What we\u2019re talking about is making it very clear to those with whom she will be meeting today for lunch and negotiating with next week that they have been dragging their feet on the issue of the end economic relationship. In his interview Paterson also insisted that the Irish border could remain \u201csoft\u201d by ensuring customs checks are done at the point of shipment, while technology tracks goods crossing the frontier. He told the programme: The fact is we have incredibly close relations with the Republic of Ireland, this trade is generally small, as I have just said it\u2019s regular, and it can be handled with modern communication techniques, electronic invoicing etc. As RTE\u2019s Tony Connolly reports, Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, subsequently said Paterson was wrong about the volume of north/south trade being small. Here is David Davis, the Brexit secretary, leaving his office this morning for his trip to Brussels. He is accompanying the prime minister. Here is the Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar arriving at government buildings in Dublin before this morning\u2019s Irish government cabinet meeting. (I presume he changed before it started.) Faisal Islam, Sky\u2019s political editor, is also picking up negative vibes from Brussels. This is a reference to the Manfred Weber tweets I posted earlier. See 9.19am. Donald Tusk, the European council president, is meeting Theresa May at 4pm Brussels time (3pm UK time), AFP\u2019s Danny Kemp reports. The Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar has tweeted about the special Irish government cabinet meeting. The BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg is picking up a sense that we might not get a Brexit deal today after all. Turning away from Brexit for a moment, Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, was on LBC this morning talking about Neil Lewis, the former Met officer who gave an interview to the BBC last week talking about the (legal) pornography found on Damian Green\u2019s Commons computer during a police raid in 2009. Dick said Lewis was wrong to reveal confidential information of this kind. She told LBC: Police officers have a duty of confidentiality. We come into contact with personal information very regularly, sometimes extremely sensitive. This is a daily occurrence for any officer. We all know that we have a duty to protect that information and to keep it confidential. In my view, that duty endures. It endures after you leave the service, so I believe that what this officer and, indeed, other retired officers, appears to have done is wrong and my professional standards department will be reviewing what has happened in relation to how information has been handled and if any offences are disclosed, we will investigate them. Asked if it was possible Lewis could be prosecuted, she replied: Undoubtedly, if offences have been disclosed and that can be proved, it would be a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service, but there could be a prosecution. I\u2019ve said before I don\u2019t want to give a running commentary on this matter. It\u2019s clearly sensitive, it\u2019s controversial and there is a Cabinet Office inquiry running in parallel, as you know, but today I think it is appropriate that I say that what they appear to have done seems to me to be quite wrong. Helen McEntee, Ireland\u2019s Europe minister, told the Today programme this morning that progress has been made on the Irish border issue over the weekend but that the Irish government still does not have a final text it can approve, my colleagues Peter Walker and Lisa O\u2019Carroll report. Asked if she thought Ireland and the UK were close to a breakthrough, McEntee told Today: No, I do not believe we are. However, I do think that we have made quite a lot of work, or progress, over the weekend. It is absolutely impossible for us to allow the negotiations to move on to phase two when we don\u2019t have an absolute, concrete commitment from the UK government that we will not have a hard border on the island of Ireland. I do believe that we are nearing closer progress, and the sufficient progress. We are not there yet, and that is why we are meeting as a cabinet this morning to look at where we are - to assess exactly where we are, to look at what has been presented, and to see what we need to do to move forward. If there is not enough that has been given to us in written form ... it is up to the UK government to produce that, to provide that. And, obviously, as a government we will assess it. I think we all want to hope that we can move on to phase two as quickly as possible, and particularly in time for December council on the 14th of December. Are you fed up of reading about the interminable Brexit talks? If so, some partial good news. Today could be the day when phase one finally concludes. Theresa May is going to Brussels for a key lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, and both sides want to reach an agreement on the three issues on the table in phase one - citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border - that will qualify as \u201csufficient progress\u201d and trigger a move to phase two. You may have assumed that the deadline for a decision was the December EU summit starting on Thursday next week. That is where EU leaders are due to take the final decision about moving the Brexit talks to phase two, where the UK and the EU will discuss a transition deal and the future trade relationship. But Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, and the European commission will have to take a decision this week about whether the \u201csufficient progress\u201d criteria have been met and so in practice today, or at least early this week, has become the deadline for the UK to finalise what its offer is on the three phase one issues. The hope is to set out what has been agreed in a statement that will be published. This could come later today, if all goes well, allowing May to make a statement about it in the Commons tomorrow. All sides seem reasonably optimistic that there will be a deal, but by 9am this morning it still had not been bolted down and it is quite possible that there could be a delay. As usual when talks like this are going to the wire, those close to the process start giving out quite contradictory messages - at once talking up the prospects of a deal, and highlighting how it could all go wrong. The key problem is London\u2019s failure (so far) to give Ireland the firm assurance it wants that Brexit will not lead to the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic and in Dublin this morning, where the Irish cabinet is meeting, Simon Coveney, the deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said there was still no deal on this issue. \u201cWe are not quite yet where we want to be, but it is possible to do that [agree] today,\u201d he told RTE\u2019s Morning Ireland. In a Twitter thread last night Katya Adler, the BBC\u2019s Europe editor, said the mood was positive. Here is how the thread starts. And here is how it ends. But this morning Manfred Weber, leader of the centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP) group in the European parliament, has been stressing that some problems remain. The European parliament is not the lead player in this saga, but it is influential, and will have to approve any final Brexit deal. On the subject of which, if May does wrap up phase one of the Brexit talks today, all that means is that the focus then moves on to phase two - which promises to be even more complicated. I\u2019m afraid the interminable Brexit process will go on. But May will at least have achieved something concrete before Christmas. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: The Irish cabinet meets to discuss Brexit, the border issue and what the UK is offering. 9.30am: Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, meets his Norwegian opposite number, Ine Eriksen S\u00f8reide, in London. 10am: Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, meet the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. 12.15pm: May and Juncker meet for lunch. Afternoon: May meets Donald Tusk, the European council president. 3.30pm: MPs begin day four of the EU withdrawal bill\u2019s committee stage debate. They will debate amendments relating to devolution, and the votes will come at 11.30pm or later. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news from Jack Blanchard\u2019s Playbook. Here is the ConservativeHome round-up of today\u2019s political stories. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019 top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter."

"1||Liverpool and Everton handed derby tie in FA Cup third round drawLiverpool and Everton will face each other in the FA Cup next month after the third-round draw was given a derby flavour. The all-Merseyside fixture means the new Everton manager, Sam Allardyce, will visit Anfield for the second time in the space of a month, with the teams set to collide in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon. The sides last met in the competition in the 2012 semi-final, when Liverpool beat their neighbours 2-1 thanks to Andy Carroll\u2019s late Wembley header. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion will also play host to their rivals, having been paired with Crystal Palace at the Amex Stadium. Last Tuesday\u2019s Premier League fixture between the two was marred by crowd trouble. There will also be a north-east derby with Middlesbrough taking on their Championship rivals Sunderland, while Manchester City will welcome Burnley to the Etihad Stadium. Non-league Hereford will welcome the 2016 Premier League champions Leicester City to Edgar Street provided they win their replay against Fleetwood Town. The draw threw up the potential for upsets as West Ham United were handed a trip to the impressive League One side Shrewsbury Town while the Championship leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers will be licking their lips at the prospect of inflicting more pain on the ailing Swansea City at Molineux. Manchester United were given what seems to be a comfortable home draw against the Championship side Derby County while Tottenham Hotspur face League One AFC Wimbledon at Wembley. The holders, Arsenal, will face what could be a testing encounter with Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. The Hereford manager, Peter Beadle, said the prospect of facing Leicester at Edgar Street would give his Southern Premier League side all the motivation they need to see off Fleetwood. Beadle told BBC Sport: \u201cFormer Premier League champions coming to Edgar Street \u2013 we\u2019ve got 90 minutes to get through but if we do, there\u2019s the incentive. We\u2019ve got three league games before that and they are our priority, but then we can relax and enjoy the replay.\u201d The National League side AFC Fylde will head to Bournemouth if they beat Wigan Athletic in a replay. All the ties will take place between 5 and 8 January. FA Cup third round draw Ipswich v Sheffield Utd; Watford v Bristol City; Birmingham v Burton; Liverpool v Everton; Brighton v Crystal Palace; Aston Villa v Woking or Peterborough; Bournemouth v Fylde or Wigan; Coventry v Stoke; Newport v Leeds; Bolton v Huddersfield; Port Vale or Yeovil v Bradford; Nottingham Forest v Arsenal; Brentford v Notts County; QPR v MK Dons; Manchester United v Derby; Forest Green or Exeter v West Brom; Doncaster v Slough Town or Rochdale; Tottenham v AFC Wimbledon; Middlesbrough v Sunderland; Fleetwood or Hereford v Leicester; Blackburn or Crewe v Hull; Cardiff v Mansfield; Manchester City v Burnley; Shrewsbury v West Ham; Wolves v Swansea; Stevenage v Reading; Newcastle v Luton; Millwall v Barnsley; Fulham v Southampton; Wycombe v Preston; Norwich v Chelsea; Gillingham or Carlisle v Sheffield Wednesday (Ties to be played 5-8 January)"
"0||Milo Yiannopoulos speaks, and Australia's respectable racists howl their approvalMidway through his performance in Adelaide last Friday night, the British alt light provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos smirked as he displayed on the big screen an unflattering photo of the feminist writer Clementine Ford, snapped when she was a teenager. The word \u201cUNFUCKABLE\u201d was superimposed over the top. You\u2019d think Yiannopoulos, of all people, would avoid making public assessments of sexual desirability, what with being caught on camera enthusing about intercourse between older men and younger boys, and then scoffing at the Left\u2019s attitudes to this \u201cchild abuse stuff\u201d. Indeed, one shudders at the images Yiannopoulos might have labelled \u201cFUCKABLE\u201d, given his well-publicised opinions on the \u201carbitrary and oppressive idea of consent\u201d (he later claimed to have been taken out of context). On Monday night, at the first of his two Melbourne gigs, he rejigged the gag, using an image of a slightly older Ford. But the joke remained the same. Ford was unattractive. Ford was a pig. She was, he said, a \u201cfat cunt\u201d \u2013 and the crowd whooped its appreciation. Earlier in the evening, as the audience lined up outside the Melbourne Pavilion in Kensington, many attendees had seemed genuinely puzzled by the chants from the anti-racist protesters floating across over a row of riot police. \u201cThey\u2019re calling him a white supremacist,\u201d said an older woman, waiting with her daughter, \u201cbut he\u2019s married to a gay guy.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s Jewish, too, I heard,\u201d the man behind her said. \u201cI mean, how can he be a fascist if he\u2019s Jewish?\u201d It was a remarkable demonstration of how the right\u2019s opposition to identity politics rests on the very ideas being disavowed, with Yiannopoulos\u2019s personal background somehow providing a pre-emptive alibi for anything he might do or say. In the media there had been chatter that the Troll Academy Australian tour was tanking. The attendance on Monday showed otherwise. The Melbourne Pavilion holds 600 people and Yiannopoulos packed it to capacity, despite announcing the location only a few hours before speaking \u2013 and then held a second show the same evening. Many of those listening to him were seemingly unremarkable, suburban folks. Yes, there were bikers and men wearing Make America Great Again caps and one youth with his face painted like Pepe the frog. But obvious members of the alt right were outnumbered by those conspicuous only by their ordinariness, including a surprisingly high proportion of women. There were even a few family groups \u2013 mum, dad and the kids, out for the evening together. As the seats filled, people talked about Gamergate and the US conservative polemicist Ben Shapiro and the various clips they had seen of Milo mocking and belittling assorted enemies. Some had been drawn by curiosity, but many were already diehard fans. In his book Dangerous, Yiannopoulos claims that the rightwing media depends too much on an audience over 60, an argument he repeated in a recent piece for the Australian. Pundits should, he says, be \u201csassy\u201d \u2013 advice that sounded particularly incongruous presented next to the fulminations of the various portly gentlemen who dominate the Oz\u2019s opinion section. Clearly, Yiannopoulos\u2019s \u201csass\u201d \u2013 if that\u2019s the word for it \u2013 attracts a different demographic than, say, the Coalition for Marriage, the Australian Conservatives or any of the other mainstream efforts to stir the so-called \u201cconservative base\u201d. What, precisely, is his message? Last Wednesday, he gave a bizarre interview to the Daily Mail in which he warned that Australians \u201cought to get used to his intentionally provocative dialogue\u201d \u2014 and then declared that, um, he didn\u2019t much like the Opera House. Conservatism might be the new punk rock, but this particular provocation sounded less Sid Vicious and more Kevin McCloud. What next \u2013 a diss about the Harbour Bridge? A smackdown of new Parliament House? A sick burn about the Shrine of Remembrance? Well, no. That last would be off the agenda, since badmouthing the Anzacs might prove genuinely controversial among his base \u2013 and Yiannopoulos doesn\u2019t do real controversy. On the contrary, his act consists of repeating back to white conservatives, in exaggerated form, what they already think. On Monday night he called Muslims rapists and terrorists. He denounced the demographic shifts in Europe as an existential threat \u2013 London was \u201calready gone\u201d, he said. He mocked feminists and explained, to a chorus of approving laughter, that Aboriginal art was \u201ccrap\u201d and \u201creally shit\u201d. Did he believe any of it? Who knows? The Daily Beast recently published an extract from James Ball\u2019s book Post-Truth under the succinct title: \u201cMilo Yiannopoulos Is the Walking Embodiment of Bulls**t\u201d. In it, we learn that Milo once thought that computer games \u201cattract damaged people\u201d and those who played them were \u201closers\u201d. There were, he argued, \u201cfew things \u2026 more embarrassing than grown men getting over-excited about video games\u201d. Shortly thereafter he became a champion of Gamergate, an online mob of men overexcited about video games. In late 2015, Milo launched a university lecture blitz that he daringly called the Dangerous Faggot tour. He retained the title for his manifesto \u2013 but then shed the second word, presumably recognising that, if the epithet caused a pleasant frisson on campus, it embarrassed conservative booksellers and their customers. \u201cThose are my principles,\u201d Groucho Marx once said, \u201cand if you don\u2019t like them ... well I have others.\u201d As he lambasted Ford for her appearance in Melbourne, Yiannopoulos mispronounced \u201cClementine\u2019. He went on to mock Waleed Aly \u2013 essentially for being Muslim \u2013 and managed to mangle his name, too. Fairly obviously, he knew nothing much about either. He had chosen Ford and Aly as local colour for his prepared shtick, a routine that he could have done just about anywhere. In Adelaide, Andrew Bolt had served as the hype man, a role played in Melbourne by Ross Cameron. A few days after the Adelaide event, Bolt wrote a column about his attitude to women, in which he congratulated himself for not being Don Burke. \u201cI\u2019ve never told foul \u201cjokes\u201d to shock or belittle women,\u201d he boasted. \u201cNor am I the kind who shuts up while other blokes give women \u2013 or anyone else \u2013 a hard time.\u2019 Yes, Bolt wrote that in the wake of welcoming Yiannopoulous on stage to mock a teenager for being \u201cunfuckable\u201d. Predictably, Cory Bernardi was also in Adelaide to see Yiannopoulos \u2013 according to Bolt, he received a \u201chuge ovation\u201d as he walked in. Bernardi touts himself as a defender of \u201ctrue conservative values\u201d, yet there he was, at an event sponsored by the old-school pornographers of Penthouse, listening to a guy who once described underage sex as a \u201chugely positive experience\u201d. Why? Like Bolt, Bernardi recognises Yiannopoulos\u2019s star power, and he hopes some of it might rub off. But here\u2019s the thing: it won\u2019t. Bernardi might, perhaps, have been reading Dangerous, free copies of which were handed out in Melbourne to just about anyone who attended. The book is an attempt by Yiannopoulos to normalise his politics, explicitly disavowing those members of the alt right he calls \u201cHolocaust-deniers, Richard Spencer fans and Daily Stormer readers.\u201d Yet shortly after Dangerous appeared, Buzzfeed circulated footage of Yiannopoulos singing America the Beautiful in a karaoke bar. Nearby, a group of Richard Spencer fans (including Spencer himself), were raising arms in Hitler salutes. Yiannopoulos says his myopia rendered him oblivious to the Nazis\u2019 antics metres away from his performance. Maybe so. But in what kind of gathering does the presence of sieg heiling fascists cause insufficient disturbance to interrupt a song? Buzzfeed also challenged Milo\u2019s purported hostility to the Nazi Daily Stormer by leaking his correspondence with, and about, Andrew \u201cWeev\u201d Auernheimer, the Daily Stormer system administrator, a man with a giant swastika tattooed on his chest. \u201c[Weev] is one of the funniest, smartest and most interesting people I know,\u201d says Yiannopoulos in one email. \u201cVery on brand for me.\u201d Yiannopoulos may not be a fascist. But he knows that his act weaponises identity by tapping into deeply held conservative grievances. It provides a kind of vicarious catharsis through ostentatious transgression, something that Yiannopoulos can do (where, say, Bernardi cannot) precisely because he does not care about conventional politics. To put it another way, the people energised by Yiannopoulos calling feminists cunts are not going to devote themselves to Bernardi\u2019s Senate campaigns. Most of them, in fact, will remain indifferent to a mainstream political process that doesn\u2019t offer anything nearly as exciting as taboo slurs directed at Indigenous people. A few, however, might make different and more sinister choices. After all, if you really believe immigration is destroying Western civilisation, it\u2019s not such a leap to want to fight back. On Monday, after most of the audience had gone inside, Neil Erikson, the fascist agitator notorious for his harassment of Sam Dastyari, arrived at the pavilion to accost the leftwing protesters gathered nearby. Erikson\u2019s posse linked up with the other white nationalists drawn to the gig: grouplets including the True Blue Crew, the Soldiers of Odin and the United Patriots Front. They began brawling: with the Left, with the police and with the (mostly African) residents of the local housing commission flats. Yiannopoulos was inside and probably didn\u2019t even see the violence, inflicted primarily on the people of Kensington. He\u2019ll be gone tomorrow anyway, peddling his wares in a different city."
"0||Q&A: detention regime is designed to break refugees, says Gillian TriggsFormer human rights commissioner Gillian Triggs has described Australia\u2019s offshore detention regime as designed to \u201cbreak\u201d refugees, warning the inhumanity on Manus Island had reached such a point that \u201cas a nation, we have to respond\u201d. The plight of the hundreds of men on Manus Island provoked a fiery debate on ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A on Monday night, after a question from Sudanese refugee Abdul Aziz Muhamat. Labor senator Lisa Singh, whose party reopened offshore detention centres in 2012, said they may not have done so if they had known the situation would reach this point. \u201cI think if we were to reflect on where we are now, that this is not the point we would have agreed to have been at,\u201d Singh said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that ever was the intention.\u201d She said the government\u2019s refusal to accept New Zealand\u2019s offer to take 150 men suggested they wanted people to suffer or die. That provoked outrage from Liberal senator Eric Abetz, who labelled the comment as \u201chighly offensive\u201d. The Institute of Public Affairs director of policy Simon Breheny also dismissed any notion that the government was intentionally mistreating or inflicting cruelty on those in offshore detention. But Triggs, a vocal critic of the policy, said the evidence suggested otherwise. \u201cThis program is designed to break these people. And to send them back,\u201d she said. Abetz labelled the proposition as \u201cpreposterous\u201d. He asked why Australia could not at least celebrate stopping the boats and stopping drownings at sea. Triggs said offshore detention regime had now become Australia\u2019s shame. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult decision for both political parties,\u201d Triggs said. \u201cBut I think the inhumanity has reached a level where we, as a nation, we have to respond.\u201d Earlier, a young Muslim woman became emotional while telling the panellists of the the far-reaching impacts of Donald Trump\u2019s retweeting of far-fight group Britain First, which had tweeted inflammatory anti-Islamic content. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a struggle when you\u2019re living in a society where you think you\u2019re welcomed and you think the people around you are going to be there,\u201d she said. Breheny, of the IPA, dismissed the discussion about Trump\u2019s tweets, as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and lacking substance. He wanted to talk about Trump\u2019s proposed corporate tax cuts instead. Singh, the Labor senator, attacked him for what she described as flippancy. \u201cThat the president of the US, the leader of the free world is targeting a certain group within our society and that\u2019s having effects on the women here that have shared that experience with us tonight here in Australia,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThat\u2019s outrageous. It\u2019s terrible. And we can\u2019t be flippant about it.\u201d Singh was later asked whether Australians should be concerned about creeping foreign influence in the political system, given the recent revelations about Labor senator Sam Dastyari and Chinese donor Huang Xiangmo. The panel questioned the timing of the stories about Dastyari, given the many months that have passed since his meeting with Huang Xiangmo. Singh suggested Australia\u2019s intelligence agencies may have been \u201cpoliticised\u201d. \u201cIf our intelligence agencies are being politicised in some way by, willingly or unwillingly by the government, that is a huge concern, a huge concern,\u201d she said. Earlier, Triggs was confronted by Calum Thwaites, one of the students involved in the infamous racial discrimination case at the Queensland University of Technology. Triggs said she thought the commission handled the complaint excellently, and was constrained by a lack of contact details for the students and the university\u2019s insistence that they not be contacted, among other things. But Thwaites said: \u201cI can\u2019t understand Professor Triggs, how you think the commission acted excellently when seven students weren\u2019t told about the complaint for 14 months, regardless of what the university may or may not have said, when it wasn\u2019t their responsibility, statute or otherwise, to inform us,\u201d he said, \u201cAs a result of this seven students almost had their lives ruined.\u201d Triggs said she deeply regretted that the case was not settled. She said the commission\u2019s role was to deal with such complaints before they made it to court, which had failed in this instance. \u201cBut had we not made that, played that role of trying to achieve a conciliation between the parties, the complainant would have gone to the federal court in any event,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the role of the commission is really to provide an access to social justice, a way of solving a problem that avoids going to court... that failed in this case.\u201d"
"10||Labor pledges to introduce 10 days of paid domestic violence leaveLabor has joined calls for all employees to get 10 days paid domestic violence leave, in line with a campaign from the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Bill Shorten will announce on Tuesday that, if elected, Labor will legislate for 10 days paid domestic and family violence leave in the national employment standards. Paid leave gives employees time off to meet legal, medical, counselling, relocation and other administrative commitments to deal with or exit abusive or violent relationships. The workplace entitlement would be available to all employees if they or an immediate family member experience family or domestic violence. At the 2016 election Labor promised five days\u2019 of paid leave, but the commitment to 10 days brings it in line with the ACTU and the Greens, who promised last week to introduce a bill for 10 days. Shorten said Labor had upped its commitment because \u201cwe recognise the need to improve workplace support for survivors of family violence\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve listened to victims, frontline workers, business, and organisations that deal daily with domestic violence,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir clear message is that people who have experienced domestic violence need more support in the workplace.\u201d In 2017, 45 women have been killed through domestic violence and it is the leading cause of death, disability and illness among women aged 15 to 44 years of age. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that around two out of every three women who experience domestic violence are in the workforce. In a joint statement with the shadow minister for women, Tanya Plibersek, and shadow employment minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, Shorten said that workers should not have the stress of seeking legal advice and medical treatment \u201ccompounded by fear of losing your job or the financial disadvantage of going without pay\u201d. Labor accused the Turnbull government of \u201cvacating the field\u201d because they do not support paid domestic violence leave. \u201cThey see domestic violence leave as a cost to business and, in a terrifying display of how out of touch they are, argue that it will make women less attractive to employers,\u201d they said. In July the Fair Work Commission rejected the ACTU\u2019s bid for 10 days\u2019 paid domestic violence leave to be included in all modern awards but left the door open to the possibility of unpaid leave. Employer organisations opposed the new entitlement. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry claimed it could cost employers as much as $205m to create just one day of domestic violence leave per worker per year. Unions dispute the figure and suggest the cost would be closer to $11.8m, based on estimates that 2% of female workers and less than 1% of male workers take the leave each year when it is available to them. Labor said domestic violence leave would help businesses prevent loss of productivity, and increases employee retention and reduces unpredictable absenteeism. About 1.6m workers currently have access to paid family and domestic violence leave through enterprise bargaining or company policy. Labor acknowledged the many employers that already provide family violence leave, including Medicare, CUB, Telstra, NAB, Virgin Australia, IKEA and Qantas.

"11||BBCSSO/Vedernikov review \u2013  shock and awe bring Shostakovich's 11th to lifeShostakovich\u2019s 11th Symphony has always been a tricky work to interpret. Is it simply, as its subtitle \u201cThe Year 1905\u201d suggests, a party-approved memorial to a failed uprising against the tsar, a composer selling out, at least publicly, in the face of continuing pressure from the Soviet authorities? Or is it, as Shostakovich\u2019s alleged memoirs, the controversial \u201cTestimony\u201d, would have us believe, something darker and altogether more subtle: a coded elegy for the victims of the crushed Hungarian uprising of 1956, a protest against the regime cleverly disguised as pro-Soviet propaganda? Interpretation \u2013 and conviction \u2013 matters: this symphony and its companion piece the 12th have proved stumbling blocks for many otherwise laudable interpreters of Shostakovich\u2019s music, who have seemingly lacked belief in the musical and ideological merit of the work. On the strength of this performance, Alexander Vedernikov is not such a musician. Conducting the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, in what was surprisingly the orchestra\u2019s first performances of the work, Vedernikov showed himself to be an economical master of this music. This was a performance full of character but decidedly lacking in histrionics. From the outset, where glacial strings provide a backdrop for the recurring ghostly tattoo on the timpani \u2013 surely one of the most atmospheric of symphonic openings \u2013 this was a measured, almost cool performance that emphasised the work\u2019s Mahlerian scope and scale. There was superb playing from the orchestra, with some standout solos, from the clarion call of Mark O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s trumpet to the lyrical beauty of the violas quoting a revolutionary song lamenting the fate of fallen comrades. During James Horan\u2019s account of the perilously exposed cor anglais solo towards the end of the symphony you could have heard a pin drop in the Usher Hall. Vedernikov\u2019s approach to the symphony\u2019s frenzied closing bars was resolute and almost mechanistic: the great machine of the state overwhelming the people, be they anti-tsarist or Hungarian protesters. It was powerful, menacing stuff, and there was a sense that the Sunday-afternoon Edinburgh audience was more shellshocked than appreciative. Perhaps they had been lulled into a false sense of security by the more benign Russian world of the opening work in the concert, Tchaikovsky\u2019s familiar first piano concerto. Denis Kozhukhin was the soloist, giving a performance of crystalline clarity that downplayed the sentimentality in favour of understated lyricism, but with plenty of bravura power where it was needed. \u2022 The Glasgow performance of this concert is available on BBC iPlayer until 30 December."
"12||BBC launches Own It website to help under-12s navigate online risksTony Hall, the director-general of the BBC, has said the corporation can help \u201cminimise the risks\u201d for children in the digital world, as he announced its new website for nine to 12-year-olds. The site, called Own It, is the first product to be launched as part of the corporation\u2019s \u00a334m investment in children\u2019s programming over the next three years. Hall said the BBC\u2019s intervention would \u201cmaximise the amazing opportunities for children growing up in a fully connected world \u2013 but we must also take steps to minimise the risks\u201d. Own It will be delivered in partnership with a range of organisations in the field of child internet safety, and is supported by an \u201cengine room\u201d of expert advisers, doctors and academics. Hall said there were many important issues facing children today. \u201cIs there a right age for children to give informed consent for their data to be used online? What responsibility should organisations have to make sure their platform is right for the age range that are really using it?\u201d Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat require users to be at least 13. To create an account, users are asked for their date of birth, although Hall said the restriction was often flouted. On Snapchat, under-13s are redirected to a children\u2019s version, called SnapKidz. \u201cTwo-thirds of 10-year-olds in this country have a social media account \u2013 but we all know that\u2019s not supposed to happen until they\u2019re 13,\u201d Hall wrote. Own It, which will be available from 6 December, covers everything from online privacy and avoiding malware, to dealing with everyday dilemmas children face online. It will sit alongside CBeebies and CBBC and quick links to charities and organisations like Childline will also be available. The BBC was asked in March by Ofcom to produce more UK-commissioned programming for children. According to Ofcom, \u00a377m was spent on first-run UK-originated children\u2019s programming in 2015, down from \u00a3140m in 2005. The BBC is responsible for 97% of original UK-produced children\u2019s programming. Hall wrote in the Guardian: \u201cChildren\u2019s programming helps define our identity as a nation, and while there are many imports we all enjoy from the US, no one wants our children\u2019s culture defined in the west coast of America. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re renewing our focus on creating programmes and other content for children across the UK, reflecting their own lives and experiences back to them.\u201d The BBC has saved \u00a330m annually after scrapping the BBC3 TV channel aimed at 16 to 34-year-olds in favour of an online-only offering."
"7||Silicon Valley has remade our children\u2019s world \u2013 but they need British culture tooFor many of us in the media industry, competing successfully for young people\u2019s time and attention is one of the biggest challenges we face. Never have the rival claims on their time and energy from games, smartphones and traditional and social media been so intense. It\u2019s in all our interests to maximise the amazing opportunities for children growing up in a fully connected world \u2013 but we must also take steps to minimise the risks. There is so much that we don\u2019t know about how digital media affects young people. Researchers and scientists worldwide are working right now to get to grips with every aspect \u2013 from the impact on their behaviours and values, to their mental and physical health, to their physiological development. There will be no easy answers. And if it\u2019s tough for parents, experts and tech leaders to understand the forces at play, it\u2019s far tougher for children. Children may have all the technological know-how at their disposal, but there is no evidence that the emotional development of today\u2019s young people is any more advanced than their grandparents\u2019. We know this makes them vulnerable. That is something everyone should be deeply concerned about. There are many important issues. Is there a right age for children to give consent for their data to be used online? What responsibility should organisations have to make sure their platform is appropriate for the age range that is using it? Three quarters of 10- to 12-year-olds in the UK have a social media account \u2013 but that\u2019s not supposed to happen until they\u2019re 13. What about terms and conditions? How can we expect children to make sense of these when adults often cannot? For me such questions serve to underline that it is more important than ever that we step up and act. Instead of thinking about how we might restrict children\u2019s activities in the digital world, we need to focus on how we build a world that gives them freedom, that equips them with the skills they need to make the most of that freedom. We need to work together, across international boundaries \u2013 just like the media platforms we all use \u2013 to find a way to provide them with a world that is fun, playful, clear and above all safe. The BBC is proud to be part of the taskforce brought together by the Duke of Cambridge and the Royal Foundation spearheading the Stop, Speak, Support campaign \u2013 a green cross code for cyberbullying. In addition we are launching a brand new website, designed specifically to help children develop the confidence and resilience they need to thrive in the digital space. It\u2019s aimed at nine- to 12-year-olds \u2013 those we know are particularly affected by the day-to-day pressures of life online \u2013 and it offers them guidance on what they want help with. It\u2019s called Own It, because it\u2019s there to help them be the bosses of their online lives. Our goal is to create a single place where children can find everything they need to navigate the internet. And it\u2019s all supported by an \u201cengine room\u201d of advisers \u2013 doctors and academics who are specialists in this field. Own It is part of the BBC\u2019s biggest investment in children\u2019s content for a generation. We\u2019re committing an additional \u00a334m to help us reimagine how we serve our youngest audiences in the years ahead. It\u2019s an investment in Britain, reflecting British culture and values. Children\u2019s programming helps define our identity as a nation, and while there are many US imports we all enjoy, no one wants our children\u2019s culture to be defined by the west coast of America. So we\u2019ll always focus on creating programmes and other content for children across the UK, reflecting their own lives and experiences back to them. We need to do everything we can, right now, to create a media future for children that we can be proud of, so we can all look back in 10 years\u2019 time and be sure that we didn\u2019t let a generation down. \u2022 Tony Hall is director general of the BBC"
"1||Bristol City\u2019s Joe Bryan offers to pay for non-league player\u2019s physiotherapyBristol City full-back Joe Bryan has earned praise from a local non-league side after agreeing to pay for physiotherapy sessions to help one of their players recover from a serious injury. Nailsea &amp; Tickenham FC thanked Bryan for his \u201camazing gesture\u201d after he reached out to Chris Corner, who suffered a broken tibia and fibula in a match against Uphill Castle in November. The injury also left Corner, a self-employed builder, unable to work for several months. Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol, Bryan said: \u201cScott Murray [Bristol City\u2019s kit manager] tweeted about it I thought, he\u2019s a fellow footballer and self-employed, with Christmas coming up.\u201d \u201cOne of our physios plays in the [Nailsea] team so I just said to him, \u2018can you get him back fit and invoice everything to me?\u2019 I\u2019m in a position where I can do things like that, and help out where I can. I\u2019ve been brought up like that.\u201d \u201cWe all dread any sort of serious injury like this,\u201d Bryan added. \u201cI\u2019ve had a far less serious one and I know the psychological pain that you go through.\u201d Midfielder Corner confirmed that he had fractured his tibia and fibula while playing for the Somerset County Premier League side. He has had surgery to insert a metal rod in his leg and is wearing a protective boot. He told BBC Radio Bristol\u2019s John Darvall he will be unable to work until March at the earliest. \u201cIt was a fair tackle, nothing nasty about it,\u201d Corner said. \u201cI went in really hard and his foot has caught me under my shinpad and broken my tibia.\u201d Nailsea &amp; Tickenham, who play in the 11th tier of English football, have also arranged a fundraising raffle for Corner with prizes donated by players from Bristol City and Bristol Rovers. Bryan has been a first-team regular for the Robins as they have defied pre-season expectations in the Championship. The left-back, who was born in Bristol and came through the club\u2019s youth academy, scored the opening goal as Bristol City beat Middlesbrough on Saturday to climb to third in the table."
"8||The key sticking points holding up UK's divorce deal with EUThe Irish border The border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland remains the main roadblock in the path to progress to phase two of the Brexit talks this month. On Monday all parties initially appeared to be confident that a deal could be reached that would avoid any hard border, which might upset peace in the north of the island after decades of violence. Ireland insists a hard border would not just create trade barriers, it would also impact on social cohesion in border communities. Theresa May sat down to lunch with European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, hoping that a last-minute offer to the Irish government of \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d on both sides of a new UK-EU land border \u2013 apparently allowing people and goods to cross the border with no checks \u2013 would remove one of the last remaining obstacles to a deal. But that raised the question of whether Northern Ireland would have special status, or whether the rest of the UK would also be expected to comply with some EU rules. The leaders of Scotland and Wales, and the mayor of London, announced that if Northern Ireland were to gain special status, they might want it too. As May and Juncker spoke in Brussels and the pound rose on prospects of free trade and perhaps even a very \u201csoft Brexit\u201d, Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist party (DUP) issued an uncompromising reiteration of its refusal to accept any \u201cdivergence\u201d from rules on the British mainland. May, who is dependent on DUP votes for a majority in Westminster following the Conservatives\u2019 poor result in the June snap election, appeared with Juncker on Monday afternoon to declare that the deal had not been reached after all. The Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said he has had confirmation from Juncker that Monday\u2019s agreed text still stands. He said the DUP\u2019s position was important and denied he was pursing any agenda, a reference to accusations that he was pursuing a united Ireland. Citizens\u2019 rights In October the British government claimed that a deal on citizens\u2019 rights was \u201cwithin touching distance\u201d, but there remains at least one major stumbling block to an agreement on the issue: the role of the European court of justice (ECJ) in resolving any disputes after Brexit. EU negotiators are adamant that the UK must give EU citizens certainty that they will be protected by EU law. They want any agreement to be a reflection of treaty article 267, meaning that Britain\u2019s supreme court would be obliged to refer citizens\u2019 rights disputes to the ECJ. In September the British government appeared to concede that European law would take \u201cdirect effect\u201d when it came to protecting the rights of EU nationals living in the UK, meaning they could appeal to UK courts citing European law as enshrined in the withdrawal treaty. But European diplomats say Britain\u2019s offer now appears not to be so clear-cut. While UK ministers are reportedly considering a plan that would involve some cases being voluntarily referred to the ECJ, leading Brexiters oppose any ongoing role for the ECJ in the rights of EU nationals in the UK. The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith was among several former ministers to say such an arrangement would be unacceptable, arguing that it would mean \u201cceding power to a foreign court on which [Britain] has no representation\u201d. The European parliament, which wields a veto over the Brexit deal, wrote last month to both negotiating teams highlighting a number of other issues that still need to be addressed to safeguard the rights of the 3.2 million EU27 citizens living in the UK and 900,000 British citizens in other member states. In particular, MEPs on the Brexit steering committee have said the UK\u2019s proposed application procedure for EU nationals did not meet the parliament\u2019s demands that claims to remain should be processed without conditions, including a criminal records check or a cost to applicants. The issues of family reunification \u2013 with Britain proposing that EU nationals would have to meet the same income threshold set for British nationals who want to bring a spouse from a non-EU state to Britain \u2013 and of the rights of EU nationals\u2019 children born after Brexit, have also been major sticking points. Additionally, the UK has demanded the EU guarantee so-called onward movement rights for British nationals on the continent, allowing them to move to any other member state after Brexit in exchange for an indefinite right to return for EU nationals living in the UK. The divorce bill The Brexit divorce bill has dominated headlines for months, but is turning out to be the easier bit of Britain\u2019s negotiations to leave the EU. While Ireland and citizens\u2019 rights pose intractable problems about preserving peace and the role of the European court, British and EU negotiators are used to haggling over money. A breakthrough on the bill came last week, when the UK offered to stand behind obligations to the EU that could total \u20ac60bn (\u00a350bn) \u2013 an acknowledgement that the EU accepts as progress enough for the time being. The final sum has not been agreed, and British officials think the UK\u2019s liabilities are far lower. The settlement includes UK payments to the current EU budget, the UK\u2019s share of the EU\u2019s unpaid bills, EU staff pensions, loan guarantees, plus many ad-hoc schemes such as aid for Syrian refugees in Turkey. Final agreement on the money is unlikely to emerge until the 11th hour of talks in autumn 2018, but even that will be a ballpark figure. The exact sum may not be known for decades, as it depends on unpredictable and contingent factors \u2013 from the lifespan of EU civil servants to whether Greece defaults on 40-year-long, EU-backed loans. Even an interim deal this week is far from the end of the story. Not only do the UK and the EU still have to work out the painstaking details, but money will loom large in talks about a future trade relationship. For the UK, the Brexit bill is the price of a future trade deal; for the EU, it is about settling past debts. Arguments between London and Brussels about money look set to continue for years to come."
"0||Morning mail: ABC radio current affairs programs slashedGood morning, this is Mike Ticher, standing in for Eleanor Ainge Roy, bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 5 December. Top stories Two of the ABC\u2019s flagship radio current affairs programs will be halved in length as part of a radical reshaping of afternoon and evening radio, the broadcaster\u2019s staff were told at a meeting on Monday. PM and The World Today will become 30-minute programs from 22 January under the new plans, and the Business PM slot will be axed, employees were told by Tanya Nolan, the managing editor of audio current affairs. The reductions will make space for a new \u201centertaining\u201d national program on ABC Local Radio hosted by the former Triple J presenter Myf Warhurst, which is designed to attract 30- to 40-year-olds with a \u201clighter\u201d offering. Nolan, who also oversees RN Breakfast, AM, Background Briefing and RN Drive, told staff the shortened programs \u201cwould leave the audience wanting more\u201d. The rationale behind the changes is understood to be research showing significant increases in audiences consuming on-demand audio and digital content and a drop in the numbers listening to linear broadcasts on the ABC. The under-55 audience was not coming to the ABC as it once did, and something had to be done to reverse the trend, staff were told. The citizenship saga focuses on House of Representatives members today, after yesterday\u2019s declarations by senators revealed Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher as the latest MP likely to face a high court referral. But proving citizenship credentials has been uniquely troubling for one overlooked group of parliamentarians. Indigenous MPs have told Guardian Australia the process resurfaced a \u201clegacy of hurt and pain\u201d by reminding them that previous governments never registered their relatives\u2019 births or recognised them as citizens. Linda Burney, a Wiradjuri woman, said being forced to justify her place in Australia again was \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d. Burney did not become a citizen until she was 10, and had to search through old Aboriginal Protection Board records to find a document written by her grandfather requesting permission to build a home. \u201cI have been made to feel quite angry about what I had to go through,\u201d Burney said. Expectations of a Brexit deal between the UK and European Union have been dashed after a frantic day of negotiations in Brussels. The parties had appeared confident of an agreement, but the increasingly thorny issue of the Irish border proved the stumbling block. It appeared that the Democratic Unionist party, whose votes are keeping Theresa May\u2019s government in power, refused to accept compromise language that they perceived meant Northern Ireland would be given a different status from the rest of the UK in order to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker insisted his talks with Theresa May had not failed, but the UK prime minister told reporters \u201csome differences do remain\u201d. Most voters would not change their intentions at the next election if there was a change of leadership of the Liberal party, the latest Guardian Essential poll has found. Among those sampled, 18% said a change would make them more likely to vote for the government at the next election, 13% said less likely, and 54% said it would make no difference. The poll suggests Malcolm Turnbull remains the top choice as Liberal leader, although his support has dropped 4% since August, and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, is only just behind the prime minister on a ranking of six named contenders. Turnbull attracted 21% support and Bishop 19%, but 15% nominated \u201csomeone else\u201d and 27% replied \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. The civil war in Yemen has taken a dramatic new turn after Houthi rebels backed by Iran killed the former president, punishing him for switching sides and seeking peace with Saudi Arabia. Pictures of the corpse of Ali Abdullah Saleh appeared on Houthi-run television after the militia claimed it had killed him as he fled the capital, Sana\u2019a, on Monday. He had ruled Yemen for more than 30 years but was forced to resign in 2011 during the Arab spring. Houthi military officials said Saleh was killed as he and other top party leaders were travelling from Sana\u2019a to his hometown of Sanhan. Gruesome video of his blood-spattered body was distributed on social media.

But a report from the Grattan Institute suggests the effects on the economy are less damaging than many people think, even though consumers still deserve greater protection, writes Greg Jericho.

"8||Rampant optimism over Irish border deal proves entirely misplacedAt the headquarters of the European commission, the famous yellow stars were confidently aligned. Theresa May had flown over for a quick, but historic, lunch. The commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was wearing his special Burberry tie to celebrate. His EU council counterpart, Donald Tusk, was cheerfully misquoting the Boomtown Rats on the subject of whether Mondays were a good start to the week. Eighteen months after the Brexit referendum, and eight weeks since their last deadline passed, this was finally meant to be the day they would settle the terms of Britain\u2019s divorce agreement and open phase two talks on future trade. May had conceded, or was close to conceding, all their first-phase demands: the scale of the financial settlement, a way to involve the European court of justice in guaranteeing citizens\u2019 rights and a form of words on keeping the Irish border open. Unfortunately nothing else went to plan. As the day unfolded like an episode of The Thick of It, the politicians in Brussels found themselves upstaged by a bitter historical drama in Ireland that has caused heartache and misery for many before them. Careful diplomatic choreography that was intended to please audiences in both Dublin and Belfast left everyone flat on their faces. The first clue that the optimism was both rampant and misplaced came shortly after the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, was photographed arriving for an emergency meeting of his cabinet still dressed in his running gear. After months of uncertainty over whether to believe British assurances about avoiding a hard border, Dublin suddenly seemed not just satisfied but delighted. Leaks to the Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 revealed that all sides were ready to accept compromise language designed to provide a back-stop in case Downing Street failed to achieve its ambitious trade goals. \u201cIn the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will ensure that there is continued regulatory alignment from those rules of internal market and customs union which, now or in the future, support north-south cooperation and protection of the Good Friday agreement,\u201d read the leaked draft. Earlier Irish demands for \u201cno regulatory divergence\u201d had been removed from the draft, but Varadkar was happy that it amounted to the same thing. Britain was prepared to guarantee that if all else failed, it would keep close enough to Brussels regulations that there would be no need for border checks and customs posts. \u201cWhen it comes to avoiding regularly divergence and regulatory alignment, those two things mean the same in our view and we were happy to accept either,\u201d said the taoiseach afterwards. Whether this meant special treatment for Northern Ireland or a wider willingness for Britain to stay \u201caligned\u201d with the EU in other ways was so far unclear, but pretty soon everyone was looking for a piece of the action. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, quickly chimed in. \u201cIf one part of UK can retain regulatory alignment with EU and effectively stay in the single market (which is the right solution for Northern Ireland) there is surely no good practical reason why others can\u2019t,\u201d she wrote. Then Sadiq Khan joined in, too. \u201cHuge ramifications for London if Theresa May has conceded that it\u2019s possible for part of the UK to remain within the single market &amp; customs union after Brexit,\u201d wrote the capital\u2019s mayor. \u201cLondoners overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and a similar deal here could protect tens of thousands of jobs.\u201d The Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, was not far behind. The trouble was that agreeing to keep British rules aligned with Brussels would rather undermine the whole point of Brexit. Already Brexiters were being asked to swallow a bucket-load of humble pie. Many of May\u2019s stubborn red lines, such as a refusal to countenance any role for the ECJ, were in tatters. The promises made to voters before and after the referendum were looking dangerously hollow. Among the day\u2019s many scheduled dance steps was a briefing for Conservative MPs in Westminster at which Brexit minister Steve Baker and May\u2019s former chief whip Gavin Barwell would be required to explain how all this was consistent with the \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d bombast they had been promised. So with Tory backbenchers breathing down her neck, and every one of the opposition parties in Westminster seeking to make political capital, the prime minister walked into her lunch at the Berlaymont building reliant on the one group of MPs that have consistently propped up her minority government since the ill-fated general election. Quite what prompted the Democratic Unionist party to desert May in her hour of need will be debated for weeks to come. Perhaps the Dublin government\u2019s triumphalism had spooked the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, into doubting that a fudge was possible. Perhaps Downing Street had failed to convey its belief that the promise of north-south \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d did not necessarily mean a widening east-west divergence with the rest of the UK. Either way, Foster\u2019s televised statement in Belfast shortly after lunch began in Brussels was to prove devastating. Not just were May\u2019s minority partners making clear that there was no way they would tolerate British regulatory divergence for the sake of Brexit, but they regarded the whole issue as a plot by the Irish government to undermine the union itself. \u201cThey [Dublin] are clearly seeking to unilaterally change that Belfast [peace] agreement without our input or our consent,\u201d fumed Foster. \u201cAnd of course we will not stand for that.\u201d Like many British prime ministers before her, May temporarily left the room in Brussels to try to placate her freshly enraged partners in Belfast. But this was going to take more than an awkward pause between courses to sort out and all sides agreed to abandon talks for the day. \u201cWe were narrowing our positions to a huge extent extent,\u201d lamented Juncker. May\u2019s terse acknowledgement of the need for \u201cfurther negotiation and consultation\u201d also put a brave face on the impasse but suggested any narrowing may, for now, have proved illusory."
"10||Ministers defend record on social mobility but can't name policiesThe government has defended its commitment to improving social mobility for the most disadvantaged people, despite the resignation of the social mobility commission board, but ministers struggled to name any proposals recommended by the body that had been adopted in the past year. In an urgent parliamentary question triggered by the resignations, the minister for children and families, Robert Goodwill, insisted the government would appoint a new board and continue to work to improve social mobility. The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, secured an urgent question on the decision of the former Labour health secretary Alan Milburn, the former Conservative education secretary Baroness Gillian Shephard and two other board members to resign in protest at the lack of progress towards a \u201cfairer Britain\u201d. Pointing out that \u201cgeographical division in Britain is more extreme than in any other country in Europe\u201d, Cable echoed concerns expressed by Milburn in his resignation letter and warned that \u201cBrexit is sucking the life out of government\u201d, making it impossible for officials to focus on important long-term goals such as improving the life chances for the most disadvantaged. Goodwill replied: \u201cWhilst Brexit is an important priority of this government, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. We are committed to improving this process of improving social mobility for everyone in this country.\u201d The government came under further pressure from the former education secretary Nicky Morgan, who warned that the resignation of Shephard \u201cshould be a major cause for concern for Downing Street\u201d. She pointed to Theresa May\u2019s stated determination to create a fairer Britain when she became prime minister and \u201cspoke about supporting the \u2018just about managing\u2019. All Conservatives know that \u2018aspiration\u2019 is a key watchword for any Conservative-led administration. So what has gone wrong?\u201d Morgan argued in an article for the Conservative Home website that the \u201ctrue cost of Brexit is not the likely divorce bill\u201d, but the oxygen that \u201chas been sucked out of Whitehall by Brexit, since the best brains in government are now working in our EU-facing departments\u201d. The shadow education secretary, Angela Raynor, asked why \u201cin the year since the commission\u2019s 2016 report, the government has not adopted a single one of its recommendations\u201d. She said: \u201cWhen a former Tory education secretary resigns from a Tory government\u2019s commission we know this goes well beyond party politics.\u201d The former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the commission was created when he was in the coalition government to break free of short-term, party-political policy cycles and focus on the long term. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything about social mobility unless you consistently apply policies over a long period of time stretching across different parliaments. So it is very dispiriting that the pendulum swing of short-termism has won out again,\u201d he said. He said the commission\u2019s resignations were an understandable response to the myopia that had descended on a government focused on trying to untangle Brexit negotiations. \u201cIf you really care about the upwelling of social discontent that lay behind some of the Brexit vote, then the last thing you should do is spend all your time immersed in negotiating in Brussels \u2013 you should be spending time trying to fix age-old problems like a lack of housing, lack of skills, lack of wage progression,\u201d he said."
"8||Deal or no deal? Confused May in alignment only with herself over Irish issueShortly after 4pm, Jean-Claude Juncker and Theresa May appeared for a hastily convened press conference in Brussels. The president of the EU commission went first and was at pains to be complimentary to the British prime minister. Theresa was a tough negotiator, he said. It wouldn\u2019t harm to flatter her a bit. And besides, anyone was tough compared with David Davis. At least she understood what was at stake. But there was still no agreement that could progress the talks as there were two or three issues that had still to be resolved. Though nothing that couldn\u2019t be sorted by the end of the week. The British had already caved in to almost everything else the EU had demanded and he was fairly sure she would roll over on Ireland. It was just a matter of her finding the right form of words to convince the DUP and the hardline Brexiteers that she hadn\u2019t capitulated when she had really. The prime minister remembered things slightly differently. Juncker had been exaggerating when he had said there were still two or three issues to resolve. There were just two. Ireland and one other one, which she couldn\u2019t quite remember. Though she too was quietly confident she would give in later in the week. She tried out a nervous smile that she hoped suggested more steel than desperation. It didn\u2019t. That was all that either Juncker or May had time for. Theresa had a pressing engagement with Donald Tusk so wouldn\u2019t be able to take any questions. Soz. Just as well, really as she sure as hell wouldn\u2019t have had any answers. It would take her a while to work out just what had happened. The prime minister\u2019s confusion had started early in the day when Davis had told reporters he felt sure a deal could be done today. As the Brexit secretary is almost always wrong about everything \u2013 he had even imagined the impact assessments existed in excruciating detail when they hadn\u2019t actually been written \u2013 Theresa had been alerted to the fact that things weren\u2019t going to be easy. But even she hadn\u2019t banked on it being this hard. \u201cAre you sure we can\u2019t fudge the Northern Ireland border issue just a little bit?\u201d she had asked Juncker on arrival in Brussels. Juncker had sniggered. Absolutely not. What bit of \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d did she not get? Theresa had another go. How about we say that pigs, cheese and a few cows are allowed to wander across the border without a passport? So you\u2019re basically giving in and accepting that Northern Ireland must stay inside the single market and the customs union, Juncker had observed. Mmm, yes and no, Theresa whispered, checking over her shoulder to make sure no one was listening. It was like this. Regulatory divergence and regulatory alignment could almost mean exactly the same thing. It just depended which side you were looking at it from. The secret was to persuade the divergers that you weren\u2019t aligning and the aligners you weren\u2019t diverging by drafting something that was equally open to misinterpretation by both. \u201cWhatever,\u201d Juncker had yawned. Having persuaded herself she had got a deal she could sell \u2013 to herself if no one else \u2013 Theresa set about drafting an agreement with the Irish government. As the news seeped out that an agreement had been reached, all hell broke loose. If the Northern Irish could have a special nod and a wink for pigs, the Scots must have the same exemptions for scotch. And heather. Then London started making demands. Just because it could. It had never fancied leaving the EU anyway. By the time Cornwall had got in on the act by insisting its dogs be allowed to surf wherever they wanted, it dawned on the prime minister that maybe she ought to run the agreement past the DUP. Arlene Foster\u2019s response had been unequivocal. Theresa could keep her \u00a31bn. Any deal that didn\u2019t make Northern Ireland exactly the same as the rest of the UK was unacceptable. No special status, no nothing. And if push came to shove, she\u2019d bring down the UK government. Theresa giggled nervously. Perhaps it hadn\u2019t been such a good idea to get into bed with the DUP after all. Still, too late now. That deal she\u2019d said she had agreed to just a few minutes ago? It now turned out she couldn\u2019t agree to it after all. Not yet at any rate. Just give her a few days to see if there was any way of pulling the wool over the eyes of the DUP and twisting the arms of the handful of hardliners in her own party who couldn\u2019t bear the idea of anything that smacked of remaining in the single market. All for none and none for all. Juncker sighed. He needed a drink badly. Another one. It was a three-bottle day. Every time he thought the UK couldn\u2019t get any more incompetent, it somehow managed to surprise him. John Crace\u2019s new book, I, Maybot, is published by Guardian Faber.

"6||ExxonMobil Australia to face Senate scrutiny after paying no tax on $18bn incomeA Senate committee will investigate ExxonMobil\u2019s Australian tax records following revelations the oil and gas company paid no corporate income tax in Australia for at least two years. Public records released by the Australian Tax Office (ATO) show ExxonMobil Australia reported no taxable income and paid no corporate tax in 2013-14 and 2014-15, despite reporting an annual income of $9.6bn and $8.5bn respectively. For the same period, Woodside, an Australian-owned oil and gas company with a slightly lower total income than ExxonMobil and a declared taxable income of $4.8bn from 2013-2015, paid $1.1bn in Australian corporate tax. The Senate committee inquiry into corporate tax avoidance is expected to announce on Tuesday that it plans to extend its hearings to examine ExxonMobil\u2019s records, after three trade unions announced the findings of a report on the company\u2019s conduct. The report, by Tax Justice Network\u2019s Jason Ward, cited the company\u2019s US filings that showed it had US$54bn in \u201cindefinitely reinvested, undistributed earnings\u201d in offshore holdings. It traced its ownership though the Netherlands to the Bahamas, where, according to the Paradise Papers, it has 575 subsidiaries, including three directly linked to Australia. Exxon\u2019s 2016 filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also state the ATO was still examining its Australian tax filings from 2008 to 2016. Ward said ExxonMobil also had $18.5bn in offshore-related party loans and suggested it was \u201cmore aggressive\u201d in pursuing this policy than fellow oil and gas company Chevron, which reached a reported $1bn settlement with the ATO after the federal court found against it in a landmark profit-shifting decision in April. Chevron had $42bn in related party debt, while Exxon has $18.5bn in consolidated related party debt. Exxon made $1.2bn in debt repayments in 2016, amounting to 1.7% of its total revenue. \u201cThe scale of Exxon is significantly smaller than Chevron, but it looks like they are even more aggressive in their tactics,\u201d Ward told Guardian Australia. In a 2015 submission to the Senate inquiry on tax avoidance, Exxon said the ATO was reviewing its international related-party financial dealings. \u201cWe are not aware of any negative finding by the ATO in respect of these dealings,\u201d it said. Ward also suggested Exxon had failed to disclose its offshore ownership structure. The ATO began publicly releasing corporate tax data only two years ago. Data for the 2015-16 financial year is expected to be released on Friday. The full Tax Justice Network report is also expected to be released on Friday. New South Wales Labor senator Jenny McAllister, who sits on the committee, said it was her \u201cstrong view\u201d the committee should examine allegations Exxon \u201cengaged in aggressive corporate tax avoidance\u201d. \u201cIf true, reports that Exxon can simultaneously report a total $18bn of revenue, whilst paying no corporate tax sound implausible,\u201d McAllister said, in a statement to Guardian Australia. \u201cI am also concerned about the company\u2019s attempts to slash the wages and conditions of the workers who do the work that allow them to record such healthy returns.\u201d The Electrical Trades Union, Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union, and Australian Workers\u2019 Union presented the findings in Canberra on Monday. Unions have been engaged in a long-running dispute with Exxon subsidiary Esso and contractor UGL over the wages and conditions at its Bass Strait operations. Ged Kearney, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said the report showed Australia\u2019s tax rules were \u201cbroken\u201d. \u201cWe need to change the rules so that parliamentary intervention is not required to get a company to pay its taxes and working people are not forced out of decent, paying jobs,\u201d Kearney said. In a statement, a spokesman for ExxonMobil said the union\u2019s protest against the company \u201ccontinues to provide misinformation about ExxonMobil\u201d. \u201cExxonMobil Australia\u2019s entities have made a significant contribution to the Australian economy through the reliable supply of energy to fuel economic growth, as well as through direct tax and royalty payments to state and federal governments,\u201d he said. The statement did not address the information in publicly available ATO data, which showed zero Australian corporate income tax paid in 2013-14 and 2014-15. It went on to summarise a document titled \u201ctax facts\u201d linked from the front page of ExxonMobil Australia\u2019s website, which said it paid more than $2bn a year in total taxes and stood behind its returns positions. \u201cWe hold a documented, longstanding reputation with tax authorities for integrity and professionalism,\u201d it said. The statement also said Exxon had paid $12bn in the petroleum resource rent tax over its Gippsland Basin and Bass Strait operations, managed by Esso, since that tax was introduced in 1990. Those payments are listed in the ATO\u2019s database. It said it experienced a corporate income tax loss in 2016 and \u201cexpect to continue to be in an income tax loss position in the short term while the significant recent investment we have made generates sufficient income streams to offset past losses.\u201d"

"13||Schumer and Pelosi accept Trump invitation to discuss spending dealThe top two Democrats in Congress said on Monday that they had accepted a White House invitation for a face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump on Thursday, in hopes of resolving troublesome issues that are blocking a government spending deal. A temporary spending bill runs out at midnight on Friday, raising the possibility of a government shutdown. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, said in a statement Congress and the Trump administration needed to reach a deal to increase money for defense and domestic priorities. \u201cWe have to provide funding for community health centers and Chip [the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program],\u201d they added, \u201cas well as relief for the millions of Americans still reeling from natural disasters.\u201d Chip is a 1997 program that provides health insurance cover for about nine million children and nearly 400,000 pregnant women nationwide. Its funding was allowed to lapse in October, amid fights over the future of the Affordable Care Act. Democrats have charged Republicans with not doing anything to replace it. One of the creators of Chip, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, said last week: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do Chip. There\u2019s no question about it in my mind.\u201d Pelosi and Schumer added: \u201cWe must also come together on a bipartisan deal to pass the Dream Act along with tough border security measures.\u201d In September, Trump announced the end of Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers. Democrats have made the issue a central part of negotiations with the president since. Trump initially signalled that he would be receptive on the issue but in October Democrats rejected as \u201cimmoral\u201d a list of Trump demands in return for action on Dreamers. Those demands included funding for a wall on the Mexico border and a crackdown on admittance of children from Central America. Pelosi and Schumer abruptly backed out of a planned meeting last week after Trump attacked them on Twitter, writing: \u201cMeeting with \u2018Chuck and Nancy\u2019 today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our country unchecked, are weak on crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don\u2019t see a deal!\u201d Trump subsequently staged a political stunt, running a meeting with empty chairs left for the absent Democratic leaders. On Monday, Schumer and Pelosi said they hoped Trump would go into this week\u2019s meeting with an open mind, rather than dismissing the possibility of a deal beforehand. They insisted: \u201cThere is a bipartisan path forward on all of these items.\u201d"

He could finish only seventh of the 10 runners in March, however, after an uncharacteristically sloppy round of jumps, and was subsequently diagnosed with a stress fracture of the pelvis. The race was ultimately won by Special Tiara, who held on by a neck to beat Colin Tizzard\u2019s Fox Norton, the subsequent winner of two Grade One events. Both horses are still engaged in Saturday\u2019s race, with Fox Norton, who reversed the Festival form when he finished eight lengths in front of Special Tiara in the Shloer Chase at Cheltenham in November, second-favourite in the ante-post betting at 5-2, behind Douvan at a top price of 5-6. \u201cThe Tingle Creek has been the plan for Fox Norton since the end of last season,\u201d Joe Tizzard, the son of the chaser\u2019s trainer Colin, said on Monday. \u201cWe had a lovely run on his reappearance at Cheltenham, when he was mightily impressive. It will be interesting to see if Douvan comes over or not, but we are looking forward to the challenge. Bryan Cooper will be riding him again.\u201d Un De Sceaux, last year\u2019s Tingle Creek winner and a stable companion of Douvan, is also a possible runner, but in recent days the betting has suggested that Douvan is more likely to line up with Un De Sceaux potentially heading to Sunday\u2019s Hilly Way Chase in Ireland instead. Paul Nicholls, who has won the Sandown race a record nine times with horses including Kauto Star and Master Minded, is also represented in the entries with Politologue, who took the Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter on his seasonal debut in November and is a 13-2 chance to follow up this weekend. \u201cSan Benedeto is more likely to go for the Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon on Sunday,\u201d Nicholls said. Sandown officials could lay frost covers as early as Wednesday in an attempt to defeat the cold snap that has been widely forecast for the end of the week, before removing and then relaying the covers on the first day of the Tingle Creek meeting on Friday. \u201cEvery forecast you look at suggests the first three days this week are pretty innocuous,\u201d Andrew Cooper, the clerk of the course at Sandown, said on Monday. \u201cIt will be wet and windy on Thursday, with perhaps as much as 10mm of rain, then that will clear east allowing cold air in from the north. \u201cThe worst forecast for Friday night is for -3C, and then up to 5C during the day on Saturday. We\u2019ll aim to get the covers down on Wednesday ahead of the rain and manage things from there.\u201d Willy Twiston-Davies, who has not ridden in public since injuring two vertebrae and two ribs in a fall on the opening day of the Cheltenham Festival in March, has retired from race-riding. Twiston-Davies, whose brother Sam is stable jockey to Paul Nicholls, rode more than 200 winners on the Flat, including Primitivo in the King George V Handicap at Royal Ascot in 2016. He also took the Fox Hunters\u2019 Chase over the Grand National fences at Aintree in 2011 as a 16-year-old amateur rider. \u201cIn some ways it was a tough decision to make,\u201d Twiston-Davies said, \u201cand obviously I will miss it a lot, but at the same time I can see myself training one day, perhaps when dad [Nigel] calls it a day, and I\u2019m also keen to concentrate on the bloodstock side of things.\u201d Greg Woods\u2019 tips for Tuesday Southwell 12.20 Irish Octave 12.50 Get Rhythm 1.20 Aloomomo 1.50 Red Rising (nb) 2.20 Sir Egbert 2.50 Yasir 3.20 Doctor Dex Wolverhampton 12.40 Jack Of Diamonds 1.10 Rich Again 1.40 Bath And Tennis 2.10 Point Hope 2.40 Frederic (nap) 3.10 Tatlisu 3.40 Peak Hill 4.10 My Brunette Lingfield Park 1.00 Mystical Clouds 1.30 Glorvina 2.00 Tzar De L\u2019Elfe 2.30 Clayton 3.00 Allthegear No Idea 3.30 Hadfield"
"7||The Guardian view on the Brexit talks: no veto for the DUPThe former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern was famous for political negotiating guile. He had one golden rule: brinkmanship is politically essential to sell a deal to the mistrustful. Even if the sides were close to agreement in private, it was important to give the impression to supporters that the wrangling went down to the wire. So the beer and sandwiches had to be delivered in plain view, and the lights had to stay on through the night, so that, as dawn broke, all could emerge to claim a hard-won victory. A little of that sort of choreography may have been going on this week as the UK and the European commission edged towards what both of them appear to want \u2013 an agreement that \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been achieved in phase one of the Brexit negotiations to allow the two sides to move on to part two at the EU summit next week. All sides need to show suspicious supporters that they are battling to the end. Yet although much of what happened in Brussels on Monday was consistent with such cynicism, it also became clear that something must give on the British side if the multiple disaster of no-deal, still craved by the Tory party\u2019s anti-European and deregulatory zealots, is to be avoided. At the start of the day, Theresa May\u2019s talks with Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk were being reported as almost a done deal. As the May-Juncker lunch neared, however, the Democratic Unionists marched down the Stormont staircase to raise doubts, though not new ones, about the Irish dimension. By the time Mrs May and Mr Juncker belatedly appeared in public, it was clear the deal was in fact not yet done. Though the language between the two was mutually courteous and complimentary, \u201ca couple of issues\u201d remained to be sorted later in the week. That may indeed happen. In this hall of political mirrors no one need be surprised if those remaining issues are resolvable (or fudgeable), at least to the extent of allowing disagreements to be carried forward into the next phase of the process. Yet the current taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, could not have been clearer. He thought there had been a deal. Britain had signed off on it. Ireland had signed off too. It was the DUP \u2013 which has to play to its own base \u2013 that stopped the deal with its Stormont intervention and a later call between Arlene Foster and Mrs May. Monday may have been the moment when Mrs May\u2019s Brexit strategy came off the rails. She and her ministers have consistently pretended that the Brexit process is simpler and easier than it actually is. They have done this, above all, to keep the government together and to retain political ownership of Brexit for the Conservative party. At the root of this deception are the massive realities that the EU is by far the UK\u2019s most important trading partner and that the single market and customs union are arrangements that benefit Britain. Mrs May\u2019s insistence that the Brexit vote in 2016 means the UK must leave them both, if necessary on WTO terms, is a false and reckless choice. It puts Brexit utterly at odds with our national economic self-interest, as well as being an act of unprovoked economic hostility against Ireland, with dangerous implications on both sides of the Irish border. As the moment of truth in the negotiations has neared, Mrs May has made sensible and belated concessions to reality that alarm the anti-European fanatics in her party and the press. She has shifted on the transition period, on the money and, it began to appear on Monday, on Ireland. She has always said that she wants a frictionless border and to uphold the Good Friday agreement, rightly in both cases. But a frictionless border requires either that the UK stays in the customs union, which Mrs May has rejected, or that Northern Ireland stays in it while mainland Britain leaves, which the DUP won\u2019t allow and which triggers similar demands from Scotland, Wales and London. One of these approaches will have to give. In the Guardian\u2019s view, Britain should stay in the customs union or guarantee to shadow its regulations. Mrs May still prefers to look for a fudge. Monday\u2019s language about \u201ccontinued regulatory alignment\u201d between Northern Ireland and the EU was an attempt to find a square-circling form of words. But if Mrs May had been more flexible about Brexit and had not made her abject pact with the DUP after the general election, she would have got a deal on Monday. That is what most people in these islands want. It is profoundly in both national interests that there is no hard border in Ireland. But it is equally important that Britain stays in the customs union. The DUP must not be allowed to veto either issue."
"7||The Guardian view on Green Toryism: it must go beyond gimmicksTories should be capable of looking like reliable stewards of the environment. Conservation and conservatism are obviously related. Yet a passion for green issues is a fairly reliable indicator of a voter\u2019s aversion to backing Theresa May at the last election. MPs have been taken aback by the ferocity of reaction to reports that Conservatives had voted against recognising sentience in animals last month. Impassioned rebuttals could not hold back the tide of anger. It expressed a suspicion that animal cruelty was just the sort of thing one might expect from a Conservative \u2013 even if the facts were garbled. Downing Street has been spooked by that episode, which reinforces polling evidence that Tories are seen as uncaring. Mrs May had, after all, pleged a free vote on foxhunting in the manifesto. Contempt for the natural world is an emblem of their supposed callousness. So MPs have been briefed by Gavin Barwell, Mrs May\u2019s chief of staff, that care for the environment is to be the unifying principle across a range of policies designed to rehabilitate the party\u2019s reputation. This is hardly a new problem. David Cameron memorably invited the public to \u201cvote blue, go green\u201d. The limits of that message were clear even then. An episode commonly recalled from that era was the story of Mr Cameron cycling to the Commons, followed by a car bearing a change of clothes. The eco-conversion was superficial and seen as such. Once the Tories had captured No 10, the greenery was abandoned. Attempts to revive it now are led by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, who was once a cheerleader for \u201cmodernisation\u201d under Mr Cameron. Mr Gove has backed a ban on pesticides that harm bees , mooted a new domestic authority to compensate for the loss of European environmental regulation after Brexit and pledged to tackle plastic waste. It is easy to dismiss these as symbolic gestures by an ambitious politician raising his profile. But Mr Gove is a tenacious minister, so whatever his motives, it is good for the environmental cause that he has decided to make it his personal hobbyhorse. Yet when it comes to rehabilitating the Tory image, the obstacles will not be cleared by one minister wielding a handful of initiatives. Mrs May has shown little interest in green matters. Much more problematic is the Tories\u2019 financial dependence on big corporate donors, who expect regulator favours for their munificence. Supporting business and keeping the planet safe do not have to be mutually exclusive goals, but there are trade-offs that many Conservatives find uncomfortable. It does not help that the right wing of the party wears an ideological streak of climate-change denial. Mr Gove\u2019s eco-friendly interventions cannot obscure a controversial record of voting against measures to halt global warming. There is an honourable Tory tradition of environmentalism. Margaret Thatcher was instrumental in international action to ban the CFCs that damaged the ozone layer. A strain of conservative philosophy is appalled by the vandalism of the natural world caused by human recklessness and arrogance. Yet those tendencies have, in recent decades, been subordinate to a more rapacious, ultra-free-market variant of Conservative ideology. If the Tories want their caring credentials to be taken seriously they should go beyond presentational gimmicks and forage a little deeper in their party\u2019s intellectual roots."
"8||Brexit Ireland deal could leave PM at odds with three demanding groupsTheresa May\u2019s decision to concede the need to maintain \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit leaves her with several powerful interest groups to placate. How are they likely to respond, and what can the prime minister do to keep them on board? Northern Ireland unionists Even if the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) really wanted to take a risk and embrace a UK-EU deal that kept Northern Ireland in the same trade and regulations regime as the rest of Europe, it would face attack on its own flank. Its rivals both in the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice and the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) would immediately accuse the DUP of a \u201csell-out\u201d. The most strident attack on the \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d proposal came from the UUP as opposed to the DUP. Robin Swann, the Ulster Unionist leader, said that if the draft document was the real deal, then this would \u201cpresent serious challenges to the economic, constitutional and political integrity of the United Kingdom\u201d. The DUP high command shares that analysis, which means it is not going to be persuaded to adopt this proposal in the draft leaked to Irish broadcaster RTE earlier on Monday. DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson has even warned that the party would would take the \u201cSamson option\u201d and pull the parliamentary pillars down on top of itself by withdrawing support for the Conservatives. Sinn F\u00e9in argues that the DUP would be reluctant to bring down May because it might result in a general election that leads to Jeremy Corbyn and Labour taking power. With that in mind, DUP sources have said the party will instead be making common cause with Eurospectic Tories on the Conservative backbenches who are equally suspicious of any \u201cspecial deal\u201d for one part of the UK. The DUP could then make double trouble for the prime minister \u2013 by not only threatening to withdraw its \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d arrangement that keeps May in Downing Street but also making common cause with the more strident anti-European Tories. Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent Brexiters and the Tory right Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and other leading Eurosceptics will not be happy if the UK ends up bound by existing EU regulations because Theresa May has agreed to align Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland to avoid a hard border. This is the worst-case scenario for them and tantamount to the UK remaining in the single market, which they view as hardly leaving the EU at all. More than a dozen Conservative MPs would probably reject a Brexit deal if these were the terms. If Gove and Johnson were to be unhappy, they could even bring down May\u2019s government. Any suggestion that London has simply capitulated to Dublin and Brussels will also not play well with Tory Eurosceptic backbenchers. But despite the claims of Nicola Sturgeon, Carwyn Jones and Sadiq Khan, it is not at all clear that this is what May has done with her offer. The UK appears to be talking about signing up to \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d but only if there are \u201cno other agreed solutions\u201d and only in areas which support \u201cnorth-south cooperation\u201d and \u201cthe protection of the Good Friday agreement\u201d. Brexit-supporting MPs are more likely to accept this option, as they could probably tolerate sticking to EU rules in some very specific trading areas, such as pork and milk. So for now, the Tory awkward squad will wait to hear news of a final idea before passing judgment. The most outraged reaction on the right came from Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, who said the \u201cbitter betrayal of 17.4 million people today is a concession too far, for it will lead to endless problems in Scotland and it damages the integrity of the UK\u201d. But he no longer leads a political party and has never had a seat in parliament. Rowena Mason, deputy political editor Scotland and the SNP Nicola Sturgeon suspects her government may be on the cusp of a breakthrough moment on Brexit, one where she sees Scotland\u2019s case for special access to the EU single market and its customs union as undeniable. Sturgeon said in a statement on Monday that an open borders deal with Ireland would put Scotland \u201cat a double disadvantage\u201d on jobs and investment, by boosting Northern Ireland\u2019s trade and business links at the expense of other parts of the UK. The Scottish first minister believes Theresa May\u2019s stance on Brexit is about to collapse under the weight of its contradictions. If Northern Ireland is allowed to remain closely aligned to EU single market rules to protect trade with Ireland, why, she asked in a tweet, can Scotland not do so too? Sturgeon\u2019s stance is underpinned by a wide consensus in Scotland that preserving the closest possible economic ties with the EU is the most desirable Brexit deal. However, Sturgeon has had a miserable experience galvanising Scottish public opinion on Brexit this year because she linked it explicitly to independence: the Scottish National party lost 21 Westminster seats in June. Now she senses an opportunity to rebuild popular support on Brexit, and present the Conservatives and British government with a nasty dilemma. Sturgeon still has 35 MPs; the SNP remains the third largest party in the Commons. Although an Irish deal would aim to protect the Good Friday peace agreement, which encodes pan-Ireland cooperation, rejecting Scotland\u2019s claims to the same privileges or the right to single issue concessions will fuel Scottish complaints that the Tories have no mandate to enforce a harder line for Scotland. And an Irish open border deal adds logic, Sturgeon will argue, to her case for Scottish independence after Brexit. If an UK-Irish frontier can be open, why not an Anglo-Scottish one? Survation\u2019s new poll puts support for independence at 47%, the highest for some time. Sturgeon may now have more ammunition to link the two. Severin Carrell, Scotland editor"
"10||Little surprise that inequality gets worse under the ToriesThe resignation of Alan Milburn and the other members of the Social Mobility Commission on the grounds that the government\u2019s \u201crhetoric of healing social divisions [is not] matched with the reality\u201d suggests naivety (Never mind social mobility. Poverty is an insult to us all, 4 December). We could fill a library with the accumulated evidence of the spectrum of inequalities published since 1960. The critical question is why these have only resulted in, at most, incremental rather than substantive changes. The depressing narrative is that successive governments have introduced a wide range of social and economic policies, many reinforcing the belief that individuals are responsible for their own destiny. The \u201csuccess\u201d of these policies is reflected in electoral support for inequality, including how the most vulnerable often blame themselves for failing to manage. This is an opportunity for Labour not only to reinforce its commitment to abolish poverty, as Zoe Williams suggests, but also to address inequality in all its manifestations and offer the electorate a comprehensive programme to achieve this. Prof Mike Stein University of York \u2022 One doesn\u2019t need to be left of the \u201cfar-centre of an opposition\u201d, as Zoe Williams claims, to find \u201c[Theresa] May\u2019s equality shtick rather hard to swallow\u201d, as the prime minister\u2019s repeated failures to act on any one of her aims regarding \u201cburning injustices\u201d stated in her Downing Street speech lead to an all too obvious conclusion. Williams is right to say that support for the Child Poverty Act was \u201conly skin deep\u201d but, sadly, the same is true of all recent Tory announcements on social improvement. Giving priority to policies of austerity, tax reduction and state-shrinking means everything else becomes mere rhetoric, designed only to win votes. The Social Justice and Mobility Commission was never intended to have the power to initiate change; after all, giving more opportunities to people from working-class backgrounds inevitably means less opportunities for the middle and upper classes. Having the EU as a scapegoat, deflecting blame from the government for the poverty and minimal opportunities for improvement, came in handy for the dominant faction in government, leaving us with an ever worsening problem. Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022 My only question for Alan Milburn is what took them so long. Commissions of this kind are too often a device for appearing to take action while doing the exact opposite. The government knows perfectly well what the problems are, and only needs to refer to the Labour party\u2019s manifesto to start finding solutions. Until people are paid enough to live on without the state subsidising employers, private landlords etc through the benefit system and giving tax breaks to an already wealthy elite, we will continue to have endless debates about social inequality, child poverty and deprivation. Those enjoying affluent and privileged positions are not there by accident or natural selection. Karen Barratt Winchester \u2022 Theresa May has the perfect opportunity to \u201cbequeath a society that truly works for the many and not the few\u201d by bringing into force the socioeconomic duty (section 1 of the Equality Act). This essentially requires effective and transparent policies to tackle socioeconomic inequality. \u201cWhen making decisions of a strategic nature about how to exercise [their] functions, [public authorities must] have due regard to the desirability of exercising them in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome which result from socioeconomic disadvantage.\u201d Had it been in force, the government would have had to consider the likely impact of tax, social security and public spending reforms before implementing them. It would have had to show that these measures were the best of all the possible alternatives, and that they were not going to result in discriminatory outcomes and increasing inequality. Scotland will bring this duty to life in December and councils such as Newcastle, Leicester, Islington, Newham and Southwark are taking it into account in their plans to avoid tragedies such as the Grenfell Tower deaths. A few days ago Harriet Harman tabled an early day motion calling on the government to bring the socioeconomic duty to life, and 39 MPs have already expressed their support. If we want to tackle the UK\u2019s extraordinarily high levels of inequality, then bringing the socioeconomic duty into force is vital. Dr Wanda Wyporska Executive director, The Equality Trust Dr Koldo Casla Policy director, Just Fair \u2022 What the government does is more important than what it says it intends to do (Ministers deny giving up on fairer Britain, 4 December), whether considering domestic social policy or our relations with the EU. Despite the recent powerful report from the Social Mobility Commission, ringing the changes so that the top two posts are not held by former cabinet ministers may be just the kind of development that Alan Milburn and Gillian Shephard would in most other circumstances recognise as positive and progressive. Les Bright Exeter, Devon \u2022 The resignation of Alan Milburn\u2019s team uncannily echoes the situation last August when Donald Trump abandoned his advisory panel on business after a rash of top CEOs had already voluntarily departed. The reasons that the two groups of experts walked away are ostensibly different. In the UK it\u2019s in protest at the amount of energy that is going on Brexit to the exclusion of doing enough about inequality. In the US it was a statement against Mr Trump\u2019s dubious comments around violence at a white nationalist rally at Charlottesville. But perhaps they have more in common than meets the eye? In the \u201cpost-truth\u201d era why bother at all with advisers when all the major decisions have already been made at a biased and partisan political level? And when events cannot be influenced by anything so inconvenient and prosaic as previously stated aims, the facts or the public good? A British government spokesperson suggested that Milburn\u2019s decision to leave had come only after he found out that he would have to compete for his own position if he wanted to continue in it. But what about all the others who resigned with him? Instead of slinging mud at departing members, maybe it would be more honest if Theresa May closed down the Social Mobility Commission altogether. Joe McCarthy Dublin \u2022 The severe reduction in numbers of public sector jobs may be a contributing factor impeding social mobility (I benefited from social mobility, and I still feel like a permanent outsider, G2, 30 November). The assault on the public services has not just been in terms of numbers, but also demoralisation through overwork, reduced pay and status, targets, and testing. People from poorer communities who have achieved higher education, and maybe professional training, may want to keep close ties with their families and friends while showing they are doing a worthwhile job and feeling they are repaying society for the benefits they have received. Not everyone wants to use higher education to transform themselves into an extra from Brideshead Revisited in order to get a job making profits for an American bank, or contributing to the success of a company that transfers its assets offshore to avoid paying tax. Austerity has destroyed useful rungs in the social mobility ladder. Cutbacks in legal aid have destroyed rafts of solicitors\u2019 and barristers\u2019 jobs, the probation service has lost jobs, GPs are vastly overworked, university lecturers are impoverished and undermined by zero-hours contracts, teachers are bogged down in paperwork, nurses sometimes have to rely on food banks, social workers are blamed for everything, the police are treated as enemies by the government, the military are facing yet more cuts. We need public services that are publicly owned, with good secure pensionable jobs and career progression, spread across the whole country. If the government provides the jobs, young people with good qualifications from disadvantaged backgrounds will aspire to do them.

"14||Home Office\u2019s shameful treatment of long-settled UK residentsThe Home Office\u2019s treatment of Anthony Bryan (On notice to be deported after lifetime in Britain, 2 December) and many other vulnerable long-term residents in the UK is shameful, but it is not limited to the disadvantaged. I am white, middle class, and have lived in the UK for all of my adult life. I am privileged in every way apart from having been born in the US. In 1996 I was granted a certificate of naturalisation on the grounds that I had been married to an Englishman for 30 years. And yet when I tried to renew my British passport in November 2016 I was refused on the grounds that the name on my American passport is Sheila Haynes Hale, while my expiring British passport has just Sheila Hale. I was told that to qualify for a renewed UK passport I must prove my identity with a recent utility bill or bank statement showing the name Sheila Haynes Hale. Since I had not used my full name in this country for many decades this proved impossible. The bank wouldn\u2019t change my name without a utility bill and vice versa. I returned to the passport office with my certificate of naturalisation and my will, drawn up by a solicitor who had insisted that it should carry all three names. Again I was refused the renewal: it must be a utility bill or a bank statement. The certificate of naturalisation was apparently no longer valid. On my third visit to the passport office I appended a note to the documentation saying that the reason I did not use a middle name in this country was that my husband had been knighted in 1984. Since it was his title, not mine, I could not, according to the custom of this country, be \u201cLady Haynes Hale\u201d. I was on my way home when I received a text: \u201cDear Lady Hale, your passport will be sent by special delivery within the next few days.\u201d It arrived the following morning. Sheila Hale Twickenham \u2022 Congratulations for your reporting on the rising numbers of innocent people being persecuted by the Home Office. As the numbers involved cannot contribute hugely to the stupid immigration targets, this must be interpreted as a dog whistle. Is there a Home Office team going through everyone who came here before 1971 in case they have lost their records so they can be arbitrarily be thrown out? I have a Ugandan Asian friend, by the way, who says he no longer swims in the sea in case they won\u2019t let him back in. David Quinn London \u2022 My heart goes out to the Jamaicans and others who have lived in the UK legally since they were children in the 1960s, now being threatened with deportation by our bigoted government. There but for the grace of (my being American and white). I arrived in 1967 to marry a Brit. Americans didn\u2019t recognise dual citizenship, so I opted for \u201cindefinite leave to remain\u201d instead of taking British nationality. The US recognised dual nationality years ago, but I only got round to applying for naturalisation recently after I realised it wasn\u2019t sensible to trust this government one inch. What if I protested against fracking, was arrested and got a criminal record? Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan resident with a British partner and children, was deported for a similar reason \u2013 and died on the plane after being restrained by security guards in 2010. Now it seems that even a clear record isn\u2019t enough. The government should regularise these blameless people who came as children to the UK \u2013 not terrorise them, put them in detention and deport them. This government\u2019s hostile attitude is monstrous. I was granted British citizenship with no difficulty. I am not proud to feel ashamed of both my \u201cmother\u201d countries.

"15||We can\u2019t trust MPs to look after the Houses of ParliamentCharlotte Higgins has nailed the dilemma of the Palace of Westminster (The Houses of Parliament are falling down, 2 December). Politicians are the last people who should be managing such a complex and precious estate on their own. Those who oversaw Augustus Pugin and Charles Barry, as they struggled to build the thing in the 19th century, have been described as \u201cprobably the worst clients in Britain\u201d, and their successors have ever since strived to live up to that dictum. But the palace is nonetheless valuable, as a work of art, a symbol and a location with a richer, and more enriching, history than any other in the UK. We should encourage parliament to know that making the building safe, accessible and sustainable, while restoring and respecting its architectural heritage, is a project of international significance that, done well, would display courage and vision and earn the nation\u2019s respect. Sadly, proceedings in Westminster Hall are not encouraging. The roof is being fixed, but historians and archaeologists have been excluded from the project, with a baseless argument about cost. Without archaeologists on board, one of the great wonders of the medieval world \u2013 and the greatest treasure in this world heritage site \u2013 is at risk of compromise. We have asked, but have been given no convincing reasons for this situation. It seems parliament lags far behind the country\u2019s appreciation of our heritage. Mike Pitts Editor, British Archaeology \u2022 In addition to the many issues raised by Charlotte Higgins\u2019 excellent article, we must hope that lessons have been learned from the unfortunate experience at Westminster Hall. The finest medieval roof in the world is to be cleaned and repaired, and the erection of scaffolding provides a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a thorough archaeological investigation. This should include an examination of how the roof was erected and dendrochronological dating. Moreover, the carved angels on the roof and their shields were almost certainly painted, and need to be expertly examined for traces of paint which may be destroyed in the cleaning process. The hall roof fiasco must make everyone worry about what might happen when the far larger restoration and renewal project happens. Tim Tatton-Brown Consultant archaeologist, Salisbury \u2022 The Palace of Westminster is not fit for purpose. Here\u2019s the solution. Sell the whole lot off to a developer; after making sufficient repairs for safety it can be opened as a highly profitable tourist attraction. Build the new Houses of Parliament at the centre of Great Britain (round about Skipton, North Yorkshire, I think). A modern complex would provide comfortable accommodation and services for MPs (no more expenses for second homes). The parliament buildings themselves would be circular, encouraging constructive debate. We should take this opportunity to abolish political parties. Constituents could then elect their MPs on the basis of their credentials rather than feeling obliged to support sleazy or corrupt individuals just because they represent the favoured party.

"14||Putting the UK transport system back on trackWhile Sustrans welcomes the potential reopening of disused railway lines in principle (Beeching\u2019s axed rail lines could be revived, 29 November), it will be critical that the many walking and cycling routes that have been built along some of these lines are also maintained. These routes are a critical part of the country\u2019s active travel infrastructure and strategy, encouraging people to walk and cycle in a safe environment, as well as providing important commuting access for people choosing to travel actively to work. Every year an estimated five million people use the National Cycle Network. These trips save the UK economy over \u00a3550m each year by reducing levels of obesity; of this \u00a375m is saved from the NHS budget. Xavier Brice CEO, Sustrans (the guardian of the National Cycle Network) \u2022 You quote the transport secretary, Chris Grayling: \u201cWe need to expand [the rail network] to unlock jobs and housing growth across the country\u201d.

"4||Pope shines as Trump fails test of leadership on migrants and refugeesDonald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the UN global compacts on migration and refugees (Report, 4 December) is the latest example of the president\u2019s abdication of leadership on a defining issue of our time. It is to be hoped that other leaders respond by redoubling efforts, as they did when Mr Trump announced the US\u2019s abandonment of the Paris agreement. The international community should look to another head of state, Pope Francis, for an example of true leadership. He has made clear that the unprecedented movement of people worldwide constitutes a global phenomenon. As such, it requires a global response, not the renunciation of responsibility. This message will be echoed in the Holy See\u2019s contribution to discussions taking place this week in Mexico. The pope has called our response to the plight faced by displaced people \u201ca test of our humanity\u201d. It is a test other leaders must not fail.

"7||Hard Brexiters have just discovered Britain is weaker than IrelandThere may be some way to go, but today we moved much closer to a British climbdown on the question of the Irish border after Brexit. And this will turn an acrimonious debate on its head. So far, we\u2019ve been talking about the implications of Brexit for Ireland. Now we have to talk about the implications of Ireland for Brexit. It is not just that Britain\u2019s weakness in its negotiations with the European Union has been made even more starkly clear. On the three issues on which \u201csufficient progress\u201d had to be made \u2013 people, money and Ireland \u2013 Britain seems likely to suffer a hat-trick of defeats. Its concessions in the talks on the border issue are not yet official, and may seem more abstract and less visceral than its retreats on the divorce bill and the rights of EU citizens in the UK; but they may prove to be much more fundamental and much more problematic for the whole Brexit project. There is a sense here of the return of the repressed: the Brexiters pretended Ireland did not exist; now it has come back to haunt their grand schemes. It is hard to think of a more boring phrase than the key one in the draft agreement between the UK and the EU: \u201ccontinued regulatory alignment\u201d on the island of Ireland. Yet within this technocratic formulation there lie all the things that Brexit\u2019s true believers should have been worrying about if they were not so busy patronising Ireland with cheery and meaningless reassurances about not returning to the borders of the past. It means, in essence, that Northern Ireland will at a minimum have to behave as if it is still in the customs union after Brexit. This may or not be explicitly stated in the final deal, but it is now the unavoidable destination of this process. You can\u2019t have regulatory alignment if you\u2019re in different customs regimes. Thus, even before the trade talks begin, the Brexit promised by Theresa May \u2013 a clean break for all the UK from the customs union and single market \u2013 is almost certainly off the table. Hard Brexiters always feared that the Irish border might be a Trojan horse entering the citadel of their pure certitude. The wooden horse is now well and truly inside the gates, even if it has not yet been opened. The first thing to note about the draft agreement is that Northern Ireland is, after all, not Yorkshire or Sussex. The line from the British government has, until now, been that of its allies in the Democratic Unionist party, whose leader, Arlene Foster, continues to insist that \u201cNorthern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom\u201d. The DUP, from its own point of view, is right to be deeply alarmed by what is unfolding \u2013 if this is indeed the deal, the DUP will have suffered a historic defeat. What is now on the table is a concession that, whatever else happens, Northern Ireland will in effect stay in the same customs and regulatory regime as the Republic of Ireland, which is of course the same as that of the EU as a whole. So Brexit doesn\u2019t quite mean Brexit after all \u2013 it has become complex and ambiguous. The apparent success of the Irish insistence on getting real commitments to the avoidance of a hard border means Northern Ireland will exit Europe through a different door. And this raises, for people in Britain, a rather more explosive question. It is no longer whether Northern Ireland will leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK. It is whether the rest of the UK will now leave the EU on the same terms as Northern Ireland. Given what seems to have been conceded, there is only one way for Northern Ireland not to have a special status \u2013 and that is for all the UK to remain in the customs union. The hard Brexiters like to see themselves also as hard unionists. But these two positions have just become radically incompatible. There are just two possible outcomes. If Northern Ireland in effect stays in the customs union and Britain leaves, then there will have to be an internal UK customs border, checking goods moving between Northern Ireland and British ports. This undoubtedly weakens the union. But the only way to avoid this is for the UK as a whole to stay in the customs union \u2013 which of course the true believers don\u2019t want either. For the moment, this hard choice will be evaded with rhetorical promises that the eventual trade deal between Britain and the EU will be so frictionless and painless that borders won\u2019t matter anyway \u2013 except, of course, for all the migrants who have to be kept out. But if we did not know already that this is fantasy, we know it now. The climbdown we are seeing on all three of the preliminary negotiating issues surely ends the illusions of all but the most deluded fanatics about Britain\u2019s real position in the Brexit process. It is not in a position to make demands \u2013 certainly not demands that the EU destroy its whole raison d\u2019etre by allowing a member state to leave the single market but still enjoy all its advantages. It was always stupid to turn the border issue into a face-off between mighty Britain and little Ireland. But that\u2019s how the hard Brexiters and their Tory press allies chose to construe it. Having done so, they might now ask themselves: if, for the first time in 800 years, Ireland is proving to be in a much stronger political position than Britain, what does that say about what Brexit is doing to Britain\u2019s strength? It is being forced to accept what it claimed to be unacceptable, not because Ireland has suddenly become a global superpower but because it has the unflinching support of EU member states, the European parliament, and the EU negotiating team. There might be a lesson in there somewhere for a country facing a future without the allies it has long taken for granted. \u2022 Fintan O\u2019Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times"

"6||Rio Tinto changes its designated driverCongratulations, Simon Thompson, current non-executive director of Rio Tinto, you are deemed sufficiently safe to step up to the chairmanship. The world\u2019s second biggest mining company didn\u2019t describe the appointment in this way, of course \u2013 but nor did it refer to the extraordinary behind-the-scenes lobbying that killed the hopes of the board\u2019s original preferred candidate, Sir Mick Davis. It was already known that the process had been hijacked by big shareholders, who had written to Rio to say they weren\u2019t keen on Davis, the former boss of Xstrata and the current chairman of the Conservative party. But the blistering tone of the now-leaked letter is worth noting. It is hard to recall a similar instance of a board of a large FTSE 100 company being read the riot act over the appointment of a chairman. Here\u2019s an extract: Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Investor Forum, which represents big fund management groups, said he was relating the views of 13 shareholders representing 20% of the London investor base and wrote on 21 November: \u201cWhile these long-term shareholders are supportive of the company and its operational strategy, given the challenges facing the organisation, they are of the strong opinion that the individual currently being identified in the media as a potential chairman is not an acceptable candidate. \u201cThe clear position of these shareholders would suggest that the company should expect a very hostile audience should it choose to pursue this course of action.\u201d Davis\u2019s business career has always divided opinion. Some fund managers applaud the deal-making that built Xstrata into a $50bn company at the moment he was taken over by Glencore. Others can\u2019t stomach the personal rewards for Xstrata\u2019s top brass, including the \u00a3140m retention package that executives were offered to stay after the takeover. But, remember, Davis had been interviewed and picked by the board of Rio as the frontrunner. A U-turn in these circumstances is unusual. A welcome victory for shareholder power? Up to a point. Almost everybody is in favour of big investors engaging actively with companies and, in this case, there\u2019s a fair argument that Rio doesn\u2019t need a swashbuckling, deal-making chairman at a moment when it is preaching a gospel of disciplined capital allocation. That, as it happens, was this column\u2019s view a few weeks ago. But, in Davis\u2019s shoes, you would also want to know why the Investor Forum mentioned \u201chigh personal integrity\u201d as one of three \u201ckey investor considerations for this appointment\u201d. That could be read as a general comment. But, in the context of the letter, it could also be taken as personal, nasty and below the belt. Davis, a well-known philanthropist, is entitled to an explanation. Stock market highs are just a sugar rush Another day, another record for Wall Street, and another chance for Donald Trump to spin the shallow idea that his presidency must be successful because stock prices are rising. The notion is shallow because cutting corporate taxes \u2013 and thereby delivering an instant boost to companies\u2019 earnings \u2013 was always likely to push the stock market higher. The process is almost mechanical, especially for big US-focused companies such as banks and energy companies. But, once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Workers on boards? How about a non-executive director? Let\u2019s recall, one last time, that ground-breaking pledge made by Theresa May in her brief period as a corporate reformer: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.\u201d In the latest proposed tweaks to the corporate governance code, there\u2019s no sign of either consumers or workers being installed on the boards of public companies. Taking its cue from the government\u2019s green paper, the Financial Reporting Council says companies can take their pick from one of three options. They can indeed nominate an employee to serve on the board. Or they can create an employee advisory council, if they don\u2019t have one already. Or they can just assign a non-executive director to look out for employees\u2019 interests. This third option is known as kicking the issue into the long grass. It will be popular."
"6||Wall Street sets record highs after passage of Donald Trump's tax cutsShares on Wall Street have hit record levels as financial markets around the world anticipate the biggest package of US tax cuts since Ronald Reagan was in the White House in the 1980s. Investors bought heavily into US stocks after Donald Trump received approval from the Senate for reforms that offer the biggest reduction in taxes to corporations and those on high incomes. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 hit record levels in early trading but later fell back because of a sell-off of technology stocks, which have seen substantial price rises this year. But there was heavy buying of telecom, bank, financial and other shares in sectors seen as benefiting from the tax cuts \u2013 the centrepiece of Trump\u2019s economic strategy. The technology sector is expected to benefit less because it already enjoys low tax rates. Although the final details of the package have still to be finalised through an agreement between the Senate and the House of Representatives, Wall Street believes that the president has finally succeeded in a near year-long battle to get Congress to support his plan. The Dow Jones closed just 58 points up, while the S&amp;P 500 was 0.1% down. The latter has risen about 18% since the start of the year on strong corporate earnings, economic growth and confidence that Trump would eventually get his tax cuts. Markets have shrugged off concerns that the cuts, like those in the 1980s, will lead to a ballooning of the US budget deficit. Mickey Levy, chief US economist at Berenberg, said he had revised up his growth forecasts for the world\u2019s biggest economy to 2.9% in 2018 and to 2.7% in 2019 as a result of the likely boost from the tax cuts. \u201cThe US Senate\u2019s narrow passage of its version of tax reform suggests strongly that the House and Senate will compromise their differences and tax legislation will be enacted by yearend 2017. \u201cWe expect the accelerated tax overhaul to add to the current positive momentum in the economy. The tax legislation includes some key provisions that are expected to have positive sustained impacts, lifting potential growth moderately, and fiscal stimulus through higher deficit spending that will provide a temporary boost to growth in 2018\u20132019 that will fade. The starting point for our forecast is very elevated levels of business and consumer confidence,\u201d Levy added. James Knightley, chief international analyst at ING bank, said the tax cuts would provide a fillip to US growth but added that a degree of scepticism was warranted. Knightley said the main beneficiaries of the personal tax cuts would be the top 1%, since the threshold for paying the top rate of income tax would more than double to $1m a year. Trump is proposing a cut in corporation tax from 35% to 20%. The cut could encourage US corporations to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars in profits they have stockpiled overseas rather than lose a large slice of them to the US tax authorities. Five big US tech companies \u2013 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Facebook \u2013 alone hold some $450bn overseas. However, Knightley said the effective rate paid by most companies was significantly lower than 35%, due to exemptions and credits. \u201cIn terms of the boost from income tax cuts, the Tax Policy Centre estimates that the top 1% of taxpayers would get 21% of the benefit in 2018 and 50% by 2027,\u201dKnightley said. \u201cWhile people on lower incomes would also on average see a positive impact on their finance,s this all suggest that the boost to consumer spending may not be great.\u201d On the currency markets, the pound lost all its early gains as it became clear that there had not been a decisive breakthrough in the Brexit talks. Sterling rose to just over $1.35 amid rumours that agreement had been reached over the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, but closed just above $1.345."
"17||Dorothy Cross: Glance review \u2013 life and death in a sorcerer's workshopTwo bronze fingers turn slowly on an old pair of scales. Like everything else in Glance, Irish artist Dorothy Cross\u2019s new show at Roche Court sculpture park, digits hang in the balance. Life offsets death, the cosmic is pitted against the terrestrial, the supernatural shines in something as basic and bodily as a ring of soap scum around a bath. In fact, the grease that once lined the massive, thickly rusted tub, salvaged by the artist and placed here on the flagstone floor of the old orangery, has been preserved as powdered gold, the mysterious residue of unknown lives. The whole show is an exercise in opposites, with the promise of transformation. Outside, on the lawn above fields of gently munching cattle, is another solid vestige of existence. A rumpled bed with a dented pillow \u2013 site of birth, death, sex and dreams \u2013 has been carved from a block of Carrara marble, a substance once reserved for depicting saints. Cross has performed an impressive resurrection on this material, favoured by renaissance sculptors and now the stuff of pricey kitchen countertops. This has as much to do with her switch of register, from the sacred to the secular, as the sculpture\u2019s placement within the exhibition\u2019s wider cosmos, a five-tonne counterpoint to works where everything seems airy and fleeting. The weight of marble, cut from deep within the earth, is offset by the lightness of a series of mobiles. Bathed in watery, winter light, these hang behind the glass wall of the gallery that joins the orangery with the 18th-century house (like \u201ca transparent bladder\u201d according to Cross). Two feature old brass telescopes aimed not at distant shores or the stars, but the inside of our heads \u2013 quite literally. Their lens point straight down towards fragments of human skull, the smooth bone outers a dull grey, the scored interiors gilded. One skull contains a pebble-sized piece of meteorite in a deft evocation of the celestial and the earthbound, the inner and outer space the artist navigates. What galaxy did this piece of dead star illuminate? The being that once occupied this fragile bone shell is gone, but where? With her mix of cast-offs, remains and precious metals, Cross clearly courts the now much overused notion of the artist-as-alchemist, \u201cmaking the simple valuable\u201d as she once put it. With their scales and stones, skulls and telescopes, her mobiles could be apparatus from a medieval sorcerer-scientist\u2019s workshop, where art, magic and science melt into one. Some of her most impressive transformations, though, are as much to do with ideas as they are materials. She has a genius for breathing new life into visual cliches. The half-gold skull, for instance, is a long way from Damien Hirst\u2019s diamond-encrusted memento mori with its brash satire on the art market. She manages to invest a sense of mystery into her fragments of cranium, hanging in the air so we must walk around them and peer inside to catch their inner surface. Seen in close-up in a photo-diptych, they are indistinguishable from leaves. Time \u2013 human and geological \u2013 has long been one of Cross\u2019s big concerns. She pits fleeting life against the bigger picture of existence. Suspended by near-invisible string, a bronze hand and foot in another mobile hang just above a moon-like disc of milky alabaster on the floor. Like the fingers on the scales, they conflate a cross-cultural range of symbols, suggestive of Catholic relics, witchcraft or the weighing of souls or the heart. They also hark back to our early evolution, a time when we walked with hands and feet. Traces of magic, religion, nature and science float through these works. In another photo-diptych, an altar in a decrepit Sicilian church is paired with a coral brain. The altar is empty, its icon long gone, and whatever religious scenes its wooden shell might once have displayed have dissolved to leave an abstraction of peeling paint. The coral brain on the other hand is an extraordinary object, created not by the hand of an artist, but mindless colonies of polyps. With the coral brain\u2019s 900-year lifespan, the Earth couldn\u2019t have fashioned a more pointed symbol of nature bettering man in longevity. Yet, even as Cross shows us bodies decaying, or belief systems evaporating, others take shape, from the tiny bird\u2019s egg nestled in a piece of cranium in a photograph to the fantastically gothic, bronze bog iris sprouting from a foetal skull. In her work, everything is in flux. Dorothy Cross: Glance is at New Art Centre until 11 February."
"18||Why Strictly Come Dancing romances aren't always 'cursed'The curse of Strictly Come Dancing is now a well-worn legend of reality TV. Beneath the dazzle and glitter is a rotting wasteland of discarded relationships \u2013 some splits apparently caused by the sheer bodily proximity to the dancers (see Kristina Rihanoff), and others caused by the celebrity realising the dance competition has injected new meaning into their life (see Louise Redknapp). Strictly is the Love Island for people who think they are above shows like that \u2013 they pretend they are here for the skill and the artistry, but what everyone really wants to know is who\u2019s getting off with who. And so this year, Strictly fans are getting invested in the supposed romance between popstar Mollie King and her partner, dancer AJ Pritchard. During Saturday\u2019s show, presenter Claudia Winkleman suggested the pair had spent half of their training time kissing, to the kind of hilarity and glee not seen for most people since the day after the school disco. Could this alleged relationship have been engineered by Strictly producers? \u201cI was single and they put me with the single guy!\u201d said actor Kara Tointon in 2015, after being paired with dancer Artem Chigvintsev (they dated between 2010 and 2014). \u201cI was so angry. I was determined we wouldn\u2019t get together and then of course you\u2019re spending so much time with this person and he was so wonderful \u2026 So yes, it was inevitable really.\u201d Dancer Flavia Cacace has said she thinks being on the show \u201csends the celebrities mad. Some people can\u2019t handle all that physical closeness. They fall in love with this dream, this fantasy. Our job is to make them feel the centre of attention. It\u2019s very addictive and it goes to some people\u2019s heads.\u201d But there have been a few enduring relationships so far. Countdown presenter Rachel Riley and her partner Pasha Kovalev are, to tabloid knowledge, still together. Rugby player Ben Cohen and his partner Rihanoff had a baby last year, and actor Jimi Mistry and his partner Cacace got married in 2013. Will Mollie and AJ last? Are they even together? Who cares? The answer, of course, is everybody \u2013 for there is currently no greater pressing issue in the world."
"19||Southampton University admits vice-chancellor was on pay panelA row over Southampton University\u2019s vice-chancellor\u2019s pay has escalated after the institution admitted he was on the committee that awarded him a pay package worth \u00a3433,000. Sir Christopher Snowden was placed in the spotlight last week after the resignation of the University of Bath\u2019s vice-chancellor, Glynis Breakwell, following widespread criticism of her \u00a3468,000 pay. On Friday, Southampton said Snowden\u2019s pay was \u201cset and is regularly reviewed and agreed\u201d by a remuneration committee, of which he was not a member. But university accounts show that the remuneration committee was only recently established, and Snowden\u2019s pay was actually set by a senior salaries committee, of which he was a member until 17 November. A Southampton University spokesman said that although Snowden sat on that committee, he was not present at meetings in which his pay was decided. The University and College Union (UCU) general secretary, Sally Hunt, said it was a familiar story. UCU research has found that more than two-thirds of vice-chancellors were on the committee that set their pay. \u201cWhile most people would agree this is wrong and looks suspect, it is currently the norm, which makes Southampton\u2019s efforts to try and obscure the fact that their vice-chancellor was on the committee that sets his \u00a3433,000 package really strange,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cFor the university to say the vice-chancellor\u2019s pay was set by a committee that didn\u2019t even exist when his pay was actually set will fill no one with confidence about its governance structures.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cThe apparent conflict of interests of so many vice-chancellors sitting on the committees that set their pay and perks risks the reputation of our universities at a time when too many students feel they don\u2019t get a fair deal. \u201cIf universities aren\u2019t releasing the full minutes of remuneration committees then they need to explain what justification there is for keeping them secret. There is a strong case for staff and students to be directly represented on such bodies.\u201d Lord Adonis, who has been a vocal critic of vice-chancellors\u2019 excessive pay, said: \u201cSir Christopher Snowden\u2019s position is untenable. He should either halve his pay or resign. \u201cPublic opinion won\u2019t tolerate vice-chancellors behaving as if they are medieval prince bishops. It is unfair and unjust to the students and poorly paid lecturers who are footing the bill. He is showing exactly the same defiance as the head of Bath University, who seemed to think she was worth every penny of an obscene salary.\u201d Southampton said a \u201cpost-Brexit strategy\u201d justified Snowden\u2019s pay. A university spokesman said: \u201cAt the start of the 2017-18 academic year, the university changed its senior salaries committee to a remuneration committee as part of the continual improvement of its corporate governance and in accordance with updated guidelines recently published by Hefce [the Higher Education Funding Council for England]. \u201cPreviously, the president and vice-chancellor was a member of this committee in order to contribute to discussions about pay for his own direct reports and executive team. The vice-chancellor was not present at any point during the meeting for discussions and voting on his own pay.\u201d The spokesman said Snowden was not a member of the new remuneration committee and attended \u201conly by invitation\u201d to participate in discussions relating to his direct reports and executive team. \u201cAs the vice-chancellor is only involved in discussing pay for his direct reports, he receives a suitably shortened version of the meeting papers. Minutes, past and present, clearly show the point at which the vice-chancellor leaves the meeting prior to any agenda items considering their own pay. As the vice-chancellor is not a member of the committee, he has no voting rights on the remuneration committee.\u201d The UCU has condemned Southampton University for spending \u00a31.5m in the last three years on vice-chancellor salaries and for trying to cut 75 academic jobs to save money while simultaneously advertising for a chauffeur. In June, Southampton was criticised by Jo Johnson, the universities minister, who has called on universities to restrain pay for senior management. \u201cThere is one institution on the south coast that has seen vice-chancellor pay rise from \u00a3227,000 in 2009-10 to \u00a3350,000 in 2015-16, which is really quite a sharp increase,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a Russell Group institution. It\u2019s a steep increase and I want to ensure that the students at that institution are getting the best experience, that they\u2019re getting the kind of teaching experience they deserve.\u201d On Monday, Southampton students\u2019 union said it was consulting with students who had come forward to express their concerns. \u201cWe are working with those students to gauge overall student opinion across our campuses, and the issue will be discussed further over the coming weeks,\u201d said the union\u2019s president, Flora Noble. \u201cOur priority right now is to represent students\u2019 academic interests by both working with and challenging the university in ensuring that students are not detrimentally affected during the current restructure.\u201d At Bath, where there were protests from students and staff, pay rises were also approved by a remuneration committee of which the vice-chancellor was a member. Johnson said: \u201cUniversities are autonomous when it comes to setting pay, but it\u2019s important this system commands public confidence and delivers value for money. This is why from next year the new Office for Students will expect transparency and accountability, with justifications required for exceptional levels of pay that exceed \u00a3150k.\u201d Alan Whitehead, the Labour MP for Southampton Test, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is appropriate, particularly when we are in a period of cuts and retrenchment in the higher education system, for any vice-chancellor to be paid more than \u00a3400,000pa and that obviously includes Southampton University.\u201d"
"7||Clean, green New Zealand is a lie \u2013 and a warning for Britain\u2019s countrysideThere can\u2019t be a more successful tourism marketing campaign than \u201c100% Pure New Zealand\u201d. And New Zealand is seen as a world leader in another respect: how its farmers sell their food globally without government subsidies. But the tension between these two successes has been exposed by Sir Tim Smit, the co-founder of the Eden Project in Cornwall. Smit has sparked a minor international incident by declaring that New Zealand is \u201cso pure the people of Christchurch won\u2019t even swim in the river Avon. Most of the lakes are full of algae. It is like a beautiful person with cancer.\u201d He was speaking to British landowners pondering the New Zealand model for post-Brexit agriculture. British farmers currently receive \u00a33bn in subsidies each year; environment secretary Michael Gove must design a much smaller subsidy system \u2013 or scrap it altogether. Smit argues that New Zealand is no inspiration despite its farmers surviving the removal of subsidies in 1984. Their response has been to intensify, and export milk to China. Landscapes that George Monbiot might describe as sheep-wrecked are now cattle-wrecked; the cost, argues Smit, is water quality, as nitrates from fertilisers flood into rivers. Smit\u2019s critique has been endorsed not only by Greenpeace New Zealand but also by the chief executive of New Zealand\u2019s fish and game council, Martin Taylor, who calls the country\u2019s clean, green image \u201ca facade\u201d. Brexit marks a crossroads for the British countryside. Gove believes we can boost agricultural productivity while also enhancing the environment. His vision isn\u2019t so dissimilar from some environmentalists\u2019: subsidy-dependent upland farming will cease (and some land even rewilded) while production is intensified on surviving lowland farms. But the idea that we can have it all \u2013 cheap food, pristine environments and profitable farmers \u2013 is naive. Without tough regulation and subsidies for farmers to provide public goods such as healthy soil, clean water and carbon storage, we will all, ultimately, suffer. No accounting for nature I suggested the Isle of Man could imitate New Zealand\u2019s \u201c100% Pure\u201d marketing when I visited last week. It was an answer to questions from islanders frustrated that their public image is of 83,000 accountants clinging to a low-tax rock in the Irish sea. I\u2019m always struck by Man\u2019s deliciously clean air, its variety of scenery, from moors to mountains to luminous green pasture, and the fact that the sea is always unexpectedly close. With superb marine nature reserves, the island offers excellent whale-watching; when its skies are clear (not often, in my limited experience) its lack of light pollution makes for superb star-gazing. Clean air, healthy seas, stars \u2013 these are our true riches. Unfortunately, it looks like post-Brexit Britain will seek to emulate Man\u2019s financial arrangements rather than its natural wealth. A mammoth mistake On Sunday a new BBC documentary will tell the tragic tale of Jumbo, the 19th-century circus elephant who gave his name to big jets. When Jumbo died in a collision with a train in Canada, his owner claimed Jumbo saved his keeper\u2019s life by deliberately facing down the train. In fact, scientists examining his skeleton have discovered, Jumbo was hit from behind: the maltreated elephant was running away. We may feel good that Britain\u2019s last circus elephant was taken into a sanctuary six years ago. But given elephants\u2019 size and what science is telling us about their sensitivity and intelligence, we shouldn\u2019t be keeping them in zoos at all. I\u2019ve no doubt that a 22nd-century documentary will upbraid us for that. \u2022 Patrick Barkham is a Guardian columnist"
"17||Winnie-the-Pooh heads to the V&A in London for bear-all exhibitionWinnie-the-Pooh had many exciting encounters with woozles, balloons, and irritable bees \u2013 but the one adventure his creators would never have dared suggest for the bear of very little brain is that, heading towards his 90th birthday, he would star in a large exhibition at the V&amp;A Museum in London. The exhibition will open this week featuring close to a century\u2019s worth of Winnie-the-Pooh merchandise, including toys, books of the wisdom of Pooh on subjects as arcane as Taoism and management theory, a Russian bear created by a designer who had clearly never seen the original, and a hand-painted Christopher Robin and Friends china tea set presented to the baby Princess Elizabeth in 1926 \u2013 either she did not like it and never played with it, or more probably was just a very careful child. The walls of the exhibition, the most comprehensive on some of the best-loved children\u2019s books of all time, are lined with scores of ink and pencil drawings of the characters and settings by EH Shepard. His first book illustrating AA Milne\u2019s deceptively simple stories about his son and his toys was published in 1926. Though the author had long since moved on to other subjects before his death in 1956, and the real Christopher Robin had come to loathe the books and worldwide fame that made him an involuntary celebrity, Shepard continued to draw the small inhabitants of Hundred Acre Wood, giving away scores of drawings and working on hand-coloured versions of the illustrations to within months of his death in 1976, aged 96. Dozens of his originals are in the V&amp;A collection but are so fragile they were last displayed almost 40 years ago. The show\u2019s curator, Annemarie Bilclough, attributes the longevity of the four books \u2013 runaway successes on publication and never out of print since \u2013 to the winning combination of Shepard\u2019s images and Milne\u2019s writing. \u201cThey are just so well-written, so humorous and so brilliantly characterised that they\u2019re a pleasure both for children to read, and for the adults who mainly buy the books, and often have to read them aloud over and over again. The characters are so well-drawn they are instantly recognisable \u2013 everyone knows an Eeyore.\u201d Although another illustrator worked on the first Winnie-the-Pooh story \u2013 a Christmas special printed by a newspaper in 1925 \u2013 Bilclough said that after the first book Milne knew he had the perfect partner in Shepard. He negotiated a 20% share of the royalties for Shepard, instead of the flat fee more common for illustrators. The drawings show the care Shepard took, producing vivid sketches of real trees in Ashdown Forest, where the Milnes had bought an old farmhouse, to get the setting absolutely right. The exhibition is designed by RFK architects and Tom Piper, the theatre designer who created the installation of thousands of ceramic poppies made by the artist Paul Cummins, which filled the moat of the Tower of London to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war. His design fills the galleries with spaces where parents will find it impossible to follow small visitors, including a narrow flight of steps leading to a slide, and Owl\u2019s tiny door with the brass bell labelled \u201cRNIG ALSO\u201d. Winnie-the-Pooh: Exploring a Classic will be at the V&amp;A Musuem in south-west London from 9 December 2017 until 8 April 2018. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 December 2017 because an earlier version didn\u2019t include RFK architects as designers of the exhibition."
"13||'Go get 'em, Roy': Trump backs accused child molester Moore for SenateDonald Trump has thrown his full support behind Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race, tweeting his endorsement before calling the controversial candidate to say: \u201cGo get \u2019em, Roy!\u201d Trump tweeted early on Monday: \u201cDemocrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!\u201d Referring again to the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, the president added: \u201cPutting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes, tough on crime, strong on military and borders...&amp; so much more.\u201d Moore has lost the backing of many top Republicans since the Washington Post first reported allegations of sexual misconduct with young women decades ago. Trump praised him in recent weeks but had not formally backed him. Several hours after his tweets, Trump called Moore. The call was announced by the Alabama Republican\u2019s wife on Facebook. \u201cJudge Moore just got off the phone with President Trump,\u201d Kayla Moore wrote. \u201cWe have his full support! Thank you Mr President! Let\u2019s MAGA!\u201d The Moore campaign confirmed to the Guardian that the conversation had taken place. In a follow-up statement, a spokesperson said: \u201cPresident Trump called Judge Moore a \u2018fighter\u2019 and expressed his eagerness to have Judge Moore fighting for his agenda in Washington. The president wrapped up the call with a \u2018Go get \u2019em, Roy!\u2019\u201d The White House later issued a statement in which a spokesman, Raj Shah, said: \u201cThe president had a positive call with Judge Roy Moore during which they discussed the state of the Alabama Senate race and the president endorsed Judge Moore\u2019s campaign.\u201d The White House has said the president has no plans to make campaign appearances with Moore but he has agreed to headline a campaign-style rally in Pensacola, Florida, less than 20 miles from the Alabama border, just four days before the vote. The special election, to fill the seat vacated by Trump\u2019s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, will take place on Tuesday 12 December. Trump supported Luther Strange, the appointed incumbent, in the primary but Strange was beaten by Moore, a controversial hardline conservative who had the backing of Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former senior White House strategist, who is mounting a challenge to the party establishment. Bannon is due to hold a rally with Moore on Tuesday. Moore has defied calls to step down over the allegations by a number of women, one of whom alleges he initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 and he was in his 30s. Moore denies all the allegations and said last week they were the result of a conspiracy that included \u201clesbians, gays, bisexuals and socialists\u201d. Even before the allegations, Moore was a controversial figure. He has suggested that \u201chomosexual conduct\u201d should be criminalized and was twice removed as chief justice of the Alabama supreme court for defying federal court orders. On Monday morning, he tweeted: \u201cThankful for President Trump\u2019s support. The America First agenda will #MAGA. Can\u2019t wait to help him #DrainTheSwamp.\u201d The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who has said he believes Moore\u2019s accusers, has now taken a slightly different position. \u201cI think that at this point, we\u2019re just going to let the people of Alabama make their decision,\u201d McConnell told the Associated Press on Sunday, adding that he believed the Senate ethics committee would take up an investigation if Moore were elected. \u201cThe ethics committee will have to consider the matters that have been litigated in the campaign should that particular candidate win,\u201d McConnell said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cAnd I\u2019m confident they\u2019ll come up with the right conclusion.\u201d However, some Republicans continued to express their outrage over Moore. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump critic, tweeted on Monday afternoon: \u201cRoy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity.\u201d Moore\u2019s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, is a prosecutor who helped to convict two Ku Klux Klan members over the 1963 bombing of an African American church in Birmingham in which four young girls were killed. Moore had fallen to level with or behind Jones in the deep red state, before, observers believe, sexual harassment allegations against the prominent Democrats John Conyers and Al Franken swayed the minds of some voters. The realclearpolitics.com polling average for the Alabama race now gives Moore a three-point lead."
"4||Ali Abdullah Saleh obituaryAli Abdullah Saleh, who has been killed aged 75, held power in Yemen for almost 34 years \u2013 an extraordinary feat in one of the world\u2019s most fractious countries. He likened his survival technique to \u201cdancing on the heads of snakes\u201d and his political career ended much as it had begun, in turmoil. Between 1974 and 1978, the Yemen Arab Republic had three presidents in quick succession. Two were assassinated and the third fled after less than a month in office. A four-man presidential council then took over, in which Saleh soon emerged as leader. In July 1978, the People\u2019s Assembly elected him president of the republic and commander of the armed forces, but there were few who expected him to last very long. Coming from a lesser branch of the Hashid tribal grouping, he was born in the village of Beit al-Ahmar, near the capital Sana\u2019a. With minimal education, he had risen through the military but had little in the way of a political base \u2013 a problem that he set about correcting during his first few years in office. What he lacked in education he made up for with his shrewd handling of people, gradually building a consensus which, besides the military, embraced businessmen and technocrats along with tribal and religious leaders. He had no particular ideology beyond republicanism and nationalism. The high point of his presidency came in 1990 when, after years of on-off negotiations, Saleh\u2019s Yemen Arab Republic united with the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Yemen \u2013 the southern part of the country that had been ruled by Marxists since the British withdrawal from Aden in 1967. This initially resulted in a power-sharing agreement for the unified state \u2013 a coalition in which the ruling party from each side shared power and a presidential council chaired by Saleh with Ali Salem al-Beidh, the southern leader, as his deputy. At the same time, Yemen opened up its political system; new newspapers and magazines proliferated and more than 20 parties competed in the 1993 parliamentary elections \u2013 the first to be held in the Arabian peninsula under universal suffrage. Promising as this seemed at the time, it was something of a mirage. The former regimes of north and south had unresolved differences which were allowed to persist under the guise of democratic differences rather than using democracy as a means to resolve them. Most important of these differences was the failure to properly merge the armies of the former northern and southern states, which led to them coming to blows during a brief war in 1994 that was won by Saleh\u2019s forces. With his southern rivals out of the way and the whole army under his command, Saleh had an opportunity to consolidate Yemen\u2019s national unity but instead he allowed grievances in the south to simmer, leading to a revival of separatist activism. From 2004, at the opposite end of the country, Saleh also fought an intermittent war against Zaidi rebels known as the Houthis, as well as militants linked to al-Qaida in various parts of the country. Saleh\u2019s relationship with the jihadists was always somewhat ambivalent. They had helped him defeat the southern forces in 1994, and though he always claimed al-Qaida was an enemy, he had an interest in not eradicating it. Without the threat from al-Qaida, western countries would have been far less interested in giving him aid. For years, Saleh was reputedly a regular chewer of qat \u2013 Yemen\u2019s national drug \u2013 and, since it causes wakefulness, would often follow it up with tipples of whisky in order to sleep. It was at the whisky stage that Saleh got most of his worst ideas, according to one former prime minister who used to unplug his phone at 10pm to avoid presidential calls. Saleh was also happy to play the democratic game so long as he kept on winning. In 1999 he submitted his own presidency to the electorate for the first time \u2013 and won easily, though it undoubtedly helped to have an opponent from his own party (whose campaign expenses Saleh had promised to pay). In 2005, he announced that he was stepping down. \u201cLet\u2019s transfer power peacefully,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are fed up with us, and we are fed up with power.\u201d Naturally, his party pleaded with him to stay and Saleh, feigning reluctance, remained in his palace. Had he left office at that point, he would have done so with a fair record of achievements. He had unified the two halves of the country, had overseen the introduction of a multiparty system and had finally settled Yemen\u2019s borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman, as well as the maritime border with Eritrea. Like Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, Saleh was widely thought to be grooming his son, Ahmad, to succeed him in the presidency. Legally, he was due to retire in 2013, though he had been making moves to change the constitution and continue for longer. His rule had also become increasingly repressive, with the local media in particular under almost constant attack. Then came the Arab spring. At the start of 2011, popular uprisings broke out in Tunisia and Egypt, giving Yemenis ideas about political change, too. It soon became clear that the northern rebels and southern separatists were not the only malcontents; in fact almost the entire country had turned against Saleh\u2019s rule. While claiming that he was willing to leave office if allowed do so \u201cwith dignity\u201d his behaviour suggested otherwise. Despite being abandoned by many within his own ranks, he clung on regardless while his power evaporated all around him. There was a narrow escape in June 2011 when a bomb exploded in the private mosque of his presidential palace. Several of the worshippers were killed and Saleh, seriously injured, was flown to Saudi Arabia for treatment. Protest demonstrations in Yemen continued and it was not until February 2012 that Saleh was finally cajoled into leaving office. Under a deal brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council, he was replaced by his deputy, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, but the deal also allowed Saleh to stay in Yemen and granted him immunity from prosecution. This proved disastrous because it allowed Saleh to make mischief from the sidelines. He still had a considerable support network and used it relentlessly to undermine his successor. In pursuit of that goal he also formed a surprising alliance with his former enemies, the Houthi rebels. It was only because of Saleh\u2019s support that the Houthis were able to seize control of the capital, Sana\u2019a, in 2014, causing Hadi to flee. This later resulted in a Saudi-led military intervention aimed at restoring Hadi\u2019s government \u2013 and a continuing humanitarian catastrophe. Last week, in what seems to have been a planned move, Saleh turned on his Houthi allies and attempted to wrest control of the capital from them. He had clearly lost none of his political ambition but, for once, his snake-dancing skills failed him and Yemen\u2019s wiliest politician came to a brutal and humiliating end. He is survived by several children, including Ahmad, a former military commander. \u2022 Ali Abdullah Saleh, politician, born 21 March 1942; died 4 December 2017"
"20||Should all teenagers have a Saturday job?For many people, having a Saturday job is a rite of passage. But according to new figures, fewer schoolchildren are taking on part-time work than they were five years ago. Jobs for young people aged 13-15 years old \u2013 including waiting tables, newspaper rounds and leaflet delivery \u2013 require child employment permits, and the number of those issued has fallen by a fifth since 2012 across 140 local authorities. Not having a Saturday job could be detrimental later in life. A 2015 study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found those who did not participate in part-time work during their school years were ill-prepared for full-time employment. We asked the public about their Saturday jobs and what they learned by working during their teenage years. Harriett, 22, student I worked as a shop assistant and the biggest thing it taught me was to have patience when dealing with people. It also helped me mature a bit more, and maybe not go out and spend much at the weekend! Chris, 37, graphic designer I had a job changing the lightbulbs in Tesco on Saturday and Sunday nights when the supermarkets were closed. We\u2019d drive all over the country and do the light bulbs all at once because that was cheaper then doing them as they break. I also worked as a binman, which taught me to appreciate staying in bed in the morning. Chris, 36, council worker I worked in a bookies. and learned how to offer customer service to all different kinds of people. I think a Saturday job is good to have \u2013 it pays for driving lessons and prepares you for the nine to five. You also learn to appreciate your weekends more! Tariz, 39, occupational therapist I had three jobs! My first was at Marks &amp; Spencer over Christmas. It taught me how to communicate, how to be good with money and how to prioritise the things that are important to you. So if you want to go on holiday you learn to only buy things that you really want so you can save. Rosemary, 72, retired I earned a lot by babysitting. My parents had said that I could go on holiday to Sicily with my school friend if I saved for half the cost and then they would pay the rest. This was in 1962 and I was getting one shilling a week pocket money and I would earn five shillings a week for babysitting. It was just nice to have a bit of my own money. Roland, 73, retired I used to work on a recycling plant in Switzerland in the 60s. In those days my parents couldn\u2019t afford anything, if we wanted something, like a bike, we would have to go and work for it. I think kids these days are spoilt. Life is all about give and take, and not about \u201cI want\u201d but more about \u201cI would like\u201d. Shamin, 31, retail manager I learned to be responsible because I worked on a market stall and was usually left on my own. I definitely recommend working a Saturday job growing up so you\u2019ve got something to show when you go into the job market. Even if you do a degree, having some kind of experience is important no matter where you end up working. Adam, 19, security guard My first job was a paper round \u2013 in the summer it was good; in the winter not so good. I learned that it was hard work. I did that when I was 15 and 16 years old, and it wasn\u2019t good money, but it still taught me how to work for it. I would 100% say that a Saturday job is beneficial because \u2013 you learn stuff and you can always do with a bit of extra money without having to ask your parents."
"21||'Good puppetry is an art': how we made GremlinsJoe Dante, director I was down to my last few bucks before I got the Gremlins job. I\u2019d directed The Howling, which had done well, but the company had gone out of business before they could pay me. When Steven Spielberg\u2019s script arrived, I was convinced he\u2019d sent it to the wrong address. The only way to make the story believable was if it was completely stylised. I insisted on shooting it on back lots, creating a small-town setting evoking Frank Capra\u2019s It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. We actually included a clip of that in the film, in case the audience didn\u2019t get the message. The original script was more gruesome, with Gizmo morphing into Stripe, the bad gremlin. But then Spielberg had the brilliant idea, which I think makes the picture remembered today, not to turn him into a monster but to have him carried around in the backpack of the hero Billy [Zach Galligan], like in a \u201cboy and a dog\u201d movie. Howie Mandel, who did the voice of Gizmo, already had a baby voice in his comedy repertoire, which I think we speeded up a bit. Howie\u2019s performance was a major part of making the creature credible. For Gizmo\u2019s singing, we auditioned loads of professionals, including an opera singer, but ended up using this little girl with a lovely voice found by Jerry Goldsmith, who wrote the score. We were pushing the envelope with technology. It wasn\u2019t until we made Gremlins 2 that it had advanced to the point where we could get Gizmo running and dancing. The sets were generally built up off the floor, so the puppeteers could be underneath operating the monsters. We used marionettes in a couple of scenes, but they\u2019re not especially convincing. Good puppetry is an art. When it\u2019s done as well as it was in Gremlins, CGI technology can\u2019t do it any better. At the preview, after the scene where one gremlin explodes in a microwave, a mother watching with her kid came storming up and shouted at me that it was totally unsuitable for children. The Warner Brothers studio didn\u2019t get it at all, didn\u2019t think it was funny. But the picture became a phenomenon, one of the biggest of the year. It came out of nowhere. It was just one of those things you\u2019re lucky to have once in your career. Zach Galligan, actor I\u2019d already auditioned for parts with Phoebe Cates before and felt very comfortable with her. When it came to the session for Gremlins, I rested my head on her shoulder and gazed at the camera. I\u2019m told Steven Spielberg said: \u201cOh my God, look at that! He\u2019s in love with her already. I don\u2019t need to see anything else.\u201d For Phoebe, it was a more innocent role than her previous movies such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but I was just a deeply terrified, inexperienced young actor doing my best not to get sacked. Probably the most nerve-racking scene to shoot was when the cinema where the Gremlins have been watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs blows up. Safety regulations were more lax on Hollywood sets back then. When we asked the explosives guy how big the explosion would be, he said: \u201cWell, we\u2019ve packed it pretty good.\u201d I thought: \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d In the event, it was deafening. And the heat was so intense, I thought it had singed my eyebrows. It blew the doors off the theatre, as you can see in the film, and it shattered windows on a building at Universal a mile away. Acting opposite Gizmo wasn\u2019t difficult, because pretending a lifelike puppet is a live animal is no harder than pretending a woman you\u2019ve just met has been your wife for 15 years. It was also beneficial having practical special effects, because I was reacting to a thing that was really there in front of me, as opposed to stuff you are attempting to imagine, as you would with CGI. You can even see it in the performance of the dog, Barney, which must be one of the top 10 animal performances in movies. He was convinced the puppets were real. The affection he had for me was genuine, too, because I\u2019d spent days playing with him and petting him. Every time he saw me I was this endless treat machine. Recently I was at a Las Vegas convention and there were three 15ft-high slot machines. Two were The Wizard of Oz and Lord of the Rings, the other was Gremlins. I thought: \u201cLook where this little movie has come to sit in the pantheon of films.\u201d I used to be grumpy about being continually asked about it. Now, to have been in a film that is the 80s equivalent of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life feels pretty amazing. \u2022 Zach Galligan\u2019s Gremlins Q&amp;A tour of UK cinemas ends 10 December, including BFI Southbank, London, on 8 December."
"17||Works by artist who died in Grenfell fire to be shown at Cambridge galleryWorks by Khadija Saye, an emerging artist who died in the Grenfell Tower fire, are to be exhibited as part of the reopening of Kettle\u2019s Yard in Cambridge. Saye was asked to be part of the show before she died, with her mother, in the flat they shared on the 20th floor of the west London tower block last June. Andrew Nairne, the director of Kettle\u2019s Yard, recalled seeing the 24-year-old\u2019s work \u2013 a series of six small framed tintypes \u2013 at the Venice Biennale\u2019s diaspora pavilion. Nairne was struck not just by Saye\u2019s powerful photographs, but also her accompanying text, which recalled a recent trauma she had gone through and explained how that related to the works. \u201cIt is very rare [to] read something that sounds so completely honest and what the person is really thinking and wanting to say.\u201d Nairne said Saye\u2019s work reminded him of early Tracey Emin. \u201cI had slightly the same feeling about reading Khadija\u2019s text, that she had sort of broken the rules for how you talk about art, she had been so up front.\u201d Nairne met Saye the following month, when she accepted an invitation to be part of the Kettle\u2019s Yard reopening show. \u201cShe was very smart, [especially] for someone who hasn\u2019t shown much, if at all; she was extremely aware of how [her works] might look in the space and the need to encourage people to look closely.\u201d That meeting was on the Monday, two days before the fire. When Nairne was told on the day of the blaze that Saye lived at Grenfell Tower, and high up, he feared the worst. \u201cI just burst into tears, actually \u2026 It was just so dreadful.\u201d Kettle\u2019s Yard had intended to show four of Saye\u2019s photographs from Venice and two new ones that she would make in the autumn. The works feature Saye undertaking Gambian rituals and remedies that she had once gently teased her mother about. Saye was born in London and won a scholarship to Rugby school, before studying at the University for the Creative Arts . Her best friend Charlotte Levy told the Guardian last June: \u201cShe was just the most incredible person. She went through so much stuff, but she always listened and was always there for you. She was making such powerful work, but still saying she didn\u2019t have a clue. She was such a beautiful person, she lit up a room.\u201d Works by 38 artists will feature in the Kettle\u2019s Yard show, including nine new commissions by artists such as Rana Bergum, Cornelia Parker, Jeremy Deller, and Idris Khan.

"22||The Muslim director who filmed neo-Nazis: \u2018I thought \u2013 I\u2019m not going to make it out\u2019Last summer, the documentary film-maker Deeyah Khan started to receive the sort of threats \u2013 of being raped, tortured, gassed and killed \u2013 that vocal women from minority groups often get with hateful frequency. In a BBC interview, Khan had made the apparently contentious point that Britain was never going to be all-white and that we should build a future where we all belong. She was used to racial abuse \u2013 as a child growing up in Norway (her mother is from Afghanistan; her father from Pakistan), she knew of neo-Nazi marches, and her brother was once chased by racists and had to hide under a car. But the abuse she received last year was particularly vile and relentless, and Khan decided she didn\u2019t want to be afraid of this generation of newly emboldened white supremacists any longer. Instead, she thought, she would try to find out what made them think and say the things they did. The result is her film White Right: Meeting the Enemy. It focuses on the rise of nationalism in Donald Trump\u2019s America, from the \u201calt-right\u201d to all-out neo-Nazis. She spent time with various leaders in the movement, going to their meetings, including the August rally in Charlottesville where Heather Heyer, an anti-racist campaigner, was killed. She hung out with the followers of the movement, going out at night in the car with one as he leafleted a Jewish area with hate-filled flyers. She also met former neo-Nazis. \u201cI\u2019m a woman of colour,\u201d she says at the beginning of the film as she sits down to interview Jared Taylor, a well-known white supremacist. \u201cI am the daughter of immigrants. I am a Muslim. I am a feminist. I am a lefty liberal. And what I want to ask you is: am I your enemy?\u201d She says she felt frightened \u201cmany times\u201d during the making of this film. \u201cEven when I started getting comfortable with some of the people [she spent time with and got to know], the people on the periphery could be very unpleasant.\u201d It didn\u2019t make it into the film, but after the rally in Charlottesville, Khan and a colleague joined a neo-Nazi \u201cafterparty\u201d at a compound in the hills, which started to get out of hand. \u201cThey were starting to pull their guns. And not just guns, but, like, war-zone weapons. They had just come from Charlottesville and they were amped up from the fighting. I was looking around, going: \u2018I\u2019m not going to make it out.\u2019\u201d Her main reason for doing the film, she says, when we meet in a hotel in London, wasn\u2019t \u201cto find out how horrible they are \u2013 I already know what they stand for, I\u2019m not interested in their ideology. What I was interested in was trying to find the human beings behind the facade and to see what else there is to these people \u2013 and is it possible for me to sit with my enemy and for them to sit with theirs?\u201d Khan says she knows it would have been easy to make a film showcasing only how horrific these extreme views are \u2013 and there is plenty of that here \u2013 \u201cand then we think we\u2019ve done a really good job, but in a way we haven\u2019t because that\u2019s how they want to be presented. I do believe that it\u2019s possible to hold their opinions in complete contempt and not dehumanise them. I wasn\u2019t looking for them to say and do shocking things, get that on camera and leave. I was looking for something else. The layers and depths of who we are as human beings, that\u2019s what I\u2019m obsessed by. What makes people do the things they do? What makes people who they are?\u201d This is Khan\u2019s fourth film. In Norway, she had a career as a singer, becoming a pop star, but moved to London at 17. Having become more involved in activism, Khan had become frustrated at the lack of Muslim women\u2019s voices in public and set up the online magazine sister-hood 10 years ago, a platform \u201cfor people, including myself, to tell the stories that we believe in and to contribute to the wider conversations in our societies and communities.\u201d Khan felt that Muslim women were being talked about but not listened to. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to engage. [They think]: \u2018Maybe it\u2019s your culture to be beaten or cut, or to be threatened, so we won\u2019t get involved.\u2019 As if my culture is to be abused; as if the only people who get to define my culture are abusive men, not the men who aren\u2019t abusive, or people like me.\u201d It was around the same time that she came across the story of Banaz Mahmod, the 20-year-old London woman of Iraqi Kurd heritage who was killed by her family after divorcing her husband and falling in love with another man. Khan had never made a documentary before, but, with very little money and some Googled instructions on how to use film-editing software, she made Banaz: A Love Story. She planned to give the film away to women\u2019s rights groups until it was picked up by ITV. Her dealings with the TV industry hadn\u2019t been great \u2013 one channel said she could be credited as a researcher and they would get a \u201creal director\u201d in. She refused; the film won an Emmy award for best international current-affairs film. In White Right, the men who emerge are strikingly similar to the men in Khan\u2019s previous film, Jihad, which explored what attracted British recruits to the jihadi movement. \u201cTheir cause is different, but their motivations and the personality types are the same. You have the guy who just wants violence and wants to find a cause he can dress his violence with. But the vast majority of the people are either lost and looking for a sense of belonging or looking for a sense of purpose. This is true for the jihadis and these guys here. They\u2019re looking for something to contribute to and give to the world \u2013 in their opinion \u2013 in a positive way.\u201d Khan has come away from her recent experience, she says, both more afraid and less. \u201cWhat makes me more afraid is how organised, how galvanised [the white far right] are. They truly believe they are the victims. They feel like they have everything to lose and that\u2019s worth fighting for.\u201d But she also feels less frightened, personally, than she did. \u201cI spent my life hounded by men like this and I left liberated from the fear because I realised they\u2019re people who are just as messed up, in pain, broken or struggling as any of us. They just don\u2019t have either the support or means to deal with some of the things they\u2019re dealing with in a healthy way. I absolutely am not asking for people to feel sympathy for these guys \u2013 I don\u2019t feel sympathy for them \u2013 but that does not exclude my ability to try to empathise with them. Having experienced racism my whole life, I decided that hating them or being afraid wasn\u2019t enough for me any more.\u201d White Right: Meeting the Enemy is on ITV on 11 December at 10.40pm"
"13||Letter: Hugh Kearney obituaryIn 1978 the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was one of the venues visited by an exhibition, Treasures of Early Irish Art, that included the glorious Book of Kells, containing the four gospels, from Trinity College Dublin. Hugh Kearney and my husband, John Smeltz, obtained a grant to create a lecture/slide presentation, and professors from four universities toured the state and beyond to tell people about the book\u2019s beauty and significance. When the exhibition opened, there were queues around the block \u2013 museum officials told us that it had the largest attendance up to that time for any art show."
"7||Have we got just three months to avert a US attack on North Korea?The drumbeat for a potentially devastating war on the Korean peninsula, and one that could quickly spread with calamitous consequences, has grown louder in the wake of North Korea\u2019s latest missile test \u2013 its most advanced yet. The North\u2019s long-range inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch was in direct contravention of a battery of UN security council resolutions and in disregard for its increasingly estranged \u2013 and last remaining \u2013 ally, China. Meanwhile, a major US and South Korean military exercise began today involving 12,000 military personnel and, for the first time, US F-22 \u201cstealth\u201d raptors, precision bombing aircraft that the North Korean regime has zero chance of spotting with its antiquated systems. In advance of the exercises, the North Korean foreign ministry said that the Trump administration was \u201cbegging for nuclear war\u201d, while Trump\u2019s security adviser, HR McMaster, speaking at the Reagan Defense Forum at the weekend, said that \u201cNorth Korea is the greatest immediate threat to the US.\u201d At the end of a year of extraordinary brinkmanship, the desperately isolated regime in Pyongyang is in a last-ditch race to build a nuclear missile capable of reaching the US. This, it believes, is its only deterrent against regime change. It is also directed at a country that it is still officially at war with. North Korea also knows that its \u201cmillion-strong\u201d army of mainly conscripts will, despite their legendary fanaticism, be no match for the far better-armed forces of the US and its allies. North Korea suffers near-permanent fuel shortages, its ballistic missile programme a cover for army trucks whose petrol engines have sometimes been swapped for coal stoves. For an unpredictable US administration, there is an equal, deadly intent to prevent Kim Jong-un from reaching that final stage of rocket development \u2013 by force if necessary. Last week John Bolton, the former US ambassador to the UN and a notable hawk from the George W Bush era, visited London and the House of Commons. His mission, whether official or not: to relay that CIA chiefs have told Donald Trump that he has a \u201cthree-month window\u201d in which to act to halt the North\u2019s ICBM programme, after which the North Koreans will have the capability to hit US cities, including Washington, with a nuclear payload. This apparent March deadline, for what can only be considered a pre-emptive strike, was also mentioned to a former European parliamentarian by a senior US commander a few days ago at Panmunjom on Korea\u2019s demilitarised zone, which separates the North from the South. With speculation rife that the CIA director Mike Pompeo may replace Rex Tillerson as US secretary of state, the stand-off seems likely to intensify, because Pompeo reportedly takes an even harder line towards North Korea. The Trump administration still believes that China holds the key; that it can turn off the oil supplies that keep Kim Jong-un in power, and so bring about regime change. But for a deeply recalcitrant regime in Pyongyang that is believed to have stockpiled emergency supplies of oil for a year, this could edge it still closer to the precipice. And pretenders to Kim\u2019s hereditary Marxist-Leninist throne who might have been favoured by the Chinese, such as Kim Jong-nam, his half-brother, and Jang Song-thaek, his uncle, have either been assassinated or executed. Direct talks between the US and North Korea are a prospect more distant than ever. The long dormant \u201csix party talks\u201d aimed at defusing the Korean nuclear crisis \u2013 involving the US, China, Russia, Japan, and South and North Korea \u2013 probably have even less chance of being reconvened. Diplomacy may be the only way out of this swiftly developing crisis. But North Korea deeply distrusts the UN, while the Trump administration tolerates the UN only when it presents no challenge to US foreign policy. Such is the severity of the situation that now may be the time for China to take the initiative, and call on the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, to use his good offices, and those of his predecessors Ban Ki-moon and Kofi Annan, to pull both sides back from the brink and preside over UN-sponsored talks. These could also involve China and the European Union (which has acted as honest broker in the past), and eventually result in direct talks between the US and North Korea. The opening ploys would be to end North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear testing in order for it to comply with UN security council resolutions, and in turn halt further US-led military exercises on the peninsula. No efforts should now be spared to prevent a slide to war \u2013 with utterly appalling consequences for the planet. \u2022 Mark Seddon, formerly a speechwriter for the then-UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, is a visiting professor of international relations at Columbia University, New York"
"2||New York Giants fire Ben McAdoo one week after Eli Manning's benchingBen McAdoo has been fired as head coach of the New York Giants, a season after leading them to the playoffs. The 40-year-old seemed to have a bright future with the team after leading the Giants to an 11-5 record last season but they have struggled badly this time around, and are currently 2-10, tied for the second worst record in the entire NFL along with the San Francisco 49ers. McAdoo\u2019s firing comes as little surprise. Although there have been some mitigating circumstances \u2013 the team\u2019s best player, Odell Beckham Jr, has been sidelined by injury \u2013 the Giants\u2019 owner, John Mara, said last week that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the team\u2019s record this season. McAdoo had also attracted criticism after the Giants\u2019 quarterback Eli Manning was benched after 210 straight starts. ESPN reports that Manning will return as starter for New York\u2019s next game under interim coach Steve Spagnuolo. There have also been discipline issues and reports of internal strife within the Giants: McAdoo suspended two players for violating team rules earlier in the season. McAdoo himself appeared to be ready for Monday\u2019s news. \u201cI understand where the fans are coming from,\u201d McAdoo said after Sunday\u2019s loss to the Oakland Raiders. \u201cIf I was on the outside looking in, I\u2019d feel the same way they feel.\u201d The Giants also fired general manager Jerry Reese on Monday. Reese had been the team\u2019s GM since 2007 and they had won two Super Bowls during his time in New York. McAdoo, who was the team\u2019s offensive coordinator until he stepped up as head coach, had struggled to win over fans in the high-pressure sports environment of New York. His dress sense was widely mocked, while a 12-year-old McAdoo impersonator seemed more popular than the coach himself."
"7||Upward mobility has been shattered. And no one in power cares enough to fix itIf I wanted to save capitalism, I would prioritise social mobility. Not Jude the Obscure-style mobility, where it happens over generations, but the kind we achieved in the postwar era. The kind that sent orphan, gang member and naval rating Bernard Schwartz to acting school to become Tony Curtis. The kind that makes things better in your lifetime and, in fact, in your first decade as an adult. I know this kind of social mobility is possible because I am a product of it. My paternal line on Ancestry.co.uk reads: hatmaker, hatmaker, hatmaker, miner, miner, economics editor of Newsnight. What made the difference? In the rightwing version of my life, the explanation is that I was sent to grammar school. Five boys out of a class of 30-plus selected by examination to be taught Latin by priests instead of woodwork by bored laypeople. But plenty of my classmates ended up \u201cback\u201d in the working class: as police sergeants, office drudges or military personnel. No, for me, grammar school was just the sharp tip of an arrow pointing upwards that was created by an entire economic system: the postwar Keynesian settlement. If I look at a picture of my dad as a schoolboy in the 1930s \u2013 partially deaf and among the poorest kids in the class, destined for the pit like his own father \u2013 and then think about him discussing Solzhenitsyn with me in the 1970s, I can understand that upward social mobility was a long process; a culture; a collective effort. My father lived through the thing that terrified Richard Hoggart, in The Uses of Literacy, and then Eric Hobsbawm: the decline of the implicitly brutal and subliterate \u201cproletarian way of life\u201d. Watch a movie such as Saturday Night and Sunday Morning or This Sporting Life to understand the yearning for improvement, non-brutality, tenderness and advancement that gripped working-class people in the 1950s. This, in turn, had material roots: cheap rents, free education, aggressively interventionist social work against dysfunctional families, TV stations run by philanthropists rather than, as now, people determined to promoting ignorance. If I wanted to save capitalism, I would tell Theresa May to implement all this urgently \u2013 and more. She is not listening, of course. The government\u2019s entire social mobility commission, led by Alan Milburn, quit last weekend, days after penning a sombre report warning that \u201cBritain is in the grip of a self-reinforcing spiral of ever-growing division\u201d. Not \u201cgetting better\u201d, not even \u201climiting the damage and stabilising things\u201d, but fostering a self-reinforcing process whereby poor kids are trapped in poverty for ever, certain that their own kids will be just as poor and probably even less likely to break out of poverty. One of the most depressing things about Milburn\u2019s final \u201cstate of the nation\u201d report was the maps. Industrial towns such as Wigan, where I grew up, are low-to-middling when it comes to the overall picture of decline. The real blackspots are predictable entirely through geography: the off-the-network seaside towns, the places you can never quite remember between two motorways, the rural areas, the extremities \u2013 these are the places where social mobility is appalling. If it were not for London, cranking out literate, worldly teenagers from its comprehensives and estates, there would hardly be a social mobility story at all. The irony is that, when we were kids, every Saturday evening was spent listening to a list of these places being read out, as a kind of egalitarian national roll call, in the football and rugby results. Mansfield, Motherwell, Colchester, Llanelli \u2013 places you would never actually visit, but could be fairly sure were being looked after because a plummy-voiced BBC man was reading them out, week after week, in the same breath as Manchester United and Chelsea. Milburn\u2019s report provides the clearest reminder that this national story of upward mobility has been shattered. And by what? The neoliberal economic system didn\u2019t start out trying to suppress the upward mobility of working-class kids. But that is what it has achieved. Blairism momentarily checked the decline, but it is back now with a vengeance. You can point to austerity or to objective factors such as the decline of semi-skilled manual work \u2013 but at the policy level it is just neglect. Every headteacher is judged on the improvements they make for individual children, yet the government is never judged against the neglect and cruelty through which it makes the poor powerless and traps the talented in layers of indifference. You could buy this sick system a few more years if you dropped all other obsessions and concentrated on getting a chosen few poor kids out of poverty. That\u2019s the intent behind all the schemes aimed at getting poor and ethnic minority children through the barriers of the Russell Group universities. But nobody in government appears to care enough to fix it. They care a bit \u2013 but not as much as, say, reciting Kipling\u2019s Mandalay in a Myanmar temple, taking holidays in Israel or rescuing colleagues who have committed sackable offences. As Milburn put it in his resignation letter, the government does not have enough bandwidth to do what Labour and Conservative governments after the war were obsessed with \u2013 making sure a minority of working-class kids break out of poverty. People ask (and rightly) what it is that Jeremy Corbyn has to do to seal the deal with the British working class \u2013 even now wary of Labour in big enough numbers to keep the Tories neck and neck. I know what cemented my dad\u2019s generation to capitalism: a culture of social mobility; the rising possibility of self-improvement; an upward curve; a cheeky optimism. Your kids will go to university; they will get a toehold in the housing market; their wages will rise; things will get better for everybody: these were the promises on which Labour sealed the deal with the postwar working class. That they seem like Bolshevism now, in the era of May and Rees-Mogg shows how difficult it will be to revive them and how tired British capitalism has already become."

"3||Families at inquests should get funding if police do, says chief coronerBereaved relatives should be granted legal aid at inquests in which the government pays for lawyers to represent police officers or other state employees, the chief coroner has urged. Judge Mark Lucraft QC\u2019s recommendation in his first annual report will add to the growing pressure on the government to grant special funding to families seeking justice in controversial cases such as deaths in police custody, in prison or while waiting for an ambulance. Among his proposals for changes to the law, Lucraft\u2019s report, published on Thursday, proposes that the lord chancellor, David Lidington, \u201cgives consideration to amending the exceptional funding guidance (inquests) so as to provide exceptional funding for legal representation for the family where the state has agreed to provide separate representation for one or more interested persons\u201d. The chief coroner noted that in \u201ca small number of inquests\u201d the family of the deceased wish to have representation but do not have the means to pay for it themselves and are unable to obtain legal aid funding. \u201cIn some cases, one or more of the agencies present such as the police, the prison service or ambulance service, may be separately represented,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn some of these cases, individual agents of the state such as named police officers may also be separately represented. \u201cWhile all of these individuals or agencies may be legally represented with funding from the state, the state may provide no funding for representation for the family.\u201d The \u201cinequality of arms may be unfair or may appear to be unfair to the family\u201d, Lucraft observed. \u201cIt may also mean that the coroner has to give special assistance to the family which may itself give the appearance of being unfair to others.\u201d Deborah Coles, the executive director of the charity Inquest, which supports relatives at coroners\u2019 courts, welcomed the report. \u201cThe new chief coroner has supported the call for legal aid,\u201d she said. \u201cWe now have unequivocal evidence that this needs to happen. The government can no longer fail to act. \u201cWe have had former chief coroners, the Angiolini report into deaths in police custody and the report by the chair of the Hillsborough Independent Panel all calling for bereaved families to have legal representation in deaths related to the state or its agencies. \u201cIt\u2019s now time for the government to make this a political priority. Access to justice should not be determined by your financial situation. These families perform a public service in scrutinising the deaths that have occurred. It\u2019s for the benefit of all of us.\u201d The government has previously argued that the relative informality of inquests and their inquisitorial, as opposed to adversarial, nature does not, save in exceptional cases, require bereaved families to be legally represented. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cIt is vital that inquests are sympathetic to the needs of the bereaved.\u201d They said ministry guidance on legal aid was changed in November \u201cto ensure that the starting presumption is that it should be available for representation at an inquest\u201d."
"2||Huge spike in women's footy participation figures tells revealing storyAt 36, Jacinta is playing competitive sport for the first time in her life. Well, almost the first. As a teenager she idolised the Brisbane Bullets, and asked to take up basketball. Driven along to tryouts, she was told that the uniform for girls was not shorts, but bloomers. Bloomers, like the underwear she wore under her skirt to school netball. She asked if she could wear shorts like the boys, but was told no. A chubby kid, she was embarrassed, and decided basketball wasn\u2019t for her after all. She\u2019d never much followed sport after that, especially AFL football. She felt, as Anne Myers powerfully portrays in her prologue to the Women\u2019s Footy Almanac, that footy constituted a \u201cmicrocosm of patriarchy at its worst... a hyper-masculinised environment that fosters a distorted sense of entitlement and privilege among young men\u201d. She knew the faces and the names, men who \u201cbehave badly\u201d, and disrespect women, but are \u201crewarded with media contracts and pats on the back\u201d. As a feminist, the stakes of following Australian rules football were too intense to bear. But, as with Myers, and so many other women, things changed with the introduction of AFLW. For the first time, following AFL footy didn\u2019t mean compromising her values. At last \u2013 visibly at least \u2013 there were women to idolise, people like Susan Alberti, or Moana Hope (featured on Australian Story on the eve of the inaugural women\u2019s national league). Alberti, who wouldn\u2019t take no from the AFL executive for an answer and propped up the women\u2019s league of her own financial accord, or Hope, \u201cheart and tatts on her sleeve, and a kick to match\u201d. Women who inspired, with \u201cdetermination, toughness, and a humility and gentleness of soul\u201d. The rest, as with season one of AFLW, is history. Today, Jacinta is one of 463,364 women playing some form of Australian rules football, after an explosion in the number of dedicated women\u2019s teams \u201cway beyond\u201d the AFL\u2019s own expectations. The number of women\u2019s teams is now 1,690 nationally, a huge 76% increase on last year. Let that sink in: a 76% increase. On the back of these unprecedented numbers, women now account for 30% of the total participation numbers in the game, helping drive a 10% increase overall on participation figures in the sport for 2017. These numbers are not just restricted to the traditional AFL footy heartland of Victoria, either. Almost a quarter of women playing are from Victoria (108,021) but there is significant uptake elsewhere \u2013 even in the traditionally rugby league-dominated expanses of Western Sydney. In NSW and the ACT, there was a 78% increase in women playing in registered club football competitions. When the GWS Giants\u2019 success is inevitably questioned again, perhaps one should start by pointing there. Part of the story of course is the growth in youth competitions, which will finally ensure pathways from grassroots to elite football for women. For example, in NSW and the ACT, the first competition for girls under the age of 12 had 30 teams in its inaugural year. Nonetheless, it would be a mistake to see the boost in overall participation as wholly dictated by \u201cgirls\u201d taking up the sport. Anecdotally, AFLW has been a game-changer for women who had written themselves off from participating in sport. And the numbers back this up. The Victorian Amateur Football Association, which started with a base of four ex-VWFL clubs, ended up with five senior divisions and an unofficial \u201cscratch match\u201d division of six teams for clubs with an overflow of numbers. These numbers tell an important and revealing story. They tell of women too long ostracised from a game they didn\u2019t have a chance to know they loved. Women like Jacinta, or Anne, who turned to music and politics, to anything but sport, and AFL football in particular. For them, sport went hand in hand with misogyny, with disrespect for women: whether this be at the level of sexist uniforms for girls, or protection and reward for men who behave badly at the elite level. It doesn\u2019t matter how accurate this story is. Those of us who love sport know too well the nuances of the games we love: we know the stories about the St Kilda schoolgirl, but we also know about the involvement of stars like Marcus Bontempelli, Patrick Dangerfield and Shaun Burgoyne in The Line\u2019s violence against women ambassador campaign. We know that sport is not the unambiguous monster that it can seem until you love it enough for those complexities to emerge, to give it the benefit of the doubt it only sometimes deserves. The joy of so many more girls and women now involved in the game is both their chance to feel what sport brings so many of us and also what their participation does to the sport and its culture from within. After AFLW, Australian rules football will never be the same, and that is an unambiguously good thing."
"24||Did you solve it? This traffic teaser will drive you to distractionIn my puzzle blog earlier today I set you the following puzzle: Five cars are driving round a roundabout. In order, the drivers are Akira, Basho, Chie, Daichi and Etsu. The cars have licence plates numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, but not necessarily in that order. Each driver can see only the licence plate of the car in front of them and the car behind them, but not of the car they are driving. All the drivers can speak to and hear each other via headphones. A voice comes into their headphones and asks: \u201cIs your licence plate a square number?\u201d They all reply in unison: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d The voice repeats: \u201cIs your licence plate a square number?\u201d They reply in unison \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d except Etsu, who pipes up saying: \u201cErm, no\u201d. The voice asks: \u201cIs your licence plate number bigger than the number of the plate behind you?\u201d Daichi is getting annoyed now: \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d. After which Basho and Etsu state: \u201cNo\u201d And Akira and Chie grin: \u201cYes\u201d Who is in which car? Solution. Scroll down for the answer. Or if you would like to solve it yourself, use each step as a hint before moving on to the next one. Step 1. The cars are numbered from 1 to 5. The only two square numbers in this group are 1 and 4. (Which are 12 and 22). When asked if their car is a square number, i.e. either 1 or 4, all drivers say \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019. Since no one knows the number of their own car, no one can answer this question \u2018yes.\u2019 But there is another possibility. If the two cars a driver sees are the 1 and the 4, then that driver would respond \u2018no\u2019, since they know their car is neither the 1 nor the 4. Since no one says \u2018no\u2019, we can dismiss the situation in which there is a single car in between the 1 and the 4. In a circle of five cars, if there is no single car between the 1 and the 4, then the 1 and the 4 must be adjacent. Step 2 The same question is asked again, \u2018is your car a 1 or a 4\u2019, and Etsu says no. We can deduce that Etsu is in the position opposite the 1 and the 4. She will have worked out from Step 1 that the 1 and the 4 are adjacent. If she could see either a 1 or a 4, her response would be \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019, so she must see neither the 1 nor the 4. And if she sees neither, her car is not a 1 or a 4 since the 1 and the 4 are adjacent, and the cars adjacent to her are neither a 1 nor a 4. Because we know the order of the drivers, we know that the 1 and 4 have Basho in one and Chie in the other, and the 2, 3 and 5 are divided among Akira, Daichi and Etsu. Step 3 The voice asks if the driver\u2019s plate is bigger than the one behind. Daichi doesn\u2019t know. He knows from Steps 1 and 2 that the 1 is taken by either Basho or Chie, which means that we can deduce he is not seeing the 2 behind him, since if he was he would know that his is larger and have answered \u2018yes\u2019. And we can also deduce he is not seeing the 5, since then he would have answered \u2018no\u2019. So Daichi is seeing a 3. (i.e. Etsu is 3) Basho sees Chie behind him. He answers that his number is NOT bigger than Chie\u2019s, in which case it must be less, which means that he is seeing a 4 behind him. So we know Chie\u2019s car is 4 and Basho\u2019s is 1. Chie, who knows she has a 4 since she can see a 1 in front of her, says that the number behind her is less than 4. So Daichi does not have the 5. Neither does Etsu have the 5 from above, so Akira must have the 5. By a process of elimination Daichi has the 2. The result: Akira 5, Basho 1, Chie 4, Daichi 2 and Etsu 3.

"0||Australia's citizenship saga resurfaces 'legacy of pain' for Indigenous MPsRequiring Indigenous politicians to prove their Australian citizenship has been an upsetting and anger-inducing process that resurfaced a colonial \u201clegacy of hurt and pain\u201d, two federal parliamentarians have said. Some were unable to say when or where their family members were born because the Australian government never registered the births or recognised them as citizens. Linda Burney, a Wiradjuri woman, was not considered an Australian citizen until she was 10 years old, and in her maiden speech described her experiences of \u201cracism and exclusion\u201d. Being forced to justify her place in Australia again, as the federal parliament sought clarity on everyone\u2019s citizenship status, was \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d, Burney told Guardian Australia. In an attempt to end the continuing parliamentary chaos over breaches of section 44 of the constitution, all parliamentarians have been required to lodge declarations and evidence of their citizenship. The forms request the date and place of birth for parliamentarians, their parents and their grandparents, as well as any evidence required to show any citizenships to other nations were renounced. \u201cI have been made to feel quite angry about what I had to go through to find out about my father and his parents,\u201d said Burney. \u201cThe only way that we could find out anything was to go to what was left of the old Aboriginal Protection Board records, and there was a document written by my grandfather to the mission manager on Brungle reserve, requesting permission to build a home. \u201cTo go and have to do that, to go to the old Protection Board records, to realise the best they could do was a letter requesting permission to build a roof over their heads, it really stirred up a lot of deep emotions. Some of that was just disgust and an understanding of the way our people were treated.\u201d Burney said she understood there had to be a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d in the citizenship crisis and she hoped this process would achieve it. \u201cSomehow or other this issue needs to be dealt with, intelligently and sensitivity, because I suspect there are people \u2013 not just Aboriginal people \u2013 who are going to find out some very difficult family histories.\u201d The NT Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy told Guardian Australia there were \u201cmoments of outrage\u201d as she sat in her office trying to complete the questionnaire. \u201cBecause just a simple act of filling out this document reminded me of how far our country still has to go in recognising First Nations people in our country, and the legacy of previous policies and the impact they still have today,\u201d she said. \u201cIt brings up a lot of hurt, the legacy of hurt and pain, because we reflect on very real circumstances on the past that impact on the present.\u201d McCarthy was raised on Yanyuwa country, near Borroloola in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to an Indigenous mother and a father of Irish descent. She is a traditional owner of Yanyuwa land and uniquely has declared as much on the parliamentary registry. \u201cThe difficulty for my maternal side of the family is that we don\u2019t know the dates of when my grandparents were born on Yanyuwa country and Garawa country, or even the dates of my mother\u2019s birth, although we\u2019ve always guessed it was around 1950,\u201d she said. \u201cMy maternal grandmother we guessed around 1930. \u201cI don\u2019t know [details for] my maternal grandfather and that\u2019s largely because statistics and birth certificates were just not part of the way of Australia and the policies of the time didn\u2019t include us.\u201d McCarthy said she had no concerns about an unknown second citizenship in her background, but added the Labor party\u2019s vetting was strict. Other parties appeared to be more lax. Among those to have been found ineligible is Jacqui Lambie. The former Tasmanian senator is Indigenous, but her father\u2019s Scottish heritage bestowed upon her dual citizenship, overriding her place as a First Nations Australian. Western Australian senator and Yawuru man Pat Dodson declined to be interviewed but in a speech to farewell Lambie he decried the system which \u201cput to one side\u201d her Indigenous heritage. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute tragedy that our constitution was written by all these white folks that never bothered to consider and incorporate the First Peoples in it,\u201d he told the Senate. McCarthy said: \u201cThis is what the non-Indigenous men of the day, when they wrote this constitution, this is what they determined for this country. \u201cThe question is do we want to change that?\u201d To change it would require a referendum. Referendums are difficult to win \u2013 something Malcolm Turnbull recently cited to justify his total rejection of an Indigenous voice to parliament. McCarthy said constitutional recognition of First Nations people must come before any changes to section 44. \u201cIf there is a genuine approach to [the concerns of First Nations people], and if First Nations people can see and will believe that, then any steps towards changing the constitution would probably follow suit,\u201d she said. \u201cBut until there is a genuine engagement and sincere respect with First Nations people, this will always be something that claws at our country and it won\u2019t matter what politicians will want to do to change it \u2013 if they want to change section 44 \u2013 because the First Nations people will still be demanding equality.\u201d Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, said the process was raising issues \u201cacross the board\u201d, including for MPs whose parents fled war-torn countries to come to Australia. Plibersek told ABC Radio National on Tuesday it was \u201cawful\u201d and traumatic for Indigenous MPs, probably more so than for others. \u201cWhen this [constitution] was written there was no such thing as Australian citizenship, we were subjects of the British empire. It just shows what an anachronism this is. Nevertheless the rule is there and the rule has to apply equally to all.\u201d She said it would cost tens of millions of dollars to hold a referendum and it was much easier to just follow the rules."
"12||ABC radio programs PM and The World Today to be halved in lengthThe flagship ABC radio current affairs programs PM and The World Today will be halved in length next year and Business PM will be axed, staff have been told. PM and The World Today will both be reduced from hour-long programs to 30 minutes, radio current affairs employees were told at a meeting on Monday by Tanya Nolan, the managing editor of audio current affairs. From 22 January The World Today, hosted by Eleanor Hall, will end at 12.30pm instead of 1pm to make way for a new \u201centertaining\u201d national program on ABC Local Radio hosted by the former Triple J presenter Myf Warhurst. Warhurst\u2019s show, which is designed to attract 30- to 40-year-olds with a \u201clighter\u201d offering, will run until 2pm. Staff were told the rationale behind the changes was research showing there were significant increases in audiences consuming on-demand audio and digital content and a drop in the numbers listening to linear broadcasts on the ABC. The under-55 audience was not coming to the ABC as it once did, and something had to be done to reverse the trend. Nolan, who also oversees RN Breakfast, AM, Background Briefing and RN Drive, told staff the shortened 30-minute PM and The World Today \u201cwould leave the audience wanting more\u201d. The head of spoken content, Judith Whelan, told staff the new local radio schedule would be unveiled on Wednesday and most of the time slots were changing. From next year PM will air at 6.30pm on local radio so Drive can be extended from 6pm to 6.30pm in each state. Afternoons will run from 2pm to 4pm and Drive will run from 4pm to 6.30pm. The changes mean the output of programmed radio current affairs will be reduced from two and a half hours a day to 90 minutes. But reporters will be expected to do more live crosses into local radio programs because Nolan said there was \u201can over-reliance on packages\u201d which can \u201ckill the energy\u201d of a program. Nolan said she would prefer reporters in the field did more live crosses into Drive than longer reported stories for dedicated programs. PM, hosted by Mark Colvin from 1997 until his death in 2017, is the sister program to AM, which turned 50 this year. First heard on 7 July 1969, PM is broadcast across the ABC\u2019s local radio network after the 6pm news until 7pm. Business PM is a 10-minute dedicated business slot from 6.50pm to 7pm hosted by Elysse Morgan. A shorter version of PM is also broadcast on Radio National after the news at 5pm. Journalists will also be encouraged to brush up on their conversational and informal talking skills so they can make podcasts and do more live chats. The changes will fuel fears that Radio National \u2013 and linear radio in general \u2013 are increasingly under threat as resources are diverted to digital services. The ABC\u2019s managing director, Michelle Guthrie, has unveiled a restructure of content divisions that will see Radio National broken up and responsibility for its programs scattered around the corporation. The major changes come just days after radio current affairs journalists shone at the Walkley awards for journalism. Jane Bardon\u2019s coverage of Indigenous affairs for ABC Radio, Matt Brown\u2019s international coverage of Islamic State for AM and ABC Radio\u2019s senior business correspondent Peter Ryan\u2019s coverage of the Commonwealth Bank scandal for ABC Radio were all honoured on Friday night. Other ABC news programs to be decommissioned in 2017 include Lateline and Stan Grant\u2019s The Link."
"2||'A beautiful thing': Tyler Wright on the surf family who raised a championA surfer bobbing in the ocean can often cut a solitary figure but the sport at the professional level is far from the solo show it may sometimes seem. As Australian Tyler Wright returned to dry land at Honolua Bay with a second world title under her belt on Friday, she rightly took the individual plaudits \u2013 but it was the people working tirelessly to get to her this point who were on her mind. Her individual brilliance over the course of the World Surf League season had just helped her defend her 2016 title, a reward for consistency in a tightly-contested campaign, but as she said in the initial moments after the quarter-final win over Brisa Hennessy that put paid to her challengers\u2019 hopes, \u201cit takes a team to do this\u201d. It\u2019s a sentiment the 23-year-old would repeat to the Guardian a few hours later, once the initial euphoria of becoming the ninth woman to claim a second championship had died down. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the fortunate position to be able to work with incredible people that were able to see the potential in me and also know how much more there is,\u201d she said. \u201cThey hold me to a higher standard than most others do.\u201d None more so than her coach, Glenn \u201cMicro\u201d Hall, who has been instrumental in her success since teaming up two years ago. The former professional surfer, who also mentors Matt Wilkinson on the men\u2019s tour, understands what makes Wright tick, how to maximise her potential. With Wright\u2019s raw talent and Hall\u2019s holistic approach to coaching, it\u2019s a match made in surfing heaven. \u201cFirst up, Glenn is just a good human and a good family man. I value that in life a lot,\u201d Wright says of Hall. \u201cHe\u2019s also a very good coach and has a great understanding of what it takes to bring out the best in an athlete and push them, but also have that athlete being happy and healthy and absolutely loving what they\u2019re doing so they don\u2019t burn out. \u201cI\u2019m in a fortunate position to have someone like him. He\u2019s not going to tell me that I have to want to win because if it\u2019s not within me, I\u2019m not going to want to win. \u201cHe\u2019s always been one who\u2019s said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to ask for anything that you\u2019re not going to be able to give\u2019 ... He has an incredible understanding of everything. I respect him in a lot of ways.\u201d Wright, who hails from a strong surfing family on the south coast of New South Wales, won her first world tour event title at 14, but such early success did not convince her professional surfing was the path she should take. It was not until the arrival of Hall that she became convinced of her calling. The pair soon hatched a plan with the grand aim of winning a championship every year. \u201cIt came from six years of not knowing what I wanted to do and whether I wanted this career or not,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a plan they have so far managed to stick to. Hall gets Wright. She doesn\u2019t always want to be pushed, to be told what to do. For her, mental and physical wellbeing is of the utmost importance, and Hall\u2019s approach to her management allows for this. The benefits are being reaped. \u201cSome days it is just easier to go take a nap,\u201d she says. \u201cBut at the end of the day I like working hard, I like doing what I do and getting to work with people I work with. They want me in a happy and healthy mind state which is what they\u2019ve been able to do. \u201cFinding that balance for a coach and for a team has been incredible. I always saw myself having a short career until Glenn came along and showed me a different way to compete.\u201d If Hall is more of a recent influence on Wright\u2019s career, the support network provided by her close-knit family has been there since the beginning of her journey from Culburra Beach to global stardom. The relationship with her brothers has been well documented \u2013 particularly Owen, following the high-profile accident that derailed his own world title hopes two years ago \u2013 but it was her mother who was on hand in Hawaii last week to lend her support. Fiona Wright wasn\u2019t able to get to France last year to witness her daughter secure her first title \u2013 much to Tyler\u2019s disappointment \u2013 and she had to make do with an emotional reunion at Sydney airport upon Tyler\u2019s return home. This year, tickets were booked in January for Fiona, along with two of Tyler\u2019s aunties and her uncle, to travel to Maui. There was no way she was going to miss the chance of seeing a second one. The fruits of that family bond \u2013 with her immediate and extended family \u2013 has shaped the person Tyler is today. \u201cIt takes a group of people to raise someone, I\u2019ve always thought that,\u201d Wright says. \u201cI come from a town where everyone has family and everyone plays a part in helping out. There are a few families who helped raise me and helped me become the person I am today. That grounding and foundation point in life is a beautiful thing and something that I appreciate as I get older.\u201d Last week\u2019s victory meant Wright became the first woman since Stephanie Gilmore to win back-to-back world titles (Gilmore won four in a row between 2007 and 2010). Wright shrugged off a knee injury sustained earlier in the season but was ousted at the weekend by Gilmore the eventual winner of the Maui Pro. It means she ended the season with just one event win \u2013 the Rio Pro in Brazil. After last season\u2019s five victories, it\u2019s a curious statistic, one which probably reflects the evenness of this year\u2019s competition. It ultimately won\u2019t be dwelled on for too long \u2013 the record will still read: Tyler Wright, 2017 world champion. She moves closer to Carissa Moore \u2013 one of five women who arrived in Maui still harbouring world title hopes \u2013 who is on three title wins. Gilmore (another contender in Maui) is sitting on six and Layne Beachley heads the list with seven. Wright says she doesn\u2019t know if she will go on to match any of those women, but with last year\u2019s experience helping her deal with the pressure of the final event this time around, it\u2019s a fair assumption that she will be even better placed with another successful season under her belt to challenge for honours once again next year. In the meantime, with the backing of her team and family, she plans to continue riding the wave of success. \u201cI\u2019m just going to keep doing what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she says. \u201cI really like what I\u2019m doing.\u201d"
"0||Liberal leadership change would not affect most voting intentions \u2013 Guardian Essential pollA majority of Australians polled in the latest Guardian Essential survey said a leadership change within the Liberal party would make no difference to their vote at the next federal election. Asked whether a leadership change would make them more or less likely to vote for the Liberal party, 18% of the Guardian Essential sample said they would be more likely to vote for the government at the next election, 13% said less likely, and 54% said it would make no difference. Among Coalition voters, 29% said they would be more inclined to vote for the government with another leader, 16% said less likely, and 46% said it would make no difference. The new survey of 1,836 voters also confirmed the Turnbull government was closing out the torrid 2017 political year trailing Labor by 10 points, with the opposition ahead on the two-party preferred measure 55% to 45% \u2013 meaning the ALP would easily win any election held today. The new poll comes as the Turnbull government pushed through what is expected to be the final sitting week for the year, with parliamentary debate over same-sex marriage and new citizenship declarations from MPs dominating proceedings. Malcolm Turnbull has attempted to use Barnaby Joyce\u2019s victory in the weekend byelection in New England to stabilise the government\u2019s fortunes, and the government is also continuing to pursue the strife-prone Labor senator Sam Dastyari about his dealings with Chinese business leaders, targeting him in the parliament \u2013 although Labor is attempting to return fire. While the prime minister entered the final sitting week batting off leadership speculation, the new poll suggests Turnbull remains the top choice as Liberal leader, although his support has dropped 4% since August, and the foreign minister, Julie Bishop is only just behind the prime minister on a ranking of six contenders. While Turnbull attracted 21% support and Bishop 19%, 15% of the sample nominated \u201csomeone else\u201d other than the list they were given \u2013 which was Turnbull, Bishop, Tony Abbott, Christopher Pyne, Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton \u2013 while 27% of the sample, the highest percentage, replied \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d to the question. Abbott, the former prime minister, who says he will only return to the Liberal party leadership if he is drafted, was favoured by 10% of the sample. Dutton, a favourite of up-and-coming conservatives, was supported by 4% and Morrison and Pyne by 2% each. Turnbull was also the clear choice of Coalition voters, with 40% preferring him as party leader compared to 20% for Bishop and 13% for Abbott. Given a clique in the National party has been engaged in open warfare with the Liberals and with Turnbull over the past couple of weeks as Joyce has campaigned to hold his electorate of New England, voters were asked this week whether the Liberal and National parties should continue in Coalition, orbecome more independent of each other. In the wake of the Liberal National party\u2019s disappointing result in the recent Queensland state election, some Nationals have been talking openly about more assertive product differentiation from the Liberals. But the poll sample was split \u2013 with 38% thinking the Liberal and National parties should continue to work together and 34% thinking they should become more independent of each other. The view among Coalition voters was much clearer \u2013 73% thought the parties should continue together, and 13% believed they should separate. Given the knife-edged result in the recent Queensland poll, with voters evidently intent on lodging a substantial protest vote despite the risk of returning a minority government, and given the finely balanced parliaments in Canberra in 2010 and 2016, voters were asked for their views on which type of government they preferred. Over half of the sample (54%) said they preferred a majority government, while 25% would prefer a government with more minor parties where no single party had a majority. The views were skewed by voting intentions. A clear majority of Coalition voters (69%) favoured a majority government, while 48% of Greens voters preferred a government where no single party had a majority. Voters also took a dim view of politicians resigning from their party and then continuing to sit in parliament on the crossbench, with most (51%) arguing that politicians who resigned from their party should be forced to resign from parliament. Only 24% thought defectors should be allowed to continue in parliament. Voters were also asked this week about sexism. A majority of respondents believed there was a lot or some sexism in the media (64%), politics (60%), advertising (60%), workplaces (57%) and sport (56%). Women were more likely than men to think there was a lot or some sexism in all areas \u2013 but especially in workplaces (women 67%, men 46%) and politics (70% to 49%). There have been small recorded differences in the figures since the questions were asked last January. Sexism in workplaces has dropped 4%, media has risen 6%, sport fallen 4% and schools has gone down 8%. There is, however, a more significant change in the differences between men and women on some issues. On sexism in the workplace, the gap between perceptions of men and women increased from 12% to 21%."
"7||In cynical times, two paramedics have shown the power of our shared humanityMy young refugee patient is perched uncomfortably and too high up on an ambulance trolley. He is so small and malnourished that there is enough space on the narrow stretcher to accommodate the fat folder of notes that have come along with him for the ride. He is recovering in rehabilitation from a fracture and chemotherapy is on hold. \u201cWhy are you here so early? I thought we cancelled this appointment,\u201d I ask in dismay, having seen him only days ago. \u201cI told them you said not to come but they still sent me; no one listened to me,\u201d he replies. As I realise how accustomed he is to disempowerment, he shifts uncomfortably, and my irritation froths at all the seemingly small administrative errors that translate into enormous inconveniences for sick patients. I have nothing new to say beyond establishing that he is making steady gains in rehab. In deference to his long and uncomfortable journey to clinic, I try to extend the consultation by making small talk but when there is no family, no job and your survival relies on small mercies, this task becomes herculean. My tentative explorations elicit a tearful, \u201cDoctor, let\u2019s not talk about sad things.\u201d \u201cFair enough,\u201d I concede. I struggle to manoeuvre the ambulance trolley but eventually we burst through into the waiting room where a dozen faces look up at my patient. Just then, the paramedic hurries up. \u201cSorry, doc. I could have moved him.\u201d His surprised expression at the rapid appointment doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by me. \u201cThere was an error, he didn\u2019t need to come today. Can you take him back now?\u201d I beg, suspecting the answer. \u201cIt\u2019s a long wait for non-urgent transport. We assumed he would be here for a few hours, doc.\u201d My patient says nothing but his face falls. The thought of him spending hours perched on a trolley in a public waiting area seems unbearable but I find that I am not alone in thinking this when the paramedic says, \u201cHold on, I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d I stay by my patient\u2019s side wordlessly, hoping he can hear me thinking that if strangers want to stare at him, they can stare at us both. The paramedic returns triumphantly. \u201cWe\u2019ll put you with another patient going the same way. Let\u2019s get you back, love!\u201d For the first and probably only time that day, my patient smiles. \u201cThank you,\u201d I mouth to the paramedic, now joined by her colleague. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d they say but my heart fills with relief. Here were two people who saw my patient not as a job number but a human being deserving of the same attention as people who were fit, able, vocal. Going about my day, I am touched by their instinctive act of kindness performed with no fanfare. Recently the whole world had a chance to witness the humanity of paramedics. Two paramedics in Hervey Bay were transporting a terminally ill patient to a hospice when she mentioned her wish to see the beach one last time. Her husband and she had moved to the area spontaneously and had never left. So, what did the officers do? They didn\u2019t mention the queue of waiting patients; they didn\u2019t balk at her irregular request; they didn\u2019t groan at the number of approvals they\u2019d need. No, they simply pulled over, gently wheeled her out; and positioned her so she take one final look at the breathtaking beauty of the water. Dwell for a moment on the enormity of their gesture, which may well have delivered to their dying patient the most precious parting gift of all, a chance to say goodbye to that quintessentially Australian thing, the beach. The photo that captured the moment is at once simple, unpretentious, staggering and humbling. It is an unforgettable reminder of the things in medicine that we hold dear but routinely struggle to deliver \u2013 love and compassion and humanity. Transcending defined roles and responsibilities, this most human of gestures simply says, \u201cWe know this matters.\u201d The typical dying patient today has endured a stepwise decline in health which has resulted in multiple trips to hospital and innumerable appointments, tests and procedures. Doctors, nurses, pharmacists and allied health all blur into one. Thin gowns, bland meals and noisy nights are a recipe for disempowerment. Imagine then, escaping all this but knowing it\u2019s your final journey. What do most people ask for at the end of life? Peace. Dignity. Kindness. This is what the two paramedics gave their patient. This is why the world is applauding them \u2013 for filling in the gaps that medicine strives to fill. Judging by the paramedics that I have met, I bet they wonder what the fuss is about. They might claim it\u2019s no big deal \u2013 but it is. In a time of discord, angst and cynicism over all manner of local and global issues, these paramedics have shown us the power of our shared humanity. By taking a dying patient to her favourite beach, preserving her anonymity and not seeking the limelight, they have forced us to examine our lives and our motivations. Many of us might well ask, \u201cHow far would I go to help a fellow human being?\u201d It\u2019s not often that the mundane act of transporting an ill patient prompts the world to stop and think. We should thank the dying patient who unwittingly illustrated a life lesson by deciding what was really important. And we should celebrate as heroes the two paramedics who allowed their patient her final view of an Australian beach and gave us a glimpse of humanity at its best. \u2022 Ranjana Srivastava is an oncologist and a Guardian Australia columnist"
"6||Australian consumers need protecting in an economy dominated by so few playersA report by the Grattan Institute into competition in the Australian economy has found that Australian markets are not especially concentrated compared with other nations. It also found that a greater market share held by a smaller number of firms does not necessarily lead to greater levels of profits. The report however does confirm that our supermarket sector is overly concentrated and policies can be implemented to ensure greater competition including a move already under way by the government to make it easier for consumers to switch between providers and control their own data. One of the more common consumer complaints is that there is not enough competition in major industries. The banking, supermarket and petrol retail sectors especially come under fire. A lack of competition and domination by a few firms can lead to implicit collusion \u2013 such as is often suggested occurs with petrol prices seeming to go up in unison on Thursday. The issue is not just a dry economic one. The shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, has written extensively on the issue, arguing that a lack of competition is damaging the economy. The report by the Grattan Institute\u2019s Jim Minifie, Competition in Australian, examined this issue and found somewhat surprisingly that while a lack of competition did hurt our economy, the damage was not as great as might be expected. Minifie argues that \u201clarge firms are not unusually dominant in Australia given the size of its economy\u201d and they \u201cdo not have an unusually large share of Australian output and employment\u201d. Take for example the banking sector. The market share of the top three banks is actually quite low compared with the rest of the OECD. While the market share of the top five is above average, it is \u201cnot much more concentrated than it is in other high-income economies of about the same size\u201d: But at least here the signs of increased market concentration are evident. As a result of mergers that were allowed to occur in the aftermath of the GFC, the market share held by the top four banks is significantly higher than it was at the start of the century: The issue is whether or not this impacts on reduced competition and thus hurts the economy as consumers end up having to pay more for services and goods that they otherwise would have. The problem Minifie found is that you can\u2019t just assume market concentration leads to higher profits. What is important is not just how many firms dominate an industry but also why they dominate. If \u2013 as in the case of banks \u2013 the reason for the concentration is mostly due to regulation, then the industry does not see a greater proportion of \u201csuper-normal profits\u201d (which are those that are greater than the expected shareholder return) than in other industries with low barriers to entry (such as builders, accommodation services or restaurants). But industries, which are either natural monopolies, where only a few firms can actually carry out the service (such as electricity generation or airports), or scale economies, where the cost of doing business is such that bigger has an inherent advantage (such as supermarkets, domestic airlines or petrol retailing), are much more likely to see above expected profits: Thus among the most concentrated industries, those which have the greatest share of the profits coming from \u201csuper-normal profits\u201d are those with either scale economies \u2013 ISPs, internet publishing, supermarkets, or are natural monopolies such as wired telecommunications. The Grattan Institute report on the other hand found banks report a lower share of super-normal profits than highly competitive industries such as motor vehicle retailers and childcare services. The report also found the largest businesses in Australia have not over the years taken a greater share of the overall revenue \u2013 with the biggest 20 firms since the early 1990s usually accounting for around 54% of total revenue received by all firms listed on the Australia stock exchange: This, however, does not mean there are no issues. Our supermarket sector is one of the most concentrated among high-income countries. Our two biggest firms in the sector (Woolworths and Coles) account for 69% of the market compared with 52% in Canada, 44% in Germany, 43% in the UK and 32% across the United States: However over the past decade the two big supermarkets have actually lost market share as Aldi and Costco have begun competing. Minifie suggests once Amazon Fresh and the German company Kaufland enter the market, the share held by Woolworths and Coles will continue to fall, which will lead to \u201cgreater diversity and lower prices\u201d. The report also recommends relaxing zoning restrictions that can limit the entry of competitors: By contrast thetelecommunications sector \u2013 both ISPs and mobile communication \u2013 while being very concentrated is not unusually so. The report notes that \u201chigh-income countries tend to have only three or four mobile networks, and their three-firm market shares typically exceed 80% \u2013 in Australia currently Telstra, Optus and Vodafone account for around 90%: But this is one area where the report notes policy progress can be made, and which the government is already making moves to introduce changes. The report argues that strong regulation aimed towards lower prices appears necessary for natural monopolies such as electricity distribution and transmission, ports and wired telecoms, given the level of their super-normal profits. But it also argues that consumers should have the power to \u201ctake their data with them to another provider\u201d to encourage competition in telecommunications, banking and other industries. Last week the assistant minister for cities and digital transformation, Angus Taylor, announced that next year the government would seek to legislate a \u201cconsumer data right\u201d which would enable customers \u201copen access to their banking, energy, phone and internet transactions\u201d. This would make it much easier to compare the cost of different services and crucially reduce the burden of switching banks or utility providers. The Grattan Institute report highlights that while market concentration can lead to excess profit-taking by firms, this mostly occurs in industries where the barriers to entry \u2013 either due to cost or the nature of the business \u2013 are high. In such cases the government needs to ensure firms are not taking advantage of consumers, but the report also makes clear that while firms have too much market power in a few industries, overall Australia\u2019s economy is little different from most nations."
"11||Cavalleria Rusticana/Pagliacci review \u2013 compellingly sung operatic miseryIt\u2019s hard to believe that Damiano Michieletto\u2019s production of opera\u2019s best-known double bill got booed here two years ago. No doubt those few noisy people were still smarting from his controversial Guillaume Tell a few months earlier. Nobody\u2019s taking aim at him this time, nor should they. Generally, Michieletto\u2019s treatment of Mascagni\u2019s and Leoncavallo\u2019s one-acters is solid and almost cinematic in its detail. As revived by director Rodula Gaitanou, its temperature fluctuates according to who is on stage, though that may be Mascagni\u2019s fault as much as anyone\u2019s. Michieletto is not the first director to dream up an intertwining of these two slabs of operatic misery, but he makes a notable success of it. With Paolo Fantin\u2019s chunky revolving set representing the bakery and the community hall, both operas are set in a poor Italian village which attracts tragedy as swiftly and often as Ambridge or Albert Square. In Cavalleria\u2019s intermezzo we see Pagliacci\u2019s Nedda and Silvio, and what leads up to their first kiss; in Pagliacci\u2019s orchestral interlude we see Cavalleria\u2019s Santuzza being reconciled with Mamma Lucia \u2013 which is the more welcome for being a rare moment of light and hope in a dark evening. Indeed, it\u2019s Elena Zilio, returning as Mamma Lucia, who in many ways makes the biggest dramatic impression, her role bumped up hugely so that she is on stage for much of Cavalleria. She\u2019s a more interesting character here than El\u012bna Garan\u010da\u2019s Santuzza, whose silvery, powerful singing \u2013 this is a distinctive and exciting voice \u2013 is an odd fit with her one-dimensional characterisation as a dowdy doormat, cringing away from an accusing statue of the Virgin that comes to nightmarish life. Anna Pirozzi\u2019s vampish Lola and Mark S Doss\u2019s wide-boy Alfio offer sturdy support, but Daniel Oren\u2019s energetic conducting doesn\u2019t draw much nuance out of the orchestra; the introduction to the Intermezzo is promising, but then the Big Tune comes in with a massive thump. It might be a blow to realism that Bryan Hymel, whose Turiddu was bleeding to death at the end of Cavalleria, clearly returns as Canio in Pagliacci \u2013 he\u2019s standing in for Fabio Sartori for the first three performances of the run \u2013 but in other respects it\u2019s a bonus; his focused, bullseye-hitting tenor sounds gripping in Vesti la giubba. Carmen Giannattasio is a fresh-sounding Nedda, Luis Gomes makes a lovely job of Beppe\u2019s aria and, best of all, there\u2019s a welcome return for Simon Keenlyside as a scheming Tonio who demands every bit of our attention. \u2022 At the Royal Opera House, London, until 13 January. Box office: 020-7304 4000."
"25||Police have killed dozens of children in Philippines war on drugs, Amnesty saysPolice have killed dozens of children in the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d in the Philippines in the last 18 months, Amnesty International said. The rights group urged the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into crimes against humanity in the violent crackdown, including the deaths of an estimated 60 young people by police and vigilantes. Some of those killed were deliberately targeted in anti-drugs raids, while others were caught in the crossfire. There have also been \u201criding in tandem\u201d attacks, carried out by vigilantes on motorcycles, which are often paid for by police, Amnesty said. Relatives of some of the victims told the rights group how they witnessed police fatally shooting children at point blank range as they were begging for mercy. The killing by police of a 17-year-old student, Kian Delos Santos, in August, sparked nationwide protests in the Philippines after CCTV footage emerged of him being dragged along the street by two plain clothes officers, casting doubt on police claims he was shot in self defence. More than 12 police officers have been investigated for the Santos killing after the case received international attention, but no one has yet been held to account. Since Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president, took office in June 2016, more than 3,900 \u201cdrug personalities\u201d have been killed in his anti-drugs campaign, although activists say they are suspected users and alleged small-time dealers. More than 2,000 others have been killed in drug-related crimes and thousands murdered in unexplained circumstances, according to police data. In October, amid waning public support for his deadly campaign, Duterte ordered police to end all operations in his anti-drug offensive, and placed the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in charge, saying the shift was to target big networks and suppliers. James Gomez, Amnesty\u2019s director for south-east Asia and the Pacific, said: \u201cHow many bullet-riddled bodies must be found dumped on the streets before the international community takes action? \u201cIt is time for international justice mechanisms to step in and end the carnage on Philippine streets by bringing the perpetrators to justice. The country\u2019s judiciary and police have proven themselves both unwilling and unable to hold the killers in the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 to account. \u201cThe ICC must open a preliminary examination into the situation and cast its net widely. Responsibility is not just limited to those pulling the trigger, but also those who order or encourage murders and other crimes against humanity.\u201d The ICC recently indicated that it will investigate and pay special attention to crimes against children. Duterte and other high-level government officials have openly advocated for extrajudicial killings, which could amount to criminal responsibility under international law, Gomez said. One 17-year-old victim was killed after he was woken up in the middle of the night. The victim\u2019s partner, known as O, told Amnesty: \u201cThey pointed a gun at my head [and] told me to get out \u2026 I heard shouting and three gunshots, then three more shots.\u201d Researchers from Amnesty witnessed large numbers of children suspected of drug-related offences kept in overcrowded and unsanitary holding centres for minors in the Philippine capital, Manila. Some said they had been beaten and tortured by police on their arrest, and claimed police had framed them by forcing them to pose in photographs with drugs that had been planted."
"22||How to dispose of a dead pet: is taxidermy the very best option?This year, a woman from Dundee posted an unusual ad for her dog, Snoopy, on Facebook\u2019s Marketplace. The unusual thing about it was that the dog was dead. \u201cHad our dog turned into a rug when he died,\u201d the ad read. \u201cTreasured family pet. Has to be sold as new dog keeps trying to hump it. Lookin for 100 pound ONO. Very cosy and unusual piece.\u201d Cosy is questionable; unusual was an understatement. Snoopy\u2019s flattened form and smiling face were considered so shocking that editors on the Telegraph and Argus and the Dundee Evening Telegraph put warnings at the top of their stories. By then the ad had already been howled off Facebook and the owner of the dead pet had backed away into anonymity. What do you do with a dead pet? What is the appropriate farewell to these creatures that psychologists call \u201cself-objects\u201d, so familiar they are almost a part of you, sighing sympathetically while you weep, cavorting idiotically, loving you uncritically. How do you cope without the pet whose lifespan encompassed long-outgrown childhoods and that your kids loved sometimes more than they loved their parents? And why, when we make desirable items out of leather, and admire stuffed animals in natural history museums and pass the mounted head of a stag without a second glance, why does turning this pet into an animal skin seem so ... wrong? Psychologists can explain how we love the way a pet offers uncritical, uncalculating affection in an otherwise conditional world. They talk of pets as witnesses to our lives. I\u2019m with them on that. More than a year after the second of our border terriers died, her earthly remains, along with her mother\u2019s from a couple of years earlier, are still boxed up just as they came from the pet crematorium. They live under a chair, out of sight, but not in any way finished with. For a start, we have yet to summon the courage to say goodbye. And we can\u2019t decide how to do it: burial in the garden, or scattering along the way of a favourite walk? Casual and informal, or with readings and tearful recollections? This is what they call disenfranchised grief. Sam Carr, a psychology lecturer at the University of Bath who is interested in animals and attachment theory, says pets are \u201cthere in every page of your narrative. When you lose that kind of figure, there\u2019s a trauma.\u201d It is a kind of bereavement, which demands some formal response. But there isn\u2019t one. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone who either skinned or stuffed their pet,\u201d says Carr, \u201cbut I can imagine it offered some kind of respectful way of commemorating their life, maybe a tribute or a celebration.\u201d George Jamieson, a taxidermist who works near Edinburgh, describes good taxidermy as \u201ca frozen moment. It\u2019s as if the soul of the animal is still there. It\u2019s somewhere between not being able to let go and wanting to keep something of what was.\u201d Jamieson used to stuff pets, but now he finds it\u2019s too intensive, trying to make a realistic portrait of an animal that is already dead. He doesn\u2019t say so, but I\u2019m left with the impression that people who want their dead pets stuffed are psychologically needy in a way that someone who deals with dead animals for a living finds difficult to handle. Victorians loved taxidermy. Death was a daily threat and the death of a loved one commonplace. Sentimentality seems to have been a way of holding fear close in order to control it. Walter Potter\u2019s Museum of Curiosities exhibited homemade anthropomorphic dioramas of stuffed white rabbits dressed as small schoolchildren sitting in rows in a classroom. Others featured kittens at tea and animal weddings. It was a hugely successful visitor attraction in Sussex (and, more recently, at the short-lived Brooklyn Morbid Anatomy Museum). At B\u00edtov Castle in Moravia, whole rooms are dedicated to the deceased pets of the castle\u2019s last owner, Baron Georg Haas. Unlike the clumsy realisations in the Potter museum, the baron\u2019s dogs, mainly terriers, lie heads up, ears cocked, poised to leap up after a rabbit. A pet, by definition, is an animal without a purpose, kept for love and amusement. They have been kept since at least classical times \u2013 we know because their lives were recorded on vases and stellae as lovingly then as they are photographed and painted and memorialised now. Pet owners have been chastised for their excessive attention to their pets in the face of the suffering of the world for just as long. And the negotiation between the pet as an animal (and therefore a creature without a soul, ultimately lesser than a human) and the pet as a family member, which is part of the everyday business of being a pet owner, isn\u2019t resolved by the pet\u2019s death. Yet there has never been any cultural accommodation with the peculiar nature of our attachment to some animals and not others. Most western thought divides all humans from all animals. So although it is widely acknowledged that we can love animals as much as or even more than humans, western society has never developed cultural forms that help us to manage the trauma of animal loss. On the whole, pet lovers who do anything choose burial. Some people really splash out. Pet cemeteries\u2019 offers range from statues and trees to online tribute sites. Frederick the Great, the Prussian enlightenment monarch, built himself a summer palace at Potsdam, where he buried his beloved greyhounds and marked their lives with exquisite calligraphy on marble tablets, and when he died he was buried with them. Peggy Guggenheim, one of the few people since who could match both Frederick\u2019s wealth and his love for his dogs, is interred with her terriers at her Venice palazzo. There is even the \u201cundeath\u201d option: a cloning service is now available in South Korea. More often, though, people try to cheat the fact of death by preserving the likeness of the living. Ronald, the horse that carried Lord Cardigan in the charge of the Light Brigade, has been split up into four feet (inkwells scattered around stately homes in Britain) while his head and tail remain at his master\u2019s home, Deene Park. But something about our sensitivities has changed. The animal rug \u2013 let\u2019s call it the Dundee option \u2013 is now on the outer edge of commonplace. Although not as far out as the Dutch artist Bart Jansen, who turned his dead cat, Orville, into a drone. Jansen insists he loved his cat, and denies there was an element of revenge in turning him into furry drone even though, when thwarted, Orville was a biter. About the same time as Snoopy went on sale in Dundee, I found an exquisite, unmarked kingfisher that must have flown into a window. The russet and turquoise streak that I have only glimpsed once or twice on the periphery of my vision was lying just outside my house. The desire to preserve it was overwhelming \u2013 not an image, but the creature itself, so rarely seen and still more rarely touched. Without really thinking, I found a taxidermist nearby and delivered the small body into her freezer, from where at sometime in the future I hope it will be resurrected. This, I realise, is what Damien Hirst meant when he called his shark the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living. Hirst is not the only contemporary artist who is fascinated by the dead/aliveness represented by taxidermy. Nature morte, the French expression for still life, works better as a literal translation. The artist Polly Morgan uses taxidermy to explore what was called in one of her exhibitions \u201cthe poetics of strangeness\u201d. She and Hirst were both represented in a show of 18 contemporary artists in Rhode Island last year. Of course, they used wild animals. We may try to avoid thinking about the reality of stuffing a wild animal, but it is not \u2013 yet \u2013 an uncomfortable idea. My stuffed kingfisher will not shock. According to Clare Fowler, the taxidermist I took my kingfisher to, people who want their pets stuffed often come to her as I did, in a state of unanticipated bereavement. She thinks that taxidermy serves as a waypost in the process of grieving. The ones who call her in advance \u2013 she works in deep, rural Dorset \u2013 because they are going to have their pet put down, usually change their minds after they have understood what taxidermy entails. The day I go, she is working on an old lady\u2019s pet cat, the second she has done for this client. It lies on her workbench \u2013 or at least the cat\u2019s head, still attached to its empty skin, lies there looking mildly surprised. Fowler will make a fibreglass mould from the body that the fur once encased, and then, after preserving the skin, stretch it back over the artificial form. This one will be a sleeping cat. \u201cI like to do them sleeping. It looks passive, and I think it\u2019s less difficult for the psyche. Sleeping ones are lovely and most people agree and go with it.\u201d Not all pet owners want a grief object. Fowler has mounted the head of a young man\u2019s terrier on a shield. It was an unusual request, but it didn\u2019t upset her. \u201cSome people would be shocked, but no one would think twice about a deer or a game animal. I do get a few people attacking me on Facebook. But people want it done. And I love animals. I think they [her critics] must think I\u2019ve skinned them alive or something, but I love fur and feather and this is about keeping that beauty.\u201d Her worst experience was a woman who first arranged for her cat to be stuffed and then asked her to take it out of the storage freezer and thaw it because she had bought a magical incantation on the internet that was guaranteed to bring it back to life. It didn\u2019t work. And then there was Elfie. Elfie was a cat who was fulfilling an important attachment role for her two owners, Rachel and Matthew, whose relationship was going through a rough patch. Elfie was killed on the road when Matthew was caring for her. \u201cI thought, what would Rach want \u2013 I know, I\u2019ll get her stuffed.\u201d The news of Elife\u2019s death was broken to Rachel. In secret, Elfie\u2019s unscathed body was rushed into a freezer, and then transported in an insulated box to Fowler in Dorset. Nine months later, the job was done. By then Rachel and Matthew were happily back together, and Rachel knew about the preservation project. \u201cRach was over the moon,\u201d according to Matthew, and \u2013 this must be why they are together \u2013 she says: \u201cI thought it was the most romantic thing ever.\u201d The not-dead Elfie sits alert at the top of the stairs. \u201cShe\u2019s been through it a bit, she looks a bit older,\u201d Matthew and Rachel agree. \u201cSome people jump and shriek. The new cat is a bit puzzled. But we don\u2019t get a big negative reaction. I know a lot of people don\u2019t have taxidermy in their house \u2013 but we love it.\u201d For nearly a decade, up until about 2012, the British artist David Shrigley used pet dogs and cats, stuffed, often standing anthropomorphically on their back legs holding placards saying: \u201cI am dead\u201d. It was an exploitation of the transgressive idea of stuffing a family member. Shrigley sees the pieces as something between black humour and a conversational gambit about the nature of death. And life. Since he acquired a puppy five years ago, Shrigley has abandoned using pets (although, he adds quickly, he never hurt an animal in his earlier work). He says he wants his work to be more positive (his was the thumbs-up on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square last year). Recently, struck by how the lambs gambolling outside his bedroom window were playing just like his puppy had, he stopped eating meat entirely. \u201cTaxidermy is such a weird thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a representation of life. But it\u2019s a representation of death.\u201d Odder still is that as the number of Britons who, like Shrigley, take up vegetarianism rises (6% now), so does the passion for pets and for unusual, unexpected ways of preserving their memory."
"14||Abandoned son of police spy sues Met for compensationA man whose father abandoned him as a child while working as an undercover police officer is suing the Metropolitan police for compensation. The man, who has been granted anonymity, alleges in the lawsuit that he has suffered psychiatric damage after discovering at the age of 26 that his father was a police spy, and not the radical protester he had been led to believe. On Monday in the high court, Mr Justice Nicol ruled against an attempt by the Met to have the lawsuit dismissed. The ruling clears the way for the man, identified only as TBS, to continue his lawsuit. He has said he wants \u201cto try to get some answers and an apology\u201d from the police about how he came to be born. TBS said the fact that his birth and childhood were based on a lie had been confusing. \u201cIt kind of messes with your identity and who you think you are.\u201d He told the Guardian he had suffered distress because he had grown up without a father figure. Finding out that this father figure \u201cwas denied to me because of the actions of the police is even more distressing because they are supposed to be upholders of the law \u2026 But they quite clearly are not,\u201d he said. The Metropolitan police agreed three years ago to pay his mother, known only as Jacqui, more than \u00a3400,000 to settle a lawsuit she had brought. An undercover officer, Bob Lambert, had begun a relationship with Jacqui during a covert deployment without disclosing to her his real identity. She only found out by chance that Lambert was a police spy more than two decades after their son, TBS, was born. After the discovery, she contemplated suicide and received psychiatric treatment. Lambert has been one of the most controversial of the undercover police officers sent to infiltrate political groups since 1968. He was a member of the Met\u2019s undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad. His deployment began in 1984 when he stole the identity of a dead boy and started infiltrating environmental and animal rights groups. He pretended to be Bob Robinson, a leftwing campaigner, and started a relationship with Jacqui, then a 22-year-old animal rights activist. She has said that when she became pregnant he seemed excited. He was at her side during 14 hours of labour when their son was born in 1985. They lived together for the first two years of his life and, according to Jacqui, Lambert seemed besotted with the baby. Lambert has been accused of setting fire to a branch of Debenhams in 1987 in a protest against the fur trade \u2013 an allegation he denies. In 1988, Lambert claimed that he had to flee to Spain as the police were on the verge of arresting him for crimes related to his animal rights campaigning. This was a false story as he had in fact returned to the Met\u2019s headquarters in London and resumed working for Special Branch, later managing the SDS\u2019s covert operations. One of these operations gathered information about the parents of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. In his real life, Lambert was married with two children. But he concealed his marriage and police work from Jacqui and TBS, and then abandoned her, leaving her to bring up their son as a single parent. TBS grew up believing that his father was a dedicated activist who had gone on the run from the police. TBS said his family \u201ctold me that story \u2013 he was really passionate about his animal rights and he had no choice, it was either stick around and get arrested or go, so it was for the best.\u201d He and Jacqui only found out the truth in 2012 after Lambert was unmasked. She happened to see his photograph in a newspaper article and tracked him down. TBS said: \u201cIt is quite scary to me just how the police can dip in and out of people\u2019s lives. They still seem to struggle with realising the impact of what they have done. They seem to think it\u2019s OK not to talk about it because they have got to protect undercover officers out there.\u201d He said the police had seemed content to allow him to go on believing the lie that his father had gone on the run. \u201cIt just adds to the confusion really \u2013 about how I came into existence and who was aware of it, who was making decisions. \u201cIt seems very bizarre that when I was born there was not someone who said: \u2018Right, this has gone too far, there\u2019s a whole new life here.\u2019\u201d In his ruling, Nicol said that it was not justifiable to dismiss TBS\u2019s claim as \u201cit does not seem to me that there is anything factually incoherent in his [assertions]\u201d. He ruled one aspect of the claim \u2013 whether Lambert\u2019s supervisors had committed misconduct after TBS had been born \u2013 was not sustainable, and he asked for more submissions from both sides. TBS\u2019s lawyer, Jules Carey, of Bindmans, said there was \u201csomething morally ambiguous\u201d about the police seeking to strike his legal action. He called on the Met to \u201cgive [TBS] the answers that he is so desperate for and the apology for their interference in his family life that he deserves\u201d. The Metropolitan police said: \u201cWe note the judgment in this case, which will now potentially continue to trial. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further due to the possibility of future proceedings.\u201d Lambert had four intimate relationships while he was undercover. In recent years the Met has paid compensation to at least 12 women who were deceived into sexual relationships by undercover officers."
"19||Children\u2019s reading on screen: in the beginning was the word, not a hotspotChildren\u2019s story apps and digital books face an international content crisis. In the US, an in-depth evaluation of best-selling apps showed that the majority do little to extend children\u2019s learning beyond rote academic skills. An analysis of Greek digital books available on the Android app store concluded that they \u2018in no way justify their title as educational, as they do not meet the developmental needs of the target age group.\u2019 The most popular apps in Hungary, Turkey, Greece and the Netherlands have extremely low levels of quality and often don\u2019t even offer stories in local languages. These findings follow the reports condemning the digital format for impeding children\u2019s language learning and dialogue between parents and children. Is children\u2019s reading on screen doomed forever? Cart before the horse With the widespread use of tablets among all sections of the population, the format came before the content. Yet, when it comes to children\u2019s books, content and form are intimately interlinked. Axel Scheffler\u2019s Flip Flap Safari would not work if the book wasn\u2019t cut in half and children couldn\u2019t flip the pages to create funny mis-matched animals. Moreover, digital books or story apps merge the characteristics of several resources into one (digital manipulative, book, game, artistic object). The question of their quality and impact therefore needs to be answered from multiple angles. For designers this means collaboration with several stakeholders. For researchers this means mixed methods and insights from many different disciplines such as communication studies, computer\u2013human interaction, developmental psychology, narratology, children\u2019s literature, social semiotics or game design. However, it is notoriously difficult to get funding for cross-disciplinary work and tricky for different disciplines to align their areas of focus. The marketing chain: Access and costs While three-year-olds have no preference and six-year-olds choose touchscreens over print books, national surveys show that parents strongly prefer print books for their children\u2019s reading. Digital books are perceived as part of entertainment but not learning. As a result, children either don\u2019t access many digital books at home or they use them on their own. Given that children\u2019s digital books are accessible from the same App Store as Angry Birds, parents often misinterpret their place in children\u2019s learning. High production costs mean that big children\u2019s publishers produce digital versions only of their best-selling titles. This approach increases audiences but does not earn them m(any) prizes for innovation. Smaller publishers, such as Nosy Crow, have many awards under their belt, but they are an exception and currently increase their market reach by translating successful titles (for example to Dutch with Gottmer Kinderboeken). Book-gifting schemes such as Bookstart or Dolly Parton\u2019s Imagination Library, have significantly contributed to the availability of printed reading materials among all sections of the population. High-quality digital books could be distributed with a simple download code. Worldreader project, in partnership with Pearson, has recently given free access to over 500 Hindi and English digitised storybooks to low-income communities in Delhi. But what makes a high-quality digital book? Different horses for different courses Declaring digital books as of good or bad quality requires a conversation about individual elements and their overall assembly. Take the presence of music in digital books, for example. Researchers and designers need to distinguish whether the music plays in the background or whether it interferes with the voiceover, whether it is congruent or incongruent with a word or the entire story, whether it is activated automatically or by the user, and so on. Each element makes a difference to a specific outcome: researchers at Bar-Ilan University recently found that quiet background music actually supports children\u2019s story comprehension. Of course, the overall value of an app cannot be determined just by studying the presence or absence of specific elements. Researchers need to also ask how music, sound effects, illustrations and moving images engage the readers, how they are used by different children and in different contexts. For adult readers, a recent systematic literature review concluded that the degree to which digital medium influences readers\u2019 comprehension depends on the text, task and the reader. The same applies to young children: While for pre-schoolers (children aged between three and five years) interactivity in electronic books interferes with parent-child reading, for toddlers (children aged between 17 to 26 months), reading electronic books could be more beneficial than print books because it makes the younger children more attentive and participative in the session. Catering well for both technological and literary needs is an ambitious combination for a young industry. Public-facing organisations that promote shared use of media such as the Children\u2019s Technology Review or Common Sense Media regularly publish expert-rated reviews of children\u2019s digital books. In the UK, the literacy charity National Literacy Trust publishes reviews of literacy-oriented digital books for 0-5-year olds as part of their Literacy Apps website. But more awareness-raising needs to happen among all adults who mediate access to children\u2019s books, including headteachers, booksellers and librarians. Although there are several websites dedicated to digital books, mainstream media need to push for better content and position children\u2019s digital books alongside printed books, as is the case with the UKLA Book Awards for example. Children\u2019s digital books are still forming as a new \u201cthird space\u201d genre, with exciting developments in virtual and augmented reality. Their future is bright but only if we allow them to frame their own story. Dr. Natalia Kucirkova is a senior research fellow at the UCL Institute of Education and co-edits the Bloomsbury academic books series Children\u2019s Reading and Writing on Screen."
"11||Sebastian Schwarz steps down as general director of GlyndebourneGlyndebourne have announced that their general director, Sebastian F Schwarz, is to step down from the role with immediate effect. Schwarz\u2019s appointment was announced two years ago, and has been in the role since May 2016. He succeeded David Pickard, who left the festival after a decade to be director of the Proms. Schwarz, who was previously deputy artistic director of Vienna\u2019s Theatre an der Wien for nine seasons, said in a statement: \u201cTo be Glyndebourne\u2019s general director for the last two years has been my honour and privilege. In my first encounter with a privately funded company I have come to appreciate Glyndebourne\u2019s unique and complex business model on which its success and survival are dependent and for which the general director is responsible, alongside providing the artistic strategy. While planning the seasons up to 2021, I have realised that I feel most at home in a position which allows me to concentrate more fully on creating and executing the artistic vision of an organisation.\u201d Schwarz\u2019s oversaw the 2016 and 2017 Glyndebourne seasons, which included the world premiere of Brett Dean\u2019s Hamlet and a new production \u2013 the first ever in the UK \u2013 of Francesco Cavalli\u2019s 1658 opera Hipermestra. Earlier this year, he announced a new international singing competition, the Glyndebourne Opera Cup, which will take place in March with Schwarz as the chair of the jury. He has programmed the Glyndebourne festival and tour seasons up to 2021. As an interim appointment, Gus Christie, Glyndebourne\u2019s executive chairman, will assume the role of acting general director. The announcement comes at the end of the festival\u2019s 2017 main festival summer season and tour. Schwarz, whose main home is in Venice, will remain in Sussex for the next few months working on the inaugural Opera Cup. \u201cSebastian is hugely respected and admired by everyone at Glyndebourne, and he has made an indelible mark on the organisation in his time with us,\u201d said Christie, grandson of Glyndebourne\u2019s founders John Christie and Audrey Mildmay. \u201cThe fruits of his labours will be celebrated in upcoming years \u2013 he leaves an exciting artistic programme for both festival and tour through to 2021. We part as friends and esteemed colleagues and wish Sebastian every success with his future.\u201d"
"7||Panorama\u2019s Syria allegations show the UK\u2019s aid needs greater transparencyThe full details of the investigation into aid contractor Adam Smith International in Syria by the BBC\u2019s Panorama are yet to air. But the BBC is claiming that funds meant for the world\u2019s poorest have ended up in the pockets of an extremist group. Adam Smith International strongly denies the allegations contained in the programme and in a separate Times story. The biggest cause for concern would be how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) \u2013 the two bodies responsible for the project funding a civilian police force \u2013 might have allowed this to happen. We urgently need to know exactly when FCO ministers knew of any problems in the project, what their response might have been and if they have identified challenges in other programmes. We should be in no doubt that when it is spent properly, Britain\u2019s aid budget achieves remarkable results. It makes the world safer and fairer, helps to eradicate poverty and disease, makes millions of lives better, and shows the world that Britain stands for something. The Department for International Development (DfID), responsible for the majority of the aid budget, has world-class standards developed over two decades of experience. It is able to ensure that aid is transparent and effective, and that fraud is prevented and managed properly. But since launching its new aid strategy in 2015, this government has actively sought to \u201csecuritise\u201d aid and to increase the use of large private contractors. The government\u2019s strategy explicitly set out to divert our development budget away from DfID and towards other government departments, including the FCO, via the CSSF \u2013 with far lower transparency, effectiveness and fraud prevention standards. New figures released last month shows that 26% of aid funds are now spent outside DfID. In August I wrote to then-secretary of state Priti Patel, recommending seven steps to get a grip on the cross-government aid spending chaos \u2013 all of which were ignored. The Panorama allegations are so alarming precisely because they concern the government\u2019s direction of travel, and exactly the kind of aid project it has pushed to have more of. Unfortunately, the allegations are also likely only the tip of the iceberg. The CSSF operates with very little transparency in 70 countries, including many with questionable human rights records, such as Bahrain, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Yemen. In August, the Guardian reported that through the CSSF, the UK government was funding Egyptian juvenile detention services accused of human rights violations. In April, parliament\u2019s joint committee on the national security strategy \u2013 responsible for oversight of the fund \u2013 had even warned that so little information was available, it was neither able to measure the fund\u2019s impact nor to exercise proper parliamentary scrutiny over it. That must now change. The government must now open up its books on the CSSF and prove that money flowing through it is eradicating poverty rather than violating human rights. That requires a full independent forensic investigation and line-by-line budget review of the fund. The public deserve to understand the full scale of the problem. \u2022 Kate Osamor is the shadow secretary of state for international development"
"1||Kieran Tierney tipped for the top after shining in Europe for CelticKieran Tierney has made a habit of bucking trends. Where emerging youngsters in Scotland would be readily coaxed by the bright lights and brighter pay cheques of the Premier League, Tierney has no such short-term aspiration at all. Attitude and application have denied Scotland a host of footballers who shone in their youth but Tierney displays a level of determination that sets him apart from his peers. When Anderlecht visit Celtic needing to win by three goals or more to knock the home side out of the Europa League qualifying spot on Tuesday, the left-back will be afforded his latest chance to continue a process of learning that has seen scouts line up to file recommendations. Brendan Rodgers provokes smiles with occasional over-praise of individuals but his assessment of Tierney comes without contradiction. The Celtic manager knows a thing or two about the fulfilling of talent having overseen as much during previous coaching spells. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with who I consider to be the two best full-backs in Britain: Danny Rose at Watford and Ryan Bertrand at Chelsea,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cKieran is right up there with those boys. He\u2019s still very young, still has bits of improvement to make but his quality, his will and determination and his focus for a young player is outstanding. This is a young player who can play in the top four of the Premier League if that\u2019s where he wanted to go. \u201cHe\u2019s got an incredible determination, an old-school determination. He lives his life right, he doesn\u2019t drink or do stupid things. He\u2019s in every day training like a dog.\u201d Tierney\u2019s marquee moment, an indication of his approach, did not even arrive during a phase of play. In last May\u2019s Scottish Cup final he was cracked in the face by the elbow of Aberdeen\u2019s Jayden Stockley, leading to a hospital trip and emergency dental surgery for the Celtic player. \u201cI\u2019d have spat my teeth out to play on,\u201d Tierney said. He reappeared at Hampden Park, where he had to negotiate security before bounding up the stairs to join the Scottish Cup victory parade. That Tierney adores Celtic as much as football is clearly useful to the club, who recently gave him a contract to 2023. This love affair is mutual; Celtic\u2019s fans can identify with Tierney, who would not swap his employer for any in world football. Naturally that will change; Tierney\u2019s recent joining of a high-profile management company infers there is knowledge of a pathway to England at some stage. For now, he has captained Celtic without starting 100 league matches. Celtic\u2019s commanding of high fees for Aiden McGeady, Victor Wanyama and Fraser Forster means Tierney will not be coaxed away cheaply. That he represents a nation worryingly unaccustomed to producing blue-chip talent should make no difference on that front. Not only does Tierney barely miss a training session, coaches revel in the fact he approaches each one in the same manner as games. The same applies to opposition; Tierney will treat Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 like a forward at Hamilton Academical which, rather than displaying naivety, illustrates a wonderful unwillingness to cower in the face of reputation. Tierney, like many of his team-mates, endured harrowing evenings in Paris and Munich during this Champions League campaign but he also delivered an outstanding home performance against Bayern that, in spells, visibly impressed Celtic\u2019s German opposition. That Celtic have a highly valuable commodity in Tierney is undeniable. At 20, and without being disparaging towards Andy Robertson, Tierney is superior to his compatriot and fellow left-back who commanded a recent transfer to Liverpool. Therein lies an interesting parallel; whereas Robertson found himself rejected by Celtic and motivated by a hunger to rebuild his career, Tierney benefited from a positional change while in the Scottish champions\u2019 development system. As a left midfield player, Tierney was unlikely to be a Celtic star. He was not, after all, cut from the same winger\u2019s mould as defines so many of the club\u2019s icons. It is testament to Ronny Deila, a Celtic manager under regular pressure, that he not only afforded Tierney a first-team debut at left-back but oversaw the player making that position his own. \u201cKieran can go all the way,\u201d predicted Deila. It has been Rodgers\u2019s task to increase Tierney\u2019s game intelligence and compensate for the player\u2019s one main shortcoming, a lack of height. Tierney is brilliantly powerful to the point where shortcomings are masked, he retains superb tackling skills when one-on-one and has shown a ferocious shot on occasion. Tierney\u2019s versatility has led to him being deployed at centre-half and even right-back, for Scotland, but his future will inevitably be on the left side of defence. It will also, barring something unforeseen and extraordinary, be bright."
"1||He had one jobHOW\u2019S ABOUT CLATTS, THEN? Many are the reasons that have been offered for Leicester\u2019s fairytale run to the Premier League title in 2016: heartwarming team spirit, a charismatic and quirky manager, the goals of Jamie Vardy, the genius of Riyad Mahrez, a lethal counterattacking style opponents recognised but couldn\u2019t cope with, the reward of carb-heavy pizza in exchange for clean sheets, and the strange inability of each and every one of their major rivals to put them under any kind of pressure. But in the time that has elapsed since Wes Morgan hoisted the Premier League trophy skywards to mark the most fitting of ends to the most implausible of feelgood stories, the significant contribution of one man to Leicester\u2019s triumph has been overlooked. A referee as quick to blow his own horn as he is his own whistle, Mark Clattenburg clearly feels he hasn\u2019t got the credit he deserves for almost singlehandedly winning Leicester City the title and has finally stepped forward to explain how it was him wot won it. Now working in a well paid gig as the head of Saudi Arabia\u2019s referees, Clattenburg was in charge of the bad-tempered draw between Chelsea and Tottenham that eliminated Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team from the title race and confirmed Leicester\u2019s ridiculously unlikely status as champions. What\u2019s more, speaking in an interview in the USA! USA!! USA!!!, the famously pleased-with-himself official from Durham has announced he more or less made up the rules as he went along on the evening in question, so nobody could blame him for costing Spurs the title on a night when their players completely lost the plot. \u201cIf I sent three players off from Tottenham, what are the headlines? \u2018Clattenburg cost Tottenham the title,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview with the Men In Blazers podcast. \u201cIt was pure theatre that Tottenham self-destructed against Chelsea and Leicester won the title. Some referees would have played by the book; Tottenham would have been down to seven or eight players and probably lost and they would\u2019ve been looking for an excuse.\u201d So there we have it: he had one job. And the job in question? Maintaining control of a game of football by adhering to assorted laws with which, we must assume considering his lofty status, he is very familiar. And yet rather than enforce them and almost certainly ensure Leicester won the title, he preferred to hope that an out-of-control Tottenham with a full set of players would fare no better than an out-of-control Tottenham that had been correctly reduced to seven or eight players. As luck would have it, Clattenburg\u2019s gamble paid off, neutrals got a rollocking white-knuckle ride and Leicester were crowned champions, but that\u2019s rather beside the point.

"3||Inquiry into social media messages that may identify Jon VenablesThe attorney general\u2019s office has launched an investigation into social media messages which may breach the worldwide legal injunction preventing identification of the convicted child killer Jon Venables. In 1993, Venables and his co-defendant, Robert Thompson, were convicted of killing the two-year-old James Bulger in Liverpool. Before their release on parole in 2001, Venables and Thompson were given new identities, which are supposed to be protected by a court order. The injunction prevents the media or anyone anywhere in the world publishing photographs of them, information that could lead to their being identified or soliciting such information. The fresh inquiry follows previous prosecutions. Four years ago, two men were given suspended prison sentences for posting images on Facebook and Twitter that purported to reveal recent pictures of Venables and Thompson. Breach of the injunction, which is prosecuted as contempt in the high court, carries a sentence of up to two years\u2019 imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. It is an offence to publish images of the two killers even if the images are of a completely different person since that would expose innocent individuals to the dangers of an attack. Venables was recalled to prison last month for the second time after he was suspected of having child abuse images on his computer. There appears to have been a proliferation of messages on multiple social media sites recently giving information that might identify Venables. Confirming the new inquiry, a spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office told the Guardian: \u201cWe have received a complaint that the anonymity order has been breached and we are investigating it.\u201d Other messages on social media appear to give information that might identify the whereabouts of Maxine Carr, the former girlfriend of the Soham murderer, Ian Huntley. The spokesperson for the attorney general\u2019s office added: \u201cWe have not received a complaint that the anonymity order relating to Maxine Carr has been breached. If we do, we will investigate it.\u201d Publication of the images has alarmed officials, who fear they may be used to track down individuals who have been granted anonymity by the courts. Those publishing information seem to be aware in some cases that they are defying the law but persist nonetheless. There is a concern that if the latest breaches are not pursued then the practice could spread to undermining the 1974 Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, under which certain offences no longer need to be disclosed after a set period. About 11 million people have some form of criminal record. The attorney general, Jeremy Wright QC, published a call for evidence earlier this year to assess the impact of social media on criminal cases and establish whether extra reporting restrictions are needed. At the time, he said: \u201cOur contempt of court laws are designed to prevent trial by media. However, are they able to protect against trials by social media? I am looking for expert evidence on whether the increasing influence and ubiquity of social media is having an impact on criminal trials and, if so, whether the criminal justice system has the tools it needs to manage that risk.\u201d"
"4||Yemen Houthi rebels kill former president Ali Abdullah SalehYemen\u2019s civil war has taken a dramatic turn after Iranian-backed Houthi rebels killed the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, punishing him for switching sides and seeking peace with Saudi Arabia. Pictures of Saleh\u2019s corpse appeared on Houthi-run television after the militia said it had killed him as he fled the capital, Sana\u2019a. He had ruled Yemen for more than 30 years and was forced to resign in 2011 as part of the Arab spring political revolution. Houthi military officials said Saleh was killed as he was travelling with other top party leaders from Sana\u2019a to his hometown of Sanhan. Houthi fighters followed him in 20 armoured vehicles, then attacked and killed him and almost all those with him. Gruesome video footage of his blood-spattered body were distributed on social media. Earlier his house was destroyed in fighting that has erupted in Sana\u2019a between Houthi militia and forces loyal to Saleh. Saudi-led coalition warplanes pounded Houthi positions close to the city airport, and the ministry of the interior. The Saudi bombing was part of a desperate and ultimately doomed attempt to prevent the Houthis taking complete control of the capital. Salah\u2019s death may prompt a furious reaction from Saudi Arabia, which is determined to push back Iranian influence in the country. The violence between the Houthis and Saleh\u2019s forces has led so far to the deaths of at least 125 civilians in clashes in the last last five days, according to the International Red Cross. The fresh violence comes after the sudden collapse of the political and military alliance between the Houthi rebels and forces loyal to Saleh. The two groups had held Sana\u2019a for the past three years in an uneasy alliance. The International Red Cross also warned it was struggling to keep the hospital functioning in Sana\u2019a and access its warehouse of medical supplies. The distribution of humanitarian aid across the country is fraught, with 7 million people dependent on aid in what the UN has described as the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disaster. The civil war has so far claimed 10,000 lives. On Saturday, Saleh gave a televised address in effect announcing that he was swapping sides in the civil war, and would be seeking a dialogue with the Saudi and United Arab Emirates-led coalition that he had been fighting, alongside the Houthis, since 2015. The Saudis have sought to reinstall the UN-recognised government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and defeat the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in a Middle East-wide power struggle that has the potential to envelop the whole region in a war. It is widely thought that UAE diplomats persuaded the 75-year-old Saleh to swap sides. \u201cYemeni citizens have tried to tolerate the recklessness of the Houthi over the last two and a half years but cannot any more,\u201d Saleh said in his TV address. He ordered forces loyal to him in the capital to stop taking instructions from the Shia Houthi rebels. The alliance of convenience between Saleh and the Houthis has been close to collapse for months, with claims that Houthis tried to kill Saleh\u2019s son. Hadi also ordered forces loyal to him, mainly based in the southern city of Aden, to capitalise on the disarray in the opposition and advance north to Houthi positions. Hadi\u2019s staff also said they would offer an amnesty to anyone that had collaborated with the Houthi regime. Hours after Saleh\u2019s death, Hadi delivered a televised speech calling for Yemenis to unity against the Houthi rebels, describing them as \u201cIranian militias\u201d and a \u201cnightmare\u201d. It is widely thought that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had been engineering Saleh\u2019s change in allegiance for months after they became disillusioned with Hadi\u2019s leadership, and looked for a new way to break the political and military deadlock. Hadi has been living in exile in Riyadh, and there are reports that he now has little independence from Saudi control. Peter Salisbury, expert on Yemen at the thinktank Chatham House, said: \u201cWith Saleh gone, and no one with whom the Saudis can strike a deal, it is very likely the Saudis will take the gloves off, but the precise extent to which they do so depends very much on what Washington allows them to do. It could get very bloody and messy.\u201d \u201cEveryone has been shocked by the speed with which the Houthis seem to have gained ground in Sana\u2019a, and it has left the Saudis worse off than they were 72 hours ago.\u201d The UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick, called for fighting in Sana\u2019a to pause on Tuesday during daylight hours to allow civilians trapped in their homes to seek food and water. \u201cThe streets of Sana\u2019a city have become battlegrounds and people are trapped in their homes, unable to move out in search of safety and medical care and to access basic supplies such as food, fuel and safe water,\u201d he said in a statement issued from Geneva. Riyadh\u2019s determination to crush the Houthis hardened last month after an Iranian-made missile was fired from Houthi positions at Saudi Arabia\u2019s international airport in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia responded by mounting a three-week blockade of goods entering Houthi-controlled ports, prompting widespread shortages."
"18||Ben Bradlee: the ground-breaking editor who helped bring down NixonA new HBO documentary plays tapes of the president telling his press secretary not to let any Washington Post reporters into the White House from now on, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s a total order and, if necessary, I will fire you.\u201d He goes on to call the newspaper\u2019s editor \u201ca mean bastard\u201d, while the press secretary decries its latest articles as \u201cshoddy journalism\u201d. Just another day in DC? Kind of. The president in question is not Donald Trump, it\u2019s Richard Nixon, the press secretary is Ron Ziegler, the editor is Ben Bradlee and the articles concerned Watergate. Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s deja vu,\u201d said John Maggio, director of the documentary, The Newspaperman: The Life and Times of Ben Bradlee. \u201cThe parallels are astonishing to me.\u201d Maggio had no idea what was around the corner when he started making the film in the summer of 2016, in the heat of the presidential election and two years after Bradlee died in 2014 at 93. \u201cI assumed Hillary Clinton was going to win,\u201d said Maggio. Then Trump became president and his frequent and personalized railing against much of the mainstream media descended into outright feud. Now Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has admitted lying to the FBI and is cooperating with the special investigation into who from the Trump administration and election campaign may have had links with the Russian government. Three days after Flynn appeared in court, Maggio\u2019s documentary will replay scenes of senior Nixon officials facing the music in the political corruption scandal that brought down the president in 1974. \u201cNixon turned the press into the enemy. Watching Trump it\u2019s like, page for page, the Nixon playbook,\u201d Maggio told the Guardian. The documentary is also a reminder that the Watergate catastrophe took two years to play out. Even after the Washington Post had many scoops exposing ever more of the conspiracy and cover-up jigsaw, Nixon won a re-election landslide in 1972. The Newspaperman describes Nixon\u2019s \u201cvendetta\u201d against the Post and plays a tape of Nixon\u2019s right-hand man, Henry Kissinger, saying: \u201cThis Ben Bradlee is a tough, mean cynic.\u201d The president is heard concurring that the editor is \u201ca mean bastard\u201d, and later calls the Post\u2019s reporting \u201coutrageous, distorted\u201d and \u201chysterical\u201d. But Bradlee\u2019s third wife, Sally Quinn, told the Guardian: \u201cHe never went after Nixon personally, it wasn\u2019t personal for Ben.\u201d Bradlee\u2019s voice is heard throughout the documentary reading the audio version of his memoir. \u201cThe air was thick with lies and the president was the chief liar,\u201d says Bradlee\u2019s voiceover, of Nixon. Quinn\u2019s favorite adjective for Bradlee is \u201cswashbuckling\u201d. Senior journalists describe him as fearless. His sense of invincibility was forged while battling to recover from polio as a teenager, then serving as a young officer in the South Pacific during the second world war. A documentary about a newspaper editor always risks boring viewers with journalism\u2019s equivalent of inside baseball, no matter his charisma and track record. But not when this is the real life version of Hollywood\u2019s All the President\u2019s Men, which dramatized the Post\u2019s exposure of the Watergate debacle and made Bradlee, as the documentary says, the \u201cfirst celebrity editor\u201d. And the early part of the film is filled with sumptuous archive footage of Bradlee and his second wife Antoinette, AKA Tony, hanging out socially with John and Jackie Kennedy. Riveting shots show the handsome four larking around on golf carts and sipping summer cocktails on yachts in the blue, blue waters off New England. It\u2019s always undeniably mesmerizing to watch the unwitting JFK, us knowing that his mischievous grin and magnetism are about to be snuffed out with his 1963 assassination. Here, there\u2019s extra fascination, also unsettling, as your attention is drawn away from the electric Kennedys to Ben and Tony, right by their side. Bradlee worked for Newsweek at the time but ended up in JFK\u2019s inner, inner circle, where the line between friend and journalist blurred. Ben and Tony would dine at the White House and Bradlee would sometimes fly with the president. \u201cIt was inappropriate and he was driving his Time competitors crazy,\u201d NBC veteran Tom Brokaw comments. Tina Brown, former New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Daily Beast editor, says of JFK and Bradlee, both sons of Boston: \u201cThey were brothers in style. If Ben Bradlee had been a politician he would have been a Kennedy.\u201d The film charts Bradlee\u2019s discovery of his wild side as a glamorous foreign correspondent for Newsweek in Paris in the 50s. Over footage of skiing in the Alps and gossipy parties, Bradlee unabashedly describes cheating on his first wife, then leaving her, acting with \u201crecklessness and thoughtlessness\u201d and causing misery for his seven-year-old son. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever had a moment of guilt in his life, honestly,\u201d says Sally Quinn on camera. When publisher Katherine Graham appointed Bradlee executive editor of the Washington Post in 1968, \u201cit was a second-rate provincial newspaper,\u201d veteran Washington Post journalist Robert Kaiser says in the film. Bradlee began turning it into a national contender. But he reveals being sick to his stomach when the pre-eminent New York Times beat him with its Pentagon Papers mega-scoop in 1971 \u2013 thousands of leaked classified documents showing the government had lied about how badly the Vietnam war was going in the mid-60s, and covering up bombing campaigns in Cambodia and Laos. After the government won an injunction to block further publication on the grounds of national security, Bradlee and Graham, against legal advice, went to court and triumphed in a landmark supreme court victory for freedom of the press under the first amendment. Stills in the film show the two practically jumping for joy as they can begin publishing new excerpts in their newspaper. \u201cNational security wasn\u2019t the issue, national embarrassment was the issue!\u201d PBS journalist Jim Lehrer scoffs at the White House. A Steven Spielberg dramatization of the battle, called The Post, hits the big screen in December. \u201cThe first amendment was Ben\u2019s religion,\u201d Quinn said. The documentary cites the Pentagon Papers triumph in the emboldening of the Post team that later doggedly and audaciously pursued their Watergate coverage, while other papers held back and the White House exerted ferocious pressure. Star reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reminisce fondly about the irascible Bradlee\u2019s habitual yelling and profanity as he drove them onward. But the film also alludes to hubris at the paper in the years that followed, which ultimately contributed to the fiasco of the Post publishing a fake story about a child heroin addict. Upon discovering it had been duped by its own reporter, the Post handed back the 1981 Pulitzer Prize. Bradlee then made the unconventional decision to publish a forensic, 18,000-word mea culpa and analysis of the catastrophe. \u201cThis became the template for what you do when you screw up,\u201d says New Yorker editor David Remnick. Bradlee retired from the Washington Post in 1991, which seems an awfully long time ago now. Yet his battles are still being fought in principle, and his mantras are evergreen. With Bradlee under siege over Watergate, he says, simply: \u201cWe hunker down and go about our business, which is not to be loved but to go after the truth.\u201d Deja vu. The Newspaperman: The Life and Times of Ben Bradlee airs on HBO on 4 December at 8pm"
"26||How the Winklevoss twins became the world\u2019s first bitcoin billionairesName: Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Also known as: The Winklevii. Age: 36 and 36. Appearance: Handsome, enormous, similar. Because they\u2019re identical twins? Yup. You might remember them from The Social Network in 2010. Vaguely. So they\u2019re actors, are they? No. They\u2019re venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. In 2008, they rowed for the US at the Beijing Olympics, finishing sixth. In the film, Armie Hammer played both of them as a kind of two-man master race. As one of them put it in a memorable line of dialogue, \u201cI\u2019m 6ft 5, 220 pounds and there\u2019s two of me.\u201d Nice. But why make a film about them? Because they were at Harvard with Mark Zuckerberg, who they later sued, claiming he stole their idea for a website that they called Harvard Connection, but which he called the Facebook. (Dramatic music.) And did he? Steal the idea, I mean? Oh, God, that\u2019s just too complicated to get into. The Winklevii launched numerous lawsuits about it, and got about $65m (\u00a348m) worth of Facebook stock, which wasn\u2019t much at the time. Oh, yeah. Sure. These guys probably spend $65m on lunch. In fact, they spent $11m of it on bitcoin, so they\u2019ve probably cheered up a bit. Bitcoin. There\u2019s a word I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s a crypto-currency. There\u2019s another one. Think of it as an electronic token, which can be owned and traded. Like normal money, it has value because other people consider it valuable. The number of bitcoins in circulation is strictly controlled by a clever bit of software that nobody can hack, called the blockchain. Thank you. And the Winklevoss twins like having lots of bitcoins, do they? I\u2019m sure they do at the moment. In March 2013, they bought about 100,000 of them, when each coin was worth roughly $120. After a strong year, and a wild couple of weeks, each bitcoin is now worth \u2026 let\u2019s see \u2026 $11,826. Holy moly! That\u2019s right. Not counting the value of their other investments, the Winklevoss twins have just become the world\u2019s first bitcoin billionaires. Apart from Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin\u2019s mysterious inventor, of course. Please don\u2019t explain who he is. Well, there are lots of intriguing theories \u2026 Do say: \u201cThey\u2019re not billionaires \u2013 they\u2019re half a billionaire each!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cJust $73bn to go and they\u2019ll catch up with Zuckerberg.\u201d"
"20||MPs demand Whirlpool explain end to dryer replacement schemeMPs have demanded to know why home appliances provider Whirlpool has ended a product replacement scheme for defective products when there are still more than 1 million potentially deadly tumble dryers remaining in British households. The decision follows last week\u2019s announcement that Whirlpool is the \u2018worst offender\u2019 for white goods fires in London. The tumble dryers, sold under the Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit brands, have been blamed for a number of UK fires, including one in a London tower block and a blaze in Wales where two men died. Rachel Reeves, chair of the Commons committee on business, energy and ndustrial strategy, accused the US firm of \u201cfalling significantly short of their responsibilities\u201d amid continuing concerns about the safety of the dryers. In a letter to Whirlpool UK\u2019s head of communications, Ian Moverley, she demanded to know why he failed to mention the replacement scheme was closing when he gave evidence to the committee in October. \u201cWhy did you not mention this when you gave evidence to the committee at the end of October?\u201d Reeves wrote. \u201cPlease can you explain why you decided to end this scheme when there are one million defective tumble dryers still being used in households across the UK?\u201d Moverley was unable to answer a series of questions from MPs during the session on 31 October and agreed to supply the committee with additional information after the hearing. The replacement scheme gave consumers the choice to buy a new machine for around \u00a350, well below market value, rather than wait for them to be modified. Whirlpool has said that its decision to withdraw the scheme was down to lack of demand. Reeves added: \u201cFor Whirlpool to stop their replacement scheme of their tumble dryers due to a \u2018fall in demand\u2019 while 1 million customers still have these faulty appliances in their homes suggests a company falling significantly short of their responsibilities to consumer safety.\u201d It has been reported that customers are desperate to replace their potentially dangerous dryers that risk catching fire when fluff touches the heating element. Whirlpool had previously identified a fire risk with two models of tumble dryers manufactured between 2004 and 2015. The company initially advised consumers the machines were safe to use with precautions while awaiting repair, before stating in February that the dryers should be unplugged until the repairs were done. Last month, a coroner called on Whirlpool to take action to prevent future deaths after an electrical fault in the door of one of its dryers was blamed for a fire which killed two men in a flat in Llanrwst, north Wales, in October 2014. An Indesit model also caused a serious fire in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, west London, leading to the evacuation of more than 100 families. Twenty-five households were temporarily accommodated in hotels due to the extent of the damage. The company conceded that informing the owners of the remaining faulty machines \u2013 estimated to be around 3.8 million \u2013 had been difficult, despite doubling the number of their call centres. Whirlpool later said in a statement that it was still appealing to remaining owners of the affected models to get in contact so the dryers could be modified for free. \u201cAfter two years of extensive measures to raise awareness, the number of consumers coming forward has now fallen sharply. This suggests that few affected appliances remain in service,\u201d it said. \u201cWe wish to remind consumers that if they still own one of these appliances, it is never too late to get in touch.\u201d It said anyone who owned an Indesit, Hotpoint, Creda, Swan or Proline dryer made between April 2004 and September 2015 could visit https://safety.indesit.eu/, https://safety.hotpoint.eu/ or https://safety-swan.eu to find out if their model was affected. UK consumers could also call Whirlpool\u2019s freephone helpline on 0800 1510905."
"7||Labour\u2019s poll lead shows the next election is there for the takingThis time last year, Labour languished 15 points behind the Tories. This weekend, the latest Survation poll puts Labour eight points ahead, ending what seemed an impossible impasse. It\u2019s good news \u2013 for Labour, for anyone who wants to avoid hard Brexit, for those of us angered by a government willing to pander to Trump and extremism and for millions who have suffered the sharp consequences of a brutal, ideological assault on public spending in recent years. Opinion polls only ever provide a snapshot, but in doorstep conversations across the country, it feels increasingly that Labour has two key assets any aspiring government needs. We face a weak, divided government that, reminiscent of the Major years, has lost both authority and purpose. Theresa May\u2019s shambolic, exhausted Tories have seen their unifying argument \u2013 that austerity is inevitable \u2013 destroyed by a willingness to throw money at the DUP while continuing to starve the police, the NHS and social care of the funding it badly needs. A prime minister who only a year ago seemed strong now appears arrogant. Taking for granted the support of Tory remainers, older voters and swaths of the north, her manifesto\u2019s draconian policies on social care and foxhunting reminded wavering voters that the nasty party was back. The reluctance to step in and help Manchester after a brutal terrorist attack on young families, contrasted unfavourably even with the Major\u2019s government which came quickly after the 1996 bombing to offer help to rebuild. Just as in 1996, the energy lies with Labour. The 2017 election galvanised the party, from the leadership to the grassroots, to turn outwards to the country with energy, clarity of purpose and a story to tell about the future that has been missing from progressive politics for most of my adult lifetime. The 2017 manifesto, despite its flaws, was the first Labour manifesto in decades to explain not just what, but why. As George Monbiot argues compellingly in his new book Out of the Wreckage, the strength of the neoliberal project is the clarity of its story; an overbearing state standing in the way of the enterprise and endeavour of millions of individuals. To tear it down without anything in its place is hopelessly inadequate. Now, at last, we have begun to tell a story of collective endeavour and hope, embodied for many first-time voters by Jeremy Corbyn, echoing the \u201cBernie Sanders effect\u201d in the US. But, as in the US, one great challenge for Labour remains. In its 2017 general election report, the New Economics Foundation found that Labour made its biggest strides in areas of economic growth while strikingly, after seven years of austerity, the Tories made their largest gains in areas of economic decline. It suggests that the keys to No 10 lie not in the cities where for many a sense of optimism persists and Labour is weighing in votes, but in towns across the country where people who have little hope for the future look to British politics and still find none. That is our job now, in towns across Britain, to make hope plausible or risk seeing a significant poll lead tragically fail to translate into a parliamentary majority. Research from the Centre for Towns, a new thinktank we launched last month, found that a little over 30,000 voters living in 46 town constituencies across the country could have put Labour into power. But in those areas, despite the attraction of a Labour party that has rediscovered its ambition, too many people still believe that those ambitious plans will come at huge cost to themselves. To turn this around will demand of us not just the courage of our convictions, but the energy, creativity, detailed work and hard choices on jobs, wages, public services, global security and climate change that proves to these voters that we can be trusted again. This weekend\u2019s poll proves that the next election is there for the taking. But now is not the time to celebrate; now is the time to think. \u2022 Lisa Nandy is Labour MP for Wigan"
"21||Bollywood star Shashi Kapoor dies aged 79Veteran Indian film industry stalwart Shashi Kapoor has died at the age of 79, it has been confirmed. His nephew Randhir told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that the actor had died in Mumbai on Monday after several years of kidney problems. Kapoor was a scion of the celebrated Indian film-making dynasty, the son of Mughal-E-Azam star Prithviraj Kapoor, and brother of Raj Kapoor. Shashi Kapoor\u2019s own screen career started as a child actor in the 1940s and 50s, appearing in films such as Aag and Awaara, in both of which he played the younger version of his already established brother Raj. His first leading role was in the award-winning 1961 Dharmputra, directed by Yash Chopra, which was one of the first Indian features to deal with partition. A series of hits in the 1970s, including Jaanwar Aur Insaan (1972), Kabhi Kabhie (1976) and Trishna (1979), saw him become a major star alongside the likes of Amitabh Bachchan, with whom he co-starrred in Kabhi Kabhie as well as Trishul (1978) and Kaala Patthar (1979). Having married actor Jennifer Kendal in 1958, Kapoor became part of the Merchant Ivory stable of English-language films set in India, starring opposite Kendal in Bombay Talkie (1970) and Merchant Ivory\u2019s 1982 hit Heat and Dust. He also appeared with his sister-in-law Felicity Kendal in 1965\u2019s Shakespeare Wallah. Kapoor cut back his acting work in the mid-1980s after the death of Jennifer from cancer in 1984, though he did appear in Ismail Merchant\u2019s directorial debut In Custody in 1993. He is survived by two sons Kunal and Karan, and a daughter Sanjana."
"26||Facebook launches Messenger Kids app \u2013 but parents vet chat contactsFacebook is launching a new version of its chat app targeting children under 13 with strict parental controls including contact approvals. The free app, called Messenger Kids, hopes to attract parents looking for a safe online chat service, with a greater level of parental control, child-friendly features, screened content and safety filters to prevent children sharing inappropriate content. Messenger Kids is a standalone app installed on the child\u2019s tablet or smartphone, but controlled from a parent\u2019s Facebook account. The child does not have a Facebook account, which is prohibited for those under 13; instead the app operates as an extension of the parent\u2019s account. Only parents have the ability to add friends or delete messages. There are no adverts or in-app purchases and the social network said the child\u2019s information will not be used for advertising purposes. Facebook also said it will not automatically move users to the regular Messenger or Facebook when they get old enough, though the company may provide them the option to move contacts to Messenger down the line. Loren Cheng, a product management director at Facebook, said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s using video chat to talk to grandparents, staying in touch with cousins who live far away, or sending mom a decorated photo while she\u2019s working late to say hi, Messenger Kids opens up a new world of online communication to families.\u201d Children can start one-on-one or group video or text chats with approved contacts, sending videos, photos, gifs and other creative elements from a library of screened drawing tools, frames, gifs, masks and stickers. Facebook also said that it will block children from sharing nudity, sexual or violent content, and have a dedicated moderation team to respond to flagged content. Messages sent to adults or those over 13 appear in their normal Facebook Messenger app. Parents control contacts and other options through their Facebook app on their smartphone. The app, which is rolling out as a preview to iOS with Android coming later, is only available in the US for the timebeing. Facebook said it was fully compliant with the US Children\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act, and that it had worked with online safety experts including the National PTA and Blue Star Families. Kristelle Lavallee, a children\u2019s psychology expert and content strategist at the Center on Media and Child Health at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and Harvard University, worked with Facebook to develop the app. She said: \u201cThe risk of exposure to things [children] were not developmentally prepared for is huge.\u201d Facebook Messenger Kids \u201cmakes parents the gatekeepers\u201d and was designed \u201cwith the best of intentions\u201d, Lavallee said. How \u2013 and if \u2013 the app ends up getting used remains to be seen. Despite US federal law prohibiting companies from collecting personal information on those under 13 years old without parental consent, millions are already on Facebook, with or without their parents\u2019 permission, says Stephen Balkam, chief executive of the nonprofit Family Online Safety Institute. He said Facebook is trying to deal with the situation pragmatically by steering young Facebook users to a service designed for them. Messenger Kids offers an opportunity to introduce children to the wider Facebook ecosystem, fending off advances from rivals targeting children and teenagers, while locking parents and family into the social network to communicate with their children.

"22||If babies can share, why can\u2019t highly paid university vice-chancellors?Have you ever distributed sweets or toys among children? I have always found you have to be scrupulously fair or you won\u2019t have a harmonious tea party or sleepover. If you gave one child 20 sweeties and the others only one each, there would be uproar because most children are sticklers for fairness. When kids are only about 14 months old, they display spontaneous, unrewarded helping behaviour. By the time they are seven or eight, they like to share things and care for others\u2019 wellbeing. Even babies are disturbed by injustice. Isn\u2019t that lovely? We start off caring and sharing. But then something goes horribly wrong. Altruism often seems to go down the plughole. Why? I can\u2019t work it out. If a baby can share, and so can bonobos, why not a university vice-chancellor? It can\u2019t be that difficult. On telly last week, I saw the vice-chancellor of the University of Bath (who requested \u00a32 expenses for biscuits) saying calmly that she was not embarrassed by her whacking great salary, even though non-managerial university staff have their pay rises capped at 1.1%. I had a pointless little scream at the telly, punched the sofa and frightened the dog, as I find this sort of thing disturbing. What do vice-chancellors do that makes them worth half the Royal Mint? OK, they are leaders of executive teams, but they are also meant to be symbolic leaders, with ideals. University bosses, along with others at the top of the pile, seem to be leading us into a grownup version of a children\u2019s unfair tea party from hell. What\u2019s more, unfairness can cause stress, anxiety, poor health, shorter lives, higher infant mortality, obesity and crime \u2013 as well as lower scores in maths, reading and science, according to the Equality Trust. Which is not ideal. And so I was thrilled to find that I am not alone in my boiling fury about unfairness.

"2||England left \u2018pretty frustrated\u2019 by batting collapse, says Jimmy AndersonJimmy Anderson admitted to there being \u201csome pretty frustrated players\u201d in the England dressing room after a collapse with the bat on the third day in Adelaide, followed by a late surge of wickets with the ball, left a lingering sense of what could have been for the tourists. Bowled out for a meek 227 in response to Australia\u2019s first innings 442 for eight declared, Joe Root\u2019s side were not asked to follow on by Steve Smith. They responded by reducing the hosts to 53 for four under lights, with two wickets apiece for Anderson and Chris Woakes. But with Australia leading by 268 runs going into day four, England were still staring at the prospect of going 2-0 down in their Ashes defence before the third Test in Perth, where they have not won since 1978. For their record-wicket-taker, the last man out as Craig Overton top-scored from No9 with an unbeaten 41, it was galling. \u201cWe should have got more runs,\u201d said Anderson, who went on to pick up two for 16 with the ball. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some very frustrated players in the dressing room. All we can do as bowlers is try our best, and that\u2019s what we did. We gave it absolutely everything.\u201d Smith\u2019s decision not to enforce the follow-on, and offer England\u2019s attack a chance to redeem their performance from the first innings after dark, was controversial despite their holding the whip hand. Mitchell Starc, who earlier claimed three for 49, distanced himself from the call. \u201cWe didn\u2019t tonight, he\u2019s the captain and he makes the decisions\u201d replied Starc, when asked if Smith had consulted his seemingly still fresh attack. \u201cWe had a tough session with the bat but there\u2019s a lot of cricket to go. But in terms of the follow-on, it\u2019s all up to Smithy.\u201d Starc revealed Australia\u2019s bowlers had learned how best to use the pitch when watching England\u2019s attack bowl too short in their first innings. Though remedied in their late burst, which saw Woakes claim the key wicket of Smith lbw for six, Root\u2019s side must be kicking themselves. On Overton, with whom he shared a stand of 66 that likely altered Smith\u2019s plans to bowl again, Woakes said: \u201cI thought he batted beautifully on debut. He was getting plenty of verbals, as you would expect, and plenty of short stuff. I was pretty annoyed with the way I got out [caught and bowled by Starc on 33], I feel I probably left a few runs out there. \u201cWe\u2019re behind in the game, but we\u2019ve fought back and shown some good character and put some pressure back on Australia. I think that\u2019s really important.\u201d"
"13||How to eat like a world leader: from Trump\u2019s Big Macs to Thatcher\u2019s Bovril toastIt may come as little surprise to learn that what goes into Donald Trump\u2019s mouth is roughly as wholesome as what comes out of it. On his campaign plane, the now 71-year-old president ate meals representing \u201cfour major food groups\u201d, according to a new book written by two former staffers: \u201cMcDonald\u2019s, KFC, pizza and Diet Coke.\u201d And he didn\u2019t hold back within each group; on the ground at McDonald\u2019s, Trump\u2019s standard order was two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fishes and a chocolate milkshake, his campaign managers Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, added. Trump may one day count himself lucky that he will never have to rely on the Affordable Care Act, but he would not be the first world leader with peculiar, or even prodigious, dietary requirements. Bill Clinton The 1990s president was famous for pausing runs with his security guards to dive into McDonald\u2019s. At a New Hampshire campaign event, an aide reportedly had to stop Clinton from devouring a box of a dozen donuts like a starved pelican. A quadruple bypass and two stents later, a ballooning Bill went vegan on doctors\u2019 orders. Silvio Berlusconi There is patriotism in Trump\u2019s favoured food brands, but Berlusconi took nationalist eating to new levels with a \u201ctricolore menu\u201d. According to associates, the disgraced former Italian prime minister held lavish banquets at which all food had to be red, green and white. Think three pastas with tomato, basil or cheese sauces, or roast beef with mashed potatoes and salad leaves. He later became a vegetarian, only then to be seen this year reading a menu in McDonald\u2019s. Margaret Thatcher The Iron Lady had simple tastes in the kitchen, where she insisted on doing her own cooking, often for cabinet colleagues. Eggs featured heavily \u2013 usually boiled or poached and laid on Bovril toast \u2013 in a high-protein diet before that became a thing. While she campaigned to become prime minister, Maggie reportedly ate 28 eggs per week, occasionally with steak, salad and a drop of whisky. Winston Churchill Never in the field of political eating was so much served on a plate to one prime minister. Churchill\u2019s diet read like a manifesto for gout: cigars for breakfast; a morning \u201cmouthwash\u201d of whisky and soda; oysters, hams and assorted game. All of it washed down with sherry, cognac, port, brandy and, over a lifetime of vegetable-free excess, an estimated 42,000 bottles of Pol Roger."

"17||Milein Cosman obituaryMilein Cosman, who has died aged 96, drew many of the greatest artistic names of the 20th century. Working on commission for publishers, magazines and newspapers, she sketched Benjamin Britten, Yehudi Menuhin, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Sir Thomas Beecham, TS Eliot, Francis Bacon, Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore, among others. She drew primarily from life, and her subjects were mostly artists of various kinds, and above all musicians. Into this she was led by a love of music, but also by her almost 40-year-long collaboration with her Viennese husband, the musician, musicologist and broadcaster Hans Keller. Their book Stravinsky at Rehearsal (1962), which combined his words with her drawings, is a classic of a genre they largely devised themselves; he analysed the music, while she captured the musicians in the midst of its creation. Cosman worked in ink, pencil and cont\u00e9, and was never inhibited by the fame of her subjects: she drew Thomas Mann while he was lecturing; Sir Arthur Bliss conducting and John Ogdon at the piano. She worked extraordinarily swiftly, saying: \u201cI can only draw fast. If I draw slowly, I almost always get it wrong. I think all the Stravinsky sketches were done in one day.\u201d She also did many paintings, subjects including Stravinsky and Mstislav Rostropovich, the artist Fred Uhlman, and, most often, Keller. In his appreciation of Milein\u2019s work, published in the catalogue of her show of drawings and prints at the Belgrave Gallery in 1996, Sir Ernst Gombrich commented: \u201cPosterity will be grateful to Milein Cosman above all for the sureness of her eye, with which she has succeeded in capturing the unique quality of so many of our distinguished contemporaries.\u201d She claimed, however, that: \u201cWhat I really like to draw best are people who work: fishermen and road menders. Yes, it must be said, that really a lot of people have quite wonderful faces.\u201d Emilie Cosmann (her brother nicknamed her \u201cMilein\u201d and she dropped the last letter of her surname when she came to Britain) was born into a comfortable German-Jewish family in the small town of Gotha, in Germany. She was educated largely in D\u00fcsseldorf, where she organised a pupils\u2019 anti-fascist group and for her last two school years attended the Ecole d\u2019Humanit\u00e9 and the International School in Geneva. In 1939 she followed her brother, who was already installed in Scotland, to Britain. Thereafter, Milein always referred to herself as an \u00e9migr\u00e9e rather than a refugee. Refugee was not the only label she refused to accept. \u201cI\u2019m not religious, I was brought up without religion, my religion is the arts,\u201d she said, and: \u201cI am not a \u2018Jewish\u2019 artist.\u201d After she gained entry to the Slade School of Fine Art \u2013 by turning up in person with her portfolio \u2013 she lived in a leaky garret behind the Ashmolean museum, Oxford, where the Slade was evacuated for the duration of the war. She studied drawing under Randolph Schwabe and lithography with Harold Jones, and in 1943 she alternated evening classes with Bernard Meninsky at Oxford Polytecnic with giving art classes for the Workers\u2019 Educational Association. She supported herself by delivering milk with a pony and trap and teaching French at a convent school. It was at Oxford, too, that she met Iris Murdoch, then a student, and was invited back for \u201ccocoa at Somerville\u201d after an evening lecture given by Graham Sutherland. Milein drew Murdoch\u2019s portrait, commenting on the sharp features in the baby face, and the acute intelligence they revealed. This was the first lithograph Milein made, and demonstrated her ability to get under the skin of her subjects, to perceive more than perhaps they were aware of exposing. While at Oxford, she met a constellation of musicians, artists and writers. The poet Sidney Keyes fell in love with her and dedicated some of his work to her. He was not the last poet to be struck by the tiny, lively-minded woman with birdlike movements and sharp intelligence. Years later, Dannie Abse was so impressed by a chance encounter in Zwemmer\u2019s bookshop that he followed her all the way up the Charing Cross Road to pursue their conversation. Milein moved to London at the end of the war, where she worked as an illustrator and began to submit sketches to magazines and newspapers. She became a regular contributor to the Radio Times, supplying portraits of the next week\u2019s interviewees. Of Imogen Holst she said: \u201cShe looked quite funny, you know, in her sandals and ankle socks. She had the face of a Flemish Madonna.\u201d Sometimes she generalised: \u201cI find on the whole women quite difficult to do. They often have softer features \u2013 and very few of them are conductors\u201d; of the cellist Rostropovich, she said: \u201cHe was marvellous to draw, as I believe cellists almost always are, crawling all over their instruments like beetles.\u201d In 1947, while working on a commission, she met Keller, who became her most frequent subject; his keenly angular, impish face adorned the small spaces of wall between the vast living-room windows of the Hampstead house which they bought in the 1960s, and where Milein stayed on alone after his death in 1985. With its unfolding rooms \u2013 French windows and a kitchen verandah giving on to a long front garden scattered with fruit trees \u2013 it had a German ambience often enhanced by the aroma of fresh poppyseed cake wafting through the open-plan modernist interior. In 1958 Milein worked on a schools\u2019 television series about drawing for ITV and in the 60s she joined Camden Printmakers, participating in numerous group shows. Her work was acquired by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Jewish Museum in London, and internationally by the universities of Texas, Pennsylvania, McMaster, Canada and Kanagawa, Tokyo. Her cousin Leo Goldschmidt established the permanent exhibition of her work in the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, where he was the director, and there is another at Milein\u2019s beloved Wigmore Hall, where she was a regular attender. In 1986 Milein\u2019s illustrations appeared in Klemperer on Music, and in 1998, in the John Heath-Stubbs 80th birthday issue of Aquarius. As a sideline she devised a series of animals to which she added ludic descriptions: a Bird Flautist, Dancing Kangaroos, Dream Camels. She drew Britten\u2019s parrot, for which she had to obtain not only Britten\u2019s permission, but also that of his ill-tempered housekeeper, Miss Hudson, for access to \u201cher\u201d kitchen. In 2006 she established the Cosman Keller Art and Music Trust to support education in these fields, and to preserve her work and that of her husband. It has recently bequeathed her drawings and prints of musicians to the Royal College of Music in London, drawings and prints of dancers to Salzburg University and a selection of drawings and prints to the arts academy in Berlin. Despite encroaching blindness from the 90s onwards and a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s in 2011, Milein carried on working for as long as she could. In 2014 she attended the opening of a major retrospective of her work in Gotha, and a documentary on her life, directed by Christoph B\u00f6ll, was funded by the city. An exhibition of her work is due to be held at Clare Hall, Cambridge, in 2019. As she said, swiftly sketching a young child who came to her annual apple-picking party in 2003: \u201cThere\u2019s always the thrill of the ink and the pen on the page.\u201d Then, cocking her head to peer at what she\u2019d just done: \u201cIt is a good drawing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Milein is survived by three nieces and a nephew. \u2022 Milein Cosman, artist, born 31 March 1921; died 21 November 2017"
"5||Gucci confirms its offices were raided over suspected tax evasionThe Italian fashion house Gucci has confirmed that its offices in Milan and Florence were raided last week over suspected tax evasion. The company, which is owned by the French luxury group Kering, was forced to issue a statement after the Italian newspaper La Stampa reported on Saturday that police had spent three days searching the offices, including its new Milan headquarters, for evidence amid suspicions that levies on profits made from sales in Italy were instead declared in the more favourable tax regime of Switzerland. By doing so, prosecutors suspect that the 96-year-old brand, which is enjoying a phenomenal revival, managed to save \u20ac1.3bn (\u00a31.1bn) in domestic tax over several years. The company said it was \u201cproviding its full cooperation to the respective authorities and is confident about the correctness and transparency of its operations\u201d. \u201cThe company has a complex group structure, in which the trademark and royalties and a lot of other costs are paid abroad,\u201d Angelo Cremonese, an economics and finance professor at Rome\u2019s Luiss University, said. \u201cIt has a Switzerland entity which the tax authorities suspect is an Italian company for tax purposes.\u201d Gucci, whose sales growth surged 49.4% in the third quarter of this year, is the latest fashion house to come under the spotlight of the Italian taxman as part of the country\u2019s aim to claw back more than \u20ac100bn estimated to be lost to tax fraud each year. A series of investigations began in 2014, with a probe into Prada\u2019s decade-long tax avoidance totalling \u20ac470m being among the most high-profile. Chief executive Miuccia Prada and her husband and joint chief executive Patrizio Bertelli later paid an estimated \u20ac420m in a settlement. Giorgio Armani was also forced to pay \u20ac270m in 2014 over a tax dispute involving overseas subsidiaries. Meanwhile in the same year, fraud convictions against Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, the celebrated founders of Dolce &amp; Gabbana who had been facing jail for allegedly avoiding paying \u20ac1bn, were overturned. Since then, tax authorities have homed in on the tech giants, with Apple agreeing to pay a \u20ac318m fine in 2015 after its Italy unit allegedly failed to declare taxes totalling \u20ac880m between 2008 and 2013. Earlier this year Google settled a \u20ac306m tax dispute, while probes into Amazon and Facebook are ongoing. The investigations are reaping some success, with the Italian Revenue Agency saying in April that it had recovered \u20ac19bn in unpaid taxes in 2016, a 28% increase on the \u20ac14.9bn retrieved in 2015 and more than triple the \u20ac6.4bn recovered a decade ago. The bulk of the money (\u20ac10.5bn) recovered last year came from tax checks conducted by the agency, while the rest came from settlements or spontaneous payments. The government is also preparing to introduce a so-called \u201cweb tax\u201d on digital sales, which will hit tech giants and is expected to bring in an extra \u20ac114m a year. Much of the success in recuperating taxes in recent years has been due to voluntary disclosures courtesy of an information sharing-agreement struck between Italy, Switzerland and other tax havens, added Cremonese. \u201cIf people or companies with money abroad don\u2019t make a declaration, then Switzerland and other tax havens let the Italian government know.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."
"1||Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s brings life to Getafe as intense approach reaps rewards\u201cHe calls in the defenders first: breaks a TV. He calls in the midfielders and he breaks a light. Calls in the strikers, breaks a sofa.\u201d One of Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s former players tells the tale and, although he\u2019s laughing, he\u2019s only half joking. The Getafe manager began his coaching career in the third division nearly 24 years ago and there are other moments like it, not far beneath the carefully-cultivated impeccable appearance, breaking beyond the tidy beard and smart glasses: benches have borne witness, press rooms too, and that\u2019s just the public displays. There have been fridges kicked and doors punched, tactics boards butted. \u201cHe has his foot up against your throat and doesn\u2019t let go,\u201d says Juan Cala. The Getafe defender means it figuratively of course, but another says: \u201cYou sometimes wonder if he\u2019s going to hit you.\u201d That player recalls Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s assistant chasing a team-mate around the training pitch, saying things, trying to wind him up. Before a game, a long time ago now, Bordal\u00e1s made another hold a pencil between his nose and top lip, and cross his eyes. Now stay like that, he told him. He wanted them to go on the pitch wearing a \u201ccrazy face\u201d to \u201cterrify opponents\u201d. Defenders were told to grab strikers, fight them. Every ball is a battle. \u201cYou spend the week building to the game, all week. And every game it\u2019s like you\u2019re playing for your life; if you don\u2019t win it\u2019s an absolute disaster,\u201d Cala says. Another footballer calls him \u201ca bit peculiar\u201d, but he\u2019s certainly not stupid. Asked to define him in a phrase, here\u2019s an answer: \u201cVery, very, very intelligent.\u201d As for Cala, he defines Bordal\u00e1s in a single word: rendimiento. Performance. There is something about him that gets the best out of them. Look at the table and there are Madrid\u2019s \u201cother\u201d teams. Legan\u00e9s, coached by Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s one-time assistant Asier Garitano, sit seventh. And, less than three miles from there across the motorway, Getafe are eighth. They sit one and two points off a European place, respectively. So what? So these are clubs whose derby was traditionally played in the third tier, whose only objective is survival, and who arguably shouldn\u2019t even be here at all. A little over a year ago, Legan\u00e9s were a single place off the relegation zone. Getafe, meanwhile, were second bottom. Of the second division. That was when they turned to Bordal\u00e1s. Getafe had recovered a little but seven weeks in they still sat 21st. They were about to become Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s 11th club as a coach and none had been in the first division, which wasn\u2019t his place \u2013 or so it seemed. A technical striker nicknamed \u2018the Roman\u2019 who retired early because of a knee injury, having been at 11 clubs and never above the third division, he spent most of his coaching career there, working around his native Alicante (where he managed three times), until he moved to Alcorc\u00f3n. With them, he reached the play-offs to primera in 2012-13 and in 2015-16 he brought Alav\u00e9s up as champions. The problem was that he didn\u2019t get to go up with them, the job instead given to Mauricio Pellegrino \u2013 a decision which seemed to say something about him but might have said just as much about prejudice. In truth, it was as much about tension between him and the board but it also tapped into the idea that, somehow, he was fine for the second division but couldn\u2019t do what he did in the first. The decision, as it turned out, was good for Alav\u00e9s \u2013 they finished ninth and reached the Copa del Rey final \u2013 and even better for Getafe. In the autumn, posters started appearing in Getafe showing Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s face with the slogan \u201ctake me to primera\u201d, and he did. A second promotion in a row, with a second club. Yet, ridiculous though it sounds, some wondered if he might face a second sacking. There were still doubts about his continuity, Getafe\u2019s president \u00c1ngel Torres cornered on camera and pretty much forced into announcing he would carry on during a TV interview that was conducted mid-celebration and felt like a set-up. But Getafe were back in the top flight and Bordal\u00e1s was there at last. \u201cBordal\u00e1s, a first division manager,\u201d one headline ran, a little pointedly. At the end of the season, Getafe released central defender Cata D\u00edaz, leaving his wife Celeste Marzella attacking Bordal\u00e1s as \u201cfalse, a traitor and a coward\u201d, accusing him of having spies in the dressing room. But those who are close to the manager are very close and extremely loyal. It is no coincidence that many of the same players end up working with him again. He is, players insist, an expert in group management. He brings players together \u2013 often against some perceived common enemy, from the outside or, sometimes, from within \u2013 and is skilled at getting them to understand what he wants. Motivation is key and even those that see oddness see value; they recognise he gets a lot from his squad and there\u2019s fondness too. Bordal\u00e1s can be angry, wound up, hot-headed, demanding, but the intensity is relieved by the fact that he can be genuinely funny too. \u201cHe might transmit nastiness sometimes but even years later people remember the things he said, the amusing phrases,\u201d says one close observer. Bordal\u00e1s has a strong team around him \u2013 fitness coach Javier Vidal is very highly rated \u2013 and he is, in the words of one player, \u201cvery, very intense\u201d. Cala says: \u201cHe controls every aspect: diet, rest, training, tactics. And his training sessions are incredibly pesado, heavy-going. The intensity is unbelievable.\u201d Another says: \u201cHe would go absolutely crazy if you didn\u2019t do what he wanted.\u201d He seeks to take advantage of every detail he can, seeing significance in the \u201cother football\u201d \u2013 knowing when to break a move down, how to effectively end a game. What he wants always includes not letting the other team play. The message is relentless and it is clear, simple: compete. Getafe have competed so far, that\u2019s for sure. They have lost three times at home this season: 2-1 against Barcelona, 2-1 against Madrid, 1-0 against Sevilla. In all three, they probably deserved more, although they could stand accused \u2013 and striker Jorge Molina admitted as much \u2013 of perhaps dropping too deep. Their style is simple: tight, aggressive, direct. Not always pretty, but often pretty effective. It can be tempting to see Uruguayan full-back Dami\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez as the embodiment of that style, at times almost cartoonish in his aggressiveness and risky too; Vicente Guaita has had a superb season in goal; Djen\u00e9 Dakonam has impressed; and the speed and skill of \u00c1ngel has been striking. But this is a collective and then there are a couple of other players who particularly stand out. Markel Bergara has given them consistency and a character that is contagious. In 14 games he has also scored more than he did in 146 for Real Sociedad. Then up front they have Molina, one half of Bordal\u00e1s\u2019s favoured little-and-large approach, top scorer last season with 20 goals and central to everything they do this \u2013 the 35-year-old who helps define their style. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one in the team who is irreplaceable,\u201d Cala insists. \u201c\u00c1ngel can be missing, Markel can be missing, Djene, me \u2026 but Jorge can\u2019t. We don\u2019t have anyone else who can do what he does. 60%, 70%, of our game is long ball and the only one who brings it down is Jorge. He battles with the centre-backs, controls it, moves. People say \u2018yeah, but so-and-so \u2026\u2019 No, no, no: Jorge. If you\u2019re defending and you can go long to him, that means the world. He gives us life.\u201d There is life in Getafe, where as far as the manager is concerned every defeat is a \u201cdeath\u201d, week after week after week. Last Monday, Getafe were defeated 1-0 at Espanyol. \u201cAfter that, the week he gave us \u2026 pffff,\u201d Cala says. \u201cHorrific.\u201d Six days later, they became the first team this season to beat Valencia, denying them the chance to close to within two points of Barcelona at the top. It was the kind of game that defines them, for better and worse. Despite being a man down from the 25th minute after Mauro Arambarri got his second yellow, despite suffering at times, Bergara\u2019s deflected shot gave them a lead after 67 minutes. Dani Parejo hit the post with a free-kick, Guaita was sharp and the goal came as Valencia were starting to get behind them and create chances; after that, the game changed. It would be tempting to say it died, which was what Getafe wanted. As the clock ticked away, there were bodies everywhere. Players in blue dropped like flies, if not flies who actually had much wrong with them. Simone Zaza grinned at a ballboy, gesturing to him; the cheeky scamp grinned back. They both knew what he was up to and he wasn\u2019t about to go any faster. There was still time for more opportunities, though: the board went up with five minutes on it \u2013 it could have said twice that \u2013 and in the very last minute Zaza headed over. At the whistle, the Coliseum erupted, Getafe\u2019s players embracing and punching the air. They really are back. Before the game, Bordal\u00e1s had gone round telling his players of the importance to make it \u201cuncomfortable\u201d for Valencia and they did that. Afterwards, just as Ivan Rakitic had done a few weeks before, Parejo complained about the state of the pitch, which was dry and cut up. \u201cIt looked like they haven\u2019t tended to it all week,\u201d he said. Parejo insisted it was \u201cno excuse\u201d, but it was part of the explanation \u2013 even though, while it probably helped Getafe, it has been a problem that some of their players feel they have endured too \u2013 just as the way the home side tried to prevent much happening was part of the explanation. Up until the sending off, they had three cards and lots of fouls: \u201cThat\u2019s football but it made it difficult for us,\u201d Valencia\u2019s assistant manager Rub\u00e9n Ur\u00eda admitted. \u201cToday this looked like the team I want,\u201d Bordal\u00e1s said, throat hoarse and voice barely audible. \u201cIf we don\u2019t compete, we fall a long way. Today they gave everything. What honour! What humility! That\u2019s what I take with me \u2013 that and the kilometres they ran.\u201d They had done what no one else could \u2013 not Barcelona, not Atl\u00e9tico, not Sevilla either \u2013 and beaten Valencia, taking Getafe nine points and 10 places clear of the relegation zone. \u201cFans are \u2018brave\u2019; maybe they\u2019ll start talking about Europe but our only objective at the start, now, and at the end is survival,\u201d Cala said. \u201cAnd tomorrow Valencia will have gone. Tomorrow he\u2019ll be talking about Saturday again, living the game, like: \u2018Bloody hell, we\u2019re playing for our lives here\u2019.\u201d Talking points \u2022 \u201cAnother train departs,\u201d ran the front cover of AS. On Saturday afternoon, Barcelona departed the Camp Nou, heads down, Sergio Busquets lamenting the two points lost against Celta while Iago Aspas, who was superb, insisted: \u201cIt\u2019s never a good day to come here but this time we deserved a draw \u2026 in fact, a point might even be too little given that we had another chance to make it 3-2.\u201d By Saturday night, though, the point looked pretty good. \u201cA point the size of a Cathedral,\u201d Sport called it. By Sunday night, it looked even better. The reason was simple: Barcelona drew with Celta, but Madrid couldn\u2019t take advantage. Twice they hit the post and there were opportunities to have won it but they drew 0-0 at San Mam\u00e9s. After 35 consecutive away games scoring, that\u2019s two in a row that have finished without a goal. Zidane said he was happy, which is what he always says, and Madrid might have won it but yet again this wasn\u2019t just about missed opportunities. As the game went on, so they ran out of ideas, delivering cross after cross that mostly went nowhere in particular. In the pouring rain, the imprecision was alarming \u2013 and not just from Athletic. So, Barcelona\u2019s lead over Madrid was retained \u2013 and, ultimately, their lead over Valencia was expanded. That said, they lost Samuel Umtiti to a torn hamstring. La Liga\u2019s best defender so far this season, he\u2019ll be out for two months. \u201cAnother league starts here,\u201d said AS, and they might be right. Madrid are fourth now, and have next week\u2019s opponents Sevilla just behind them after they won on Saturday. Of the top four, only Atl\u00e9tico got all three points, their first big night at A Stadium Called Wanda ending with an 88th-minute winner to see off Real Sociedad 2-1. For all the doubts, they\u2019re unbeaten this season \u2013 a run that goes back 18 games, a club record. \u2022 Applause for Asier Garitano. Not only did his Legan\u00e9s side beat Villarreal, to end a four-match, fearful-fixture packed losing run, he also got into a touchline discussion with Villarreal captain Mario in which he told his opponent not to give the ball back from a throw-in and then told off his fans for whistling him. \u201cWe don\u2019t kick the ball out and we don\u2019t ask anyone else to do so either,\u201d he said. \u2022 \u201cAt last,\u201d said Xavi Aguado. \u201cIt was a matter of time,\u201d replied Pablo Alfaro. They both received 18 red cards in La Liga. That was a record once, but not any more. On Sunday night Sergio Ramos got his 24th red card, his 19th in the league. \u2022 And Las Palmas won! (Pako Ayesteran was sacked in midweek, in case you\u2019re wondering.) They sliced through Betis, whose manager Quique Seti\u00e9n is on the ropes. \u201cThe players are scared,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ball is burning their feet.\u201d Results: M\u00e1laga 0\u20130 Levante, Barcelona 2\u20132 Celta, Atl\u00e9tico 2\u20131 Real Sociedad, Sevilla 2\u20130 Deportivo, Athletic Bilbao 0\u20130 Real Madrid, Legan\u00e9s 3\u20131 Villarreal, Getafe 1\u20130 Valencia, Eibar 3\u20131 Espanyol, Las Palmas 1\u20130 Betis. Monday: Girona v Alav\u00e9s."
"26||Bitcoin: UK and EU plan crackdown amid crime and tax evasion fearsThe UK and other EU governments are planning a crackdown on bitcoin amid growing concerns that the digital currency is being used for money laundering and tax evasion. The Treasury plans to regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to bring them in line with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financial legislation. Traders will be forced to disclose their identities, ending the anonymity that has made the currency attractive for drug dealing and other illegal activities. Under the EU-wide plan, online platforms where bitcoins are traded will be required to carry out due diligence on customers and report suspicious transactions. The UK government is negotiating amendments to the anti-money-laundering directive to ensure firms\u2019 activities are overseen by national authorities. The Treasury said: \u201cWe are working to address concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies by negotiating to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and some wallet providers within anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation.\u201d The rules are expected to come into effect in the next few months. The Treasury said digital currencies could be used to enable and facilitate cybercrime. It added: \u201cThere is little current evidence of them being used to launder money, though this risk is expected to grow.\u201d The bosses of Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have criticised bitcoin as a vehicle to commit fraud and other crimes. But Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, last week said the digital currency was too small to pose a systemic threat to the global economy. He also cautioned that bitcoin investors needed \u201cto do their homework\u201d. Bitcoin was trading at $11,566 on Monday. It hit a fresh record high of $11,800 on Sunday but fell to $10,554 on news of the regulatory crackdown. The Labour MP John Mann, a member of the House of Commons Treasury select committee, suggested MPs would look into the regulation of virtual currencies. He told the Daily Telegraph: \u201cThese new forms of exchange are expanding rapidly and we\u2019ve got to make sure we don\u2019t get left behind \u2013 that\u2019s particularly important in terms of money laundering, terrorism or pure theft. \u201cIt would be timely to have a proper look at what this means. It may be that we want speed up our use of these kinds of thing in this country, but that makes it all the more important that we don\u2019t have a regulatory lag.\u201d Stephen Barclay, the economic secretary to the Treasury, set out the government\u2019s plans in a written parliamentary answer in October. \u201cThe UK government is currently negotiating amendments to the anti-money-laundering directive that will bring virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers into anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation, which will result in these firms\u2019 activities being overseen by national competent authorities for these areas. \u201cThe government supports the intention behind these amendments. We expect these negotiations to conclude at EU level in late 2017 or early 2018.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."

"7||Why will Tulip Siddiq not speak out on Bangladesh\u2019s \u2018disappeared\u2019 innocents?We don\u2019t often find the leader of another country popping in to listen to the maiden speech of a British member of parliament. Yet that was the privilege afforded to Tulip Siddiq, after she was elected to represent the people of Hampstead and Kilburn in 2015. Looking proudly on from the gallery was Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the prime minister of Bangladesh since 2009, under whose watch hundreds of political opponents have been \u201cdisappeared\u201d \u2013 kidnapped by state security forces and ending up either dead or incarcerated with no recourse to justice. Last year the family of one such victim approached me to press their case. Mir Ahmad bin Quasem, or Arman as he is known to friends and family, is a British-trained Bangladeshi lawyer who was abducted in August 2016 by state security forces. They knocked on his door and, in front of his wife and young children, dragged him away. This abduction followed the exact modus operandi of other abductions by the security forces in Bangladesh. Since this incident there has been no confirmation of his whereabouts, but we believe that he is still alive. Mir Ahmad was on the defence team for his father, Quasem Ali, who was prosecuted by Bangladesh\u2019s self-styled \u201cinternational crimes tribunal\u201d, set up by the ruling party in Bangladesh to try crimes committed during the country\u2019s war of liberation against Pakistan. The tribunal has been widely criticised internationally, including by groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as the United Nations high commissioner for human rights and eminent British lawyers. Along these lines, Mir Ahmad decided to join his father\u2019s defence team but was abducted a month before his father\u2019s execution, while the appeal procedure was still under way. Mir Ahmad has not been charged with any offence and his abduction and continued detention by the Bangladeshi government is contrary to the Bangladeshi constitution and the country\u2019s obligations under international law. Forced disappearances are common in Bangladesh under the current government: more than 320 people have been disappeared since 2009. Mir Ahmad is one of three sons of former politicians who were abducted at around the same time, one of whom has been released. In a secret recording obtained by Swedish radio, it is claimed by a high-ranking government security officer that the fate of those seized is decided by those \u201chigh up\u201d. Astonishingly, as reported in these pages, Sheikh Hasina recently claimed that such forced disappearances also occur in Britain and the US, saying \u201c275,000 British citizens disappeared\u201d in the UK each year. For over a year I have been trying to establish Mir Ahmad\u2019s whereabouts and campaigning to have him released. When I visited the capital to speak to diplomatic representatives, who are all very concerned about this case, I was told that the key to getting Arman released was to ask the Bangladeshi prime minister\u2019s niece, Tulip Siddiq MP, to speak out and use her influence. I have written to her office several times but, as yet, with no success. Last week Channel 4 News raised the issue and put the matter to Siddiq. The interaction now has become a matter of public record. Siddiq complained that Mir Ahmad was not her constituent, that she had no sway over Bangladeshi politics and that in any case she was a British MP focusing on Britain. And yet earlier this week the Bangladeshi cabinet adopted a resolution \u201cgreeting\u201d the Hampstead and Kilburn MP for winning an award in Westminster. Siddiq accompanied the Bangladeshi prime minister during bilateral talks between Russia and Bangladesh in January 2013. Her paternal uncle is Tarique Ahmed Siddique, security adviser to the prime minister. Her brother Radwan Siddiq was nominated for the ruling party\u2019s council [see footnote]. It is said in diplomatic circles that he is being groomed to be a future leader of Bangladesh. It is clear that Tulip Siddiq has a close relationship with various government figures in Bangladesh, including the prime minister. Even if we are to take Siddiq at her word that she has no sway over Bangladeshi politics, what is preventing her from at least speaking out? My client may not be Siddiq\u2019s constituent, but nor is he the constituent of Shabana Mahmood MP, who raised an official parliamentary question on the matter earlier this year. Before and since the Channel 4 News report was aired, the family of Mir Ahmad bin Quasem have been visited by state security forces who have reportedly warned them that \u201cif there is any such news, come next time we will not be good like this time and you will not get to see our face like today\u201d. Since it has come to this, I earnestly hope that Siddiq can speak out to try to help ensure that Mir Ahmad\u2019s mother, sister, wife and two young daughters are not intimidated by the Bangladeshi security services or face enforced disappearance themselves. This is an urgent matter and I ask Tulip Siddiq, as I have done many times before, to speak to me so it can be resolved. \u2022 Michael Polak is a barrister specialising in criminal, public and human rights law. \u2022 Note added 5 January 2018: After publication, Tulip Siddiq\u2019s brother Radwan Siddiq advised the Guardian that he had declined the nomination to the ruling party\u2019s council."
"8||MEPs say UK has conceded on Ireland border in Brexit talksThe British government appears to have bowed to the Republic of Ireland\u2019s demand that Northern Ireland will stay aligned with key EU laws and regulations after Brexit so as to ensure that a hard border does not return to the island. According to sources, MEPs were told by the chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, that Theresa May had conceded after days of intense talks that the province would be treated as a special case. A draft of the text of a 15-page joint statement between the European commission and the British government is said to include a commitment in paragraph 48 that \u201cin the absence of agreed solutions the UK will ensure that there continues to be continued regulatory alignment\u201d with the internal market and customs union. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, told RTE News that Ireland had been reassured that there would be no re-emergence of a hard border. \u201cCertainly the indications we have is that we are in a much better place than we have been in Brexit negotiations to date,\u201d Coveney said. \u201cWe have now a language that gives us the safeguards we need.\u201d It is understood Ireland sees the phrase \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d as providing the highest degree of comfort to both sides, allowing talks to move to the next phase while at the same time giving room for manoeuvre for negotiations in the second phase. The UK still hopes that an ambitious and unprecedented trade deal will be struck with the EU in the future that makes the agreement struck on Monday academic. However, the formulation that appears to have been struck by London and Dublin would in effect keep Northern Ireland in keys aspects of the single market and customs union in event of a less generous trade accord being settled in the future. Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionists, reiterated her party\u2019s stance that the province must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the the UK. \u201cWe will not accept any form of regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom,\u201d Foster said in a strongly worded statement. \u201cThe economic and constitutional integrity of the UK must not be compromised in any way.\u201d One senior DUP source described the text of the joint statement as an \u201cIrish government-inspired\u201d leak, though no formal statement from the party has been issued. Sammy Wilson, the MP for East Antrim, stressed that he and the other nine DUP MPs in Westminster \u201chad the leverage\u201d to block an unacceptable deal given Theresa May\u2019s dependence on the party for a working majority in the Commons. In a sign of the risk posed to the government by the Irish border issue, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the mayor of London were quick to call for special treatment too: Emerging from a meeting with Barnier and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Monday morning, the leader of the Greens in the European parliament, Philippe Lamberts, said that he had seen the joint text and Britain had accepted the \u201creality\u201d of their situation. \u201cThe pie is almost ready. It was a surprise to me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is a matter of [Britain] facing reality. I think agreement is there.\u201d The president of the European council, Donald Tusk, tweeted: \u201cTell me why I like Mondays! Encouraged after my phone call with Taoiseach on progress on #Brexit issue of Ireland. Getting closer to sufficient progress at December #EUCO.\u201d Tusk had earlier in the day cancelled a planned trip to the Middle East in order to concentrate on the Brexit talks and make preparations on the EU\u2019s guidelines for a future trading relationship with the UK. He is seeing May later on Monday. A final sign off in the joint text will be made by May and Juncker at a lunch in Brussels on Monday. Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, called a special meeting of all party leaders to update them on Brexit at lunchtime. A statement planned for 2.30pm was postponed. At the regular morning No 10 lobby briefing May\u2019s official spokesman had insisted there would be no difference in the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. \u201cThe PM has been clear that the UK is leaving the EU as a whole, and the territorial and economic integrity of the UK will be protected,\u201d he said, refusing to elaborate further on what that meant. Beyond the issue of the Irish border, Lambert said there was \u201cstill some fine tuning to be done\u201d on citizens\u2019 rights, but not enough to hold up talks on trade. EU sources said the UK has conceded on allowing EU nationals living in the UK to continue to export social security benefits such as the winter fuel allowance to their home countries. It is holding out on charging applicants for settled status and there are still some technical discussions ongoing about the role of the European court of justice in protecting the rights of EU nationals, it is understood.

"2||Steve Smith misses chance to land knockout blow with England staggeringIf you find a bruise, punch it. In the political arena, teachings do not come much clearer. On the evening of day three, Steve Smith had a chance to land a Jean-Claude Van Damme spin-kick into Joe Root\u2019s ribs. By not enforcing the follow-on, the Australians allowed the visitors to sleep a lot less battered than they should have. It may not be that much of a sample size, but the indisputable learning from day-night Tests is that it is much harder to bat under lights when the ball is hard and new. When Australia toppled England barely a quarter of an hour into the final session on Monday, their bowlers had earned the opportunity to humiliate England and go again. There was a chance to dismiss Root\u2019s top order \u2013 the captain included \u2013 twice in a day. Instead, Jimmy Anderson found the burst of energy he was looking for, then Chris Woakes too. The fruit of their labour is that Smith, David Warner, Usman Khawaja and Cameron Bancroft have all had their final bat in the match. \u201cIt was purely up to Smithy,\u201d Mitchell Starc said of the decision after play, carefully answering a barrage of questions to avoid throwing his captain under the bus. Did the fast bowlers get consulted? \u201cWe didn\u2019t tonight.\u201d But asked on ABC radio if he would have liked the chance, he wasn\u2019t shy: \u201cNight-time is the best to bowl.\u201d In modern times, fast-bowling workloads are the usual reason not to go again. In this case, the attack-leading left-armer had sent down only 20 overs, while Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins had 16 apiece. When the call was made, the temperature outside was 15C and 26 overs were scheduled before the close. If ever the factors had lined up for a follow-on tilt, this was it. \u201cWe know the night session is the toughest time to bat,\u201d Starc said, to reinforce the self-evident point. \u201cAs we saw tonight, for example.\u201d We sure did. Of course, the conservative decision did not undo Australia\u2019s fine work with the ball. With another Nathan Lyon bag of four, The Smiths might ask to stop me if you think you\u2019ve heard this one before. His first wicket \u2013 Australia\u2019s third of the morning \u2013 made it 50 in Tests against the old enemy. Another trundle, another record. In 2017, he is now equal top of the world charts with 55 victims at 22 apiece. Lyon\u2019s fourth wicket, to finish off England after the dinner break, had him passing the great inter-war leg-spinner Clarrie Grimmett for wickets taken at the Adelaide Oval, with only four Australian greats left ahead of him. It is no surprise that his success on Monday came against left-handers: he has seen off 28 of those this year at an absurd average of 12.5. Alastair Cook was the first, coaxed into probing when he did not need to. He has now fallen to Lyon six times in 15 duels. Moeen Ali\u2019s edge was beaten on three occasions upon arrival but he fell due to individual brilliance of another kind, when Lyon threw himself with his non-preferred left hand to pull off a brilliant diving return catch. That trick was replicated by Starc 20 minutes later in a reflex take off Jonny Bairstow. There might be a bit of luck and instinct involved in dismissals like these, but the athleticism in the field shown by Australia\u2019s bowlers highlights that they bring more to the side than flinging or ripping at the bowling crease. Hazlewood\u2019s efforts to haul down a boundary, diving and flicking with his left hand to keep the ball in play, was further evidence. As for Cummins, CricViz calculated during England\u2019s horrid top-order display that he has middled more balls this series than any of the touring batsmen. Little wonder that Starc has been tweeting that the No9 can graduate into his position at eight any time he feels like it. There is no letting off with this quartet when hunting wickets or otherwise. It makes Smith\u2019s decision all the more puzzling. Having removed England for 227 during the day, imagine the carnage Australia\u2019s attack might have caused at night. The chance of it making a material difference in this game is slim but England\u2019s quicks are at least in the scrap. They might now land a few punches themselves."
"16||Ian Rankin and Ali Smith lead warning of 'devastating' Scottish arts cutsSome of the biggest names in Scottish literature, from Ian Rankin to Ali Smith, have warned the Scottish government that cuts to literature funding would leave future generations to look back on the early 21st century \u201cand lament the absence of the next Muriel Spark, the next Robert Louis Stevenson, the next Edwin Morgan\u201d. More than 100 Scottish writers, including Kate Atkinson, Alexander McCall Smith and Irvine Welsh, have put their names to an open letter in which they raise concerns that next week\u2019s Scottish budget could see \u201cdevastating cuts\u201d to culture funding. Calling on the Scottish government to increase funding for arts and literature, they warn that without this support, the country\u2019s \u201cworld-renowned literary heritage\u201d will be damaged. The authors point to \u201cScotland\u2019s longstanding commitment to making culture and the arts accessible for all\u201d, both by building readership and supporting the industry through grants for writers, festivals and publishers, and through training and mentoring schemes. \u201cHarry Potter, The No 1 Ladies\u2019 Detective Agency, The Gruffalo \u2013 these are just some of the many international success stories that have been helped by Scotland\u2019s literary support system,\u201d say the group of 111 writers, who range across the spectrum of Scottish writing, from poets such as Jackie Kay, Kathleen Jamie and Liz Lochhead, to novelists including Michel Faber, AL Kennedy, Chris Brookmyre and Jenny Colgan. \u201cOf course there are difficult budget decisions to make in times of austerity, but the cost of supporting literature only amounts to a tiny fraction of the overall money the government will spend. When it comes to the arts and literature, for a modest investment from the government our work generates enormous financial and cultural dividends.\u201d Val McDermid, the bestselling Scottish crime novelist, said that she was moved to sign the letter because while \u201cthe arts are an easy target for budget cuts \u2026 it\u2019s a short-sighted approach\u201d. \u201cLeaving to one side the impact on the culture of the country, politicians should remember how much income is generated by our work, both directly and in the indirect form of tourism. We more than pay our way. Cutting new work off at the knees is like eating the seedcorn,\u201d McDermid said. The letter points to the irony of a situation in which funding to new writers is cut back, while first minister Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s reading challenge for children is trumpeted. \u201cWill future generations look back on the early 21st century and lament the absence of the next Muriel Spark, the next Robert Louis Stevenson, the next Edwin Morgan? We can\u2019t be certain,\u201d write the authors. \u201cBut without support from the government, Scotland will surely damage one of its prize assets: its world-renowned literary heritage.\u201d The Scottish draft budget is due to be published on 14 December. Last month, Creative Scotland\u2019s chair, Ben Thomson, wrote to culture secretary Karen Bradley warning that the decline in National Lottery money coming to the funding organisation would \u201chave a significant negative impact on our ability to fund arts organisations\u201d. Last week, board member Ruth Wishart warned of the \u201ccultural carnage\u201d that government cuts would cause: \u201cA whole swathe of our artistic community unable to be funded, many of whom would inevitably go to the wall as a result,\u201d she wrote in the Herald."

In some cases, personal statements are read numerous times \u2013 particularly at results when a student misses their required grades. \u201cThe admissions director needs to read them swiftly. Straightforward and confident language works best,\u201d says Alix Delany, head of admissions at UEA. Do get a proofreader. Atkinson advises making friends with your English teacher and having them check it for you. \u201cShow it to as many people as possible \u2013 especially if you know anyone with a background in human resources.\u201d Do focus on what the university says it wants. Universities usually publish admissions statements which outline what they\u2019re looking for in their candidates. Each uni will be looking for something a little bit different: some will focus entirely on your academic activities, others will also pay attention to your hobbies. Do show that you\u2019ll be active at university. Any personal examples of work experience, weekend jobs or school activities can be of use. Almost any hobby can be relevant in some way. Be sure to relate them to your studies. Playing an instrument, for example, shows application, stamina and the ability to study and practice, as well as teamwork if you play with other people. Don\u2019t try too hard to be funny \u2013 it doesn\u2019t always come across well in writing. \u201cYou\u2019re not a professional writer and the person who reads it won\u2019t be looking for that. All they\u2019re looking at is whether you fit their criteria,\u201d says Atkinson. Don\u2019t bother with quotes. Julie Tucker, from the applicant services team at Falmouth University, says the statements that get an academics\u2019 attention are less formulaic. \u201cAvoid using well-known quotes from famous people, and avoid stating the obvious,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you are applying to join a fashion design course, steer clear of Coco Chanel quotes. If you\u2019re applying to study film, don\u2019t open by saying you\u2019ve watched films from a young age.\u201d Do use your own voice. \u201cPersonal statements are largely scored in an objective way. You need correct English, without looking like you\u2019ve swallowed a thesaurus,\u201d says Atkinson. \u201cI would avoid grandiose or highly idealistic statements such as \u2018from the moment I was born I was destined to cure people\u2019. That\u2019s the kind of thing people write. Keep it prosaic and to the point.\u201d Do be honest. For courses that interview their applicants, academic teams often use the personal statement to guide their questioning. \u201cWith that in mind, applicants shouldn\u2019t use anything they\u2019re not comfortable talking about in detail,\u201d says Tucker. Dr Sam Lucy, director of admissions at Cambridge, agrees. They often refer to personal statements at interview. \u201cWe\u2019re checking that their enthusiasm is genuine. In particular, we should get an idea of where within your subject this enthusiasm lies.\u201d"
"16||\u00c9mile Zola, the photographer: personal collection goes under the hammer\u00c9mile Zola is best known as the 19th century French author of celebrated works including Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin, Nana and Germinal. Now, the leader of the Naturalist literary movement is being recognised as a talented and experimental photographer with the auction of a rarely seen personal collection of pictures. In the eight years before his death in 1902, Zola became obsessed with photography, taking thousands of pictures with his 10 cameras and developing them in the basements of his three homes. The collection, expected to fetch up to \u20ac60,000 (\u00a353,000) when it goes under the hammer on Monday evening, belonged to the writer\u2019s grandson, Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9mile-Zola, who died in 1989, who inherited it from Zola\u2019s son, Jacques. The auction includes albums, prints, glass plates and photographic equipment as well as white linen laboratory coats embroidered with Zola\u2019s initials. Much of it was only seen for the first time in 1979, when Emile-Zola published a book, Zola, photographe. Zola was 54 when he discovered photography; he not only took pictures but also experimented with film development and made his own contact sheets. The collection includes images of his wife, Alexandrine, and the children he had with his mistress, Jeanne, his favourite model, as well as scenes of Paris in the 1890s and pictures taken during his 11 months in exile in London. Zola was forced to flee France after being caught up in the Dreyfus affair. In an open letter to the French president, F\u00e9lix Faure, headlined \u201cJ\u2019Accuse\u2026!\u201d, Zola accused army top brass of fixing the trial of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, who was found guilty of spying. Zola also developed a form of selfie, taking auto-portraits using a makeshift trigger. Antoine Romand, a photography expert at Artcurial, which is organising the auction, told France Culture the author had a \u201cspecial eye\u201d and his pictures were \u201cwell framed and well exposed\u201d. \u201cHe made his own prints and developed his own films, so he mastered the chemical process of photography. He messed up from time to time, but that\u2019s how he learned.\u201d Romand said an auto-portrait of Zola from about 1900 in profile printed in blue was \u201crare for the period\u201d. \u201cThe convention was to pose face on or with three-quarters of the face to the lens. Here, the fact that he posed in profile gives a greater dramatic tension. This photo shows us how Zola was very curious. He wanted to make new discoveries and we have a sense of a permanent aesthetic quest,\u201d Romand said."
"15||Detectorists strike gold as British Museum reveals record haulA glorious jewel made from hundreds of tiny pieces of garnet set in gold to form geometric and animal shapes lay for 1,400 years on the breast of an unknown woman until her Norfolk grave was rediscovered by a first-year university student. The item was among a record number of treasure finds reported by the British Museum in the year 2016. The pendant and other jewels and coins buried with the woman were among the spectacular discoveries mainly made by metal detectorists \u2013 including a hoard of 158 bronze age axes and ingots, the largest of its kind to be found in Yorkshire; and more than 2,000 silver Roman coins in Piddletrenthide, Dorset, which the finder and a local archaeologist managed to lift together with the clay pot holding them and the entire block of soil in which it was buried, so it could be studied at the British Museum. The grave of the Norfolk woman, who probably had aristocratic or royal connections, was found by Tom Lucking, then a landscape history student at the University of East Anglia. He has since graduated with a first and found work as an archaeologist. His student loan debt repayments will be made considerably easier by the \u00a3145,000 valuation recently agreed at the British Museum for his treasure, which will be shared with the landowner. Lucking was detecting on a ploughed field at Winfarthing, a site with no record of any Anglo-Saxon settlement. He first found a bronze bowl, which he then realised lay at the feet of a skeleton. He stopped digging and called in the county archaeology unit. The excavation revealed decayed bones barely identifiable as a young adult woman. She had been buried with her treasures, which included the gold and garnet pendant, two identical Merovingian gold coins made into pendants, two gold beads and a delicate filigree ornamented cross, suggesting the woman may have been one of the earliest Anglo-Saxon converts to Christianity. The coins, which showed no sign of wear, dated the burial to between AD650 and AD675. They were identical to one found in the grave of a woman near Ipswich, suggesting intriguing connections with the Frankish kingdom. Tim Pestell, senior curator of archaeology at Norfolk Museums service, which is to begin fundraising to acquire the items, said: \u201cThis is one of those rare finds which really does rewrite history: a burial of the highest stature, in a part of Norfolk where we would not have expected to find it, with objects imported from the continent and which connect her to finds at other sites. \u201cThe garnet work is of the highest quality \u2013 not quite as good as Sutton Hoo, which stands alone, but certainly comparable to the Staffordshire hoard.\u201d Work continues at the site, which has been identified as a cemetery, possibly with a nearby settlement, evidence of which has been almost obliterated by centuries of farming. The scattered remains of her family may still lie in the soil. There was so much metal in two hoards of axes and bronze ingots found at Driffield in east Yorkshire that they are thought to have been a metal worker\u2019s collection that was ready to be melted and recycled. They were found four metres apart by Dave Haldenby, a retired social worker, who was previously more interested in medieval history and had been hoping to find Viking lead weights. He uncovered the smaller hoard of 27 axes and ingots and, after researching the late bronze age of about 3,000 years ago, returned to survey the surrounding area for scraps of metal. He found a further 158 axes and ingots, which Hull Museum plans to acquire. There were 1,120 treasure finds in 2016, the highest number since the revised Treasure Act came into law 20 years ago. While \u201ctreasure\u201d must by law be reported, the act simplified the definition. Although local coroners still hold inquests to declare the discoveries as treasure, they no longer have to determine the motives and circumstances in which the objects were hidden or lost. Over the past 20 years, 14,000 treasure finds have been reported under the act, of which 40% are in UK museums. They include the spectacular Staffordshire hoard, with its exquisitely worked gold, and the Frome hoard of more than 52,000 Roman coins stuffed into a giant clay jar, the largest collection found in one container. In addition, there were 81,914 smaller archaeological finds \u2013 including a 17th-century dog collar whose inscription showed that the large hunting dog it was made for was owned by Samuel Birch, a former civil war major who was once thrown out of church for nonconformist preaching. The collar was among the objects reported through a network of local finds officers across the country under the voluntary portable antiquities scheme. The initiative, operated in tandem with the treasure scheme through the British Museum, has recorded more than 1.3m objects, including buttons, stone axes, belt buckles, bits of horse harness, pilgrims\u2019 badges and children\u2019s toys. Many of the items have almost no commercial value but contain great historic importance, helping to identify hundreds of sites and settlements. The database has inspired more than 600 research projects, including 126 doctorates. Most detectorists are signed up to a code of practice that requires them to stop digging and call in the experts over significant discoveries. They must also report all finds. The director of the British Museum, Hartwig Fischer, said the scheme was rare in Europe. \u201cYou let people follow their passion with a couple of rules you should abide by. Everyone does best.\u201d"
"8||I'm a Celebrity \u2026 I did the right thing, says evicted Kezia DugdaleKezia Dugdale, the former Scottish Labour leader, has insisted she did the right thing appearing on I\u2019m a Celebrity after becoming the second contestant to be evicted from the programme. Speaking from Australia after being voted out by viewers, Dugdale acknowledged that her appearance on the TV reality show was a \u201cbig gamble\u201d and she would face heavy criticism when she returned to Scotland \u201cI know I\u2019m going back to a good deal of criticism and I will take that face on. I\u2019ve got to have a lot of conversations with people but I\u2019m going back with my head held high,\u201d she told the ITV morning show Lorraine. \u201cI came out here to do what I wanted to do, I believe I\u2019ve succeeded in that and I love my job. It\u2019s a great privilege to be a Labour politician and I fully intend on continuing to do it for a very long time.\u201d Dugdale faces an internal inquiry from Scottish Labour when she returns home to Edinburgh because she agreed to take part in the show without formal approval from party officials to be absent from the Scottish parliament. To her horror, news she was to be a contestant leaked out the night before the party unveiled her successor as Scottish leader, Richard Leonard, on 18 November after a tense and ill-tempered campaign sparked by Dugdale\u2019s unexpected resignation in August. She had delayed her arrival in Australia to avoid it clashing with the leadership contest, and promised to donate her MSP\u2019s salary for the duration of her absence and part of her winnings, said to be a high five-figure sum, to charity. Leonard and other colleagues have been highly critical of her decision but she told the show\u2019s hosts, Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, immediately after her eviction on Sunday night UK time that she wanted to show viewers that not all politicians were \u201cold, white, male, pale and stale\u201d. She told ITV on Monday morning: \u201cThe way I look at it is this is the most-watched family TV programme in the history of TV, so to speak, and it\u2019s watched largely by young people aged 18 to 24. \u201cThat is the very group of people who are least engaged with politics so a big part of why I wanted to do this was to go out there and show people that politics matters, that there is a big difference between the two major parties, that your vote does count, to encourage young people to vote, because it\u2019s only if young people vote that they will get the type of change that they want to see in their country.\u201d Dugdale did not prosper on the show, however, on which she drank a milkshake of ostrich and pig anuses and crawled through fish guts in a tank labelled Sickola Sturgeon after Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. Its producers were reportedly underwhelmed by her performance, and said she had failed to bond with her co-stars, including Stanley Johnson, father of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. Dugdale often failed to win enough stars towards meals and treats in her tasks. Some predicted she would be the first to be evicted on Friday, but that accolade went to comedian Shappi Khorsandi. Dugdale\u2019s supporters set up a dedicated @TeamKez Twitter feed to promote her appearance. It failed to take off, attracting just 1,213 followers, despite Sturgeon backing her. Not put off by her milkshake, Dugdale declared she most wanted a bacon roll now she was back in society."
"2||Craig Overton shows guts and gumption while batsmen fail to meet expectationsGreat Expectations, so the rather lame joke goes, is not nearly as good a read as you would hope. And it is fair to say they were in short supply when Craig Overton tramped out to the middle at 4.58pm on the third day in Adelaide with England staring into the void and Australia rampant. Here was England\u2019s debutant No9 joining Chris Woakes at the crease with the score 142 for seven and the deficit a neat 300. A swift and total subsidence by Joe Root\u2019s side and there was every chance Steve Smith may have invited them for another evening interrogation under the lights. Overton, fresh from three ducks in the warm-ups, was on for the dreaded \u201cAudi\u201d. While it was known that Overton is no mug with the bat for Somerset, in these parts it is as much about courage for the lower order. A working over in the nets on the night before his debut \u2013 a first clue that we would replace the heavily-bombed Jake Ball from the XI at Brisbane \u2013 was still but a mere taster of what was to come from Australia\u2019s quicks. But what followed showed that while the 23-year-old is clearly still raw, and his promotion has come about through a combination of injuries and suspension, the greatest unknown when making the step up to Test level \u2013 temperament \u2013 can be ticked off. In gutsing out an unbeaten 41 \u2013 one of bobs, weaves, guides and the odd club, while never taking backward step against Mitchell Starc and co \u2013 Overton not only added to his three wickets in the first innings but became the first England debutant to top score from No9 for 118 years. The stand of 66 from 99 balls between Woakes (33) and the 6ft 5in Overton, while resembling Han Solo and Chewbacca firing off their blasters on the retreat and forcing Smith to bat again, also brought with it of sense of what might have been from the batsmen earlier in the day however; the players for whom expectations are greater. After all, morning rain on the banks of the Torrens had made way for what was a fine afternoon on what has been the flattest of the three Adelaide day-night pitches to date. England, for all the gloom of their first two days, were expected to lay down a statement of intent that, if the Ashes are indeed changing hands, theirs would at least be cold and dead upon release. But just four balls into his morning\u2019s work and James Vince was toddling off, having for the second innings in a row nicked off to offer a creeping suspicion that his 83 first up at Brisbane was the exception. Josh Hazlewood has now located the ideal length for a No3 so flirty he will be next up on \u201cAshes Pashes\u201d challenge that urges couples in the crowd to kiss on the big screen. \u201cThis is the partnership, this is the Test, this is the Ashes,\u201d drawled Shane Warne on the Channel 9 commentary after Root punched gloves with Alastair Cook in the middle. Twenty minutes later, however he was gone, having skewed a drive to slip off Pat Cummins on nine when failing to get fully over the ball. Australia, it must be said, are enjoying their hold over England\u2019s captain. Thereafter it was a case of the specialist batsmen not meeting the brief of their head coach, Trevor Bayliss, and being ruthless enough to go big when set. Each had faced 50 balls, two \u2013 Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali \u2013 chipped return catches and Cook, though moving better than in Brisbane, was particularly deflating when he nibbled at Nathan Lyon\u2019s first ball after a drinks break. Only Dawid Malan, undone by a fine piece of bowling from Cummins that nicked the inside edge, can be said to be exempt, although Nathan Lyon, enjoying himself against the left-handers, is clearly in his head after some skittish dancing down the track to Australia\u2019s emboldened off-spinner. In the summer England\u2019s batsmen were accused of not respecting Test cricket after a loose and crushing defeat to South Africa at Trent Bridge and a response resulted thereafter. Here, though they are facing a well-oiled attack bowling fuller and quicker than their own, some personal hunger may need to be challenged again or the expectation is for a heavy series defeat."
"2||Tiger Woods looks stronger but history warns us against major predictionsPerhaps the smartest conclusion would be to avoid drawing any from the Hero World Challenge. A year ago, after equalling tournament winner Hideki Matsuyama for number of birdies over four rounds, Tiger Woods departed the tournament supposedly on the verge of a great renaissance. Woods spoke positively about the future, just as the wave of expectation surrounding him rose once more. By the start of February, Woods cut a stricken figure as he limped from the Dubai Desert Classic whilst unable to counteract back spasms beyond 18 holes. It would be easy to infer that Woods\u2019s lowest ebb, a driving under the influence charge that occurred in May, somehow triggered the upturn in personal and professional fortunes that has subsequently transpired. Even that requires context; Woods today leaps inside the top 670 in the world. He has been No1 for a record 683 cumulative weeks. Woods\u2019s Hero showing last year featured rounds of 73, 65, 70 and 76 for a total of four over par. He exited Albany on Sunday evening having carded 69, 68, 75 and 68 to aggregate eight under. Woods\u2019s long game, especially when produced with an effortless swing for a high and booming draw, this time appeared the equal to anyone in a stellar field with drives regularly pitching 295 yards from the tee. For all he has adopted a more open approach in recent times, there remains a Woods arrogance to the point of dismissal. He made cutting reference towards \u201cintelligent people\u201d who had suspected embarrassment may be forthcoming from Thursday onwards. \u201cI knew how I was playing at home, I knew how I was hitting shots, I knew what was going on,\u201d Woods insisted. Yet even Woods\u2019s caddie, Joe LaCava, admitted an element of surprise. \u201cI had a little advantage of seeing him twice in the last month, so I knew it was getting better and getting closer,\u201d said LaCava. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t think it was going to be quite as good as it is at the moment. We\u2019re much more optimistic going forward than we were last year.\u201d The 41-year-old\u2019s key statistics were decent if not spectacular; the finding of 46 of 72 greens in regulation, 34 from 52 fairways and a total of 100 putts. Woods was never the most accurate of drivers but, crucially, he could hit the ball further than anyone else and putt better than anyone else. It seems a huge leap of faith to suggest either will be the case before the unlikely event that Woods takes to seniors golf. The class of today may be in two minds as to whether they actually want an imperious Woods as part of the scene. Justin Thomas was reasonable enough to admit as much. \u201cI\u2019ve never played against that Tiger,\u201d said the USPGA champion. \u201cI don\u2019t want that Tiger just because judging by the statistics, not many of us would have that great of a chance. \u201cBut at the same time, obviously we want to be able to play against him and battle down the stretch with him. I mean, that\u2019s the person that I was making putts on the putting green when I was six, seven, eight years old pretending to beat. So it would be pretty fun to do it in person.\u201d The only time to paint an adequate picture of where Woods in his current condition sits in a competitive sense is after the playing of a full tournament schedule. Wide fairways and essentially a low-key Bahamas event \u2013 typically epic attention on Woods aside \u2013 doesn\u2019t compare to Augusta National. It doesn\u2019t compare to Carnoustie, the most ferocious of venues which will host the Open in July. How will a player who hasn\u2019t won a major since 2008 and any tournament at all since 2013 react when back in the position to close out? Nobody, including Woods, yet knows if apparently strong physical condition can withstand regular visits to PGA Tour events. When Woods admits the average age for a spinal fusion, as he underwent in his last surgery, is 58 there seems an obvious implication for his sporting longevity even before the stress as placed on backs by golf swings is factored in. Rickie Fowler, who prevailed on Sunday, revealed Woods carded 65 during a recent practice round in Florida. It was typical, and telling, that Fowler\u2019s champion\u2019s press conference was dominated by questions regarding another player. \u201cOne of the times we played 18 holes, I was going back to work out and he went and played another nine,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cI think he sharpened me up a little bit. I\u2019d gotten a little scared of how good he was playing at home, thought I needed to start playing a little bit better. \u201cTiger\u2019s still going to have that similar effect when you see his name on the board coming down the last nine holes and being in the mix. You know he\u2019s not scared. He\u2019s done it, he\u2019s been there before. I wouldn\u2019t say guys are scared. I think they\u2019re more excited about it and having him back and having the chance to play against Tiger, and we want to see him play well. It\u2019s only better for our game. \u201cI want all the guys I play against to be the best that they can be. I want to be able to beat guys that are playing at their best at that time. Whether Tiger can get back to where he was in early 2000s, we don\u2019t know. Could he get close? Possibly.\u201d This represented a seriously bold statement. What can be said is that Woods stepped back into the spotlight in stronger fashion than many anticipated. The certainties end there. Woods\u2019s own painful, recurring tales of woe urge caution."
"4||Baby boy found to be alive after Delhi hospital declared him deadPolice in Delhi have launched an investigation after a baby that had been pronounced dead by doctors was found to be moving in a body bag as his parents prepared to deliver funeral rites. Two doctors have been sacked from Delhi\u2019s upmarket Max hospital in Shalimar Bagh, where the boy and his twin sister were born prematurely at 22 weeks last week. The girl was stillborn and the boy was in critical condition; soon afterwards, doctors pronounced him dead. Indian TV showed images of yellow plastic bags in which the bodies were reportedly wrapped by the hospital and returned to the family. \u201cThey handed us both bodies wrapped like a courier package from the back door,\u201d the boy\u2019s grandfather Kailash told NDTV. \u201cAfter we travelled 3km, we felt a movement in one [bag]. We ripped it open, found bits of plastic and the baby inside, breathing.\u201d He said the family had been preparing to perform the last rites in line with Hindu funeral traditions when a relative felt one of the bags wriggling in his lap. The boy, who has been given the name Champ, is on life support at a Delhi nursing home. \u201cThe doctors at the nursing home told us that the boy has several infections because he was exposed to the environment and had been wrapped in plastic,\u201d his uncle told local media. \u201cThey haven\u2019t told us whether he\u2019ll survive.\u201d The incident sparked outrage and protests outside the hospital at the weekend. India\u2019s health minister, JP Nadda, called the incident \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. Delhi\u2019s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, ordered an inquiry and said he would take the \u201cstrongest action\u201d. Max Healthcare said it was \u201cshaken and concerned at this rare incident\u201d and announced on Monday that the two treating doctors would be sacked. Separate inquiries by the hospital and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) are ongoing. Delhi police have said the two doctors are among those being investigated in relation to possible charges of culpable homicide, an offence punishable by up to seven years in jail. KK Aggarwal, the head of the IMA, said the episode was a tragic mistake. \u201cThe difference between a mistake and negligence is deliberate action. I don\u2019t think any doctor will do it wilfully,\u201d he said. In June another Delhi hospital sent a \u201cdead\u201d newborn home in a sealed package, where his family discovered the infant was still alive. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have opened the polythene if it weren\u2019t for the ladies of the family \u2013 they insisted on seeing the boy\u2019s face,\u201d said Rohit Kumar, the child\u2019s father. \u201cWhen we opened the cover we found he was moving his hands and feet.\u201d The premature baby, weighing less than 500g (1lb), was rushed back to hospital but died a short time later."
"4||Ten arrested over murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana GaliziaPolice in Malta have arrested 10 suspects over the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, the country\u2019s prime minister has said, nearly two months after the anti-corruption journalist was killed by a powerful car bomb. Joseph Muscat told a press conference that eight people \u2013 all Maltese nationals, most with criminal records \u2013 had been detained in early-morning raids in three different parts of the island. He tweeted later that two more suspects were also in custody. Muscat said there was a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d the suspects were involved in the killing of Caruana Galizia, whose popular blog attacked high-level political corruption, shady business dealings and organised crime on the island. The joint police and military operation was the first breakthrough for the Maltese investigation, which has been helped by experts from the FBI, Europol and the Finnish and Dutch security services. Police now have 48 hours to interrogate the suspects and either charge or release them. Muscat, who was a frequent target of Caruana Galizia\u2019s blog reports along with others in his inner circle, said he could give no further details of the arrests, the suspects or the evidence against them, but offered his \u201cpersonal commitment\u201d that those responsible for the killing would be found. Caruana Galizia\u2019s son Matthew, who is also a reporter, told the Guardian his family were \u201cin the dark\u201d about the arrests and had been given no further information beyond a phone call from a magistrate\u2019s office after the arrests were made public. At a separate event, the island\u2019s police commissioner, Lawrence Cutajar, refused to take any questions about the arrests, which have been called one of the biggest police operations in Maltese history. They took place in Marsa, where other car bombings have occurred, as well as Zebbug, a village in central Malta, and in the northern town of St Paul\u2019s Bay. A section of Lighters Wharf in the port area of Marsa was still sealed off later on Monday as military personnel and police used sniffer dogs to search buildings. The murder on 16 October sent shockwaves through the island and alarmed the EU, which was already concerned about the rule of law on Malta. The bloc\u2019s smallest member state has often been branded a haven for dubious foreign money. Last week, MEPs visiting Malta on a fact-finding mission said they had arrived \u201cseriously concerned\u201d about the rule of law and were leaving \u201ceven more worried\u201d. They said an apparent reluctance to investigate and prosecute major cases had created a \u201cperception of impunity\u201d. The journalist\u2019s family are taking legal action against the island\u2019s police, saying the investigation into the killing cannot be impartial and independent since Caruana Galizia wrote critical articles about both the senior officer now running it, Silvio Valletta, and his wife, a top government minister. The family have alleged that her murder was a \u201ctargeted killing\u201d of a journalist whose work focused on uncovering \u201ccorruption, criminality, conflicts of interest and ethical failures in decision-making\u201d by politicians and their associates. The family have raised other concerns about the investigation, which they say appears to be focusing only on forensic evidence rather than examining financial transactions that could uncover vital evidence. They also suggest leaks from within the police could intimidate potential informants. The most significant investigations by the murdered journalist stemmed from the Panama Papers, a leak of documents from the archives of the offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca. Malta\u2019s government is offering a \u20ac1m reward for information relating to the killing. A top Italian prosecutor, Carmelo Zuccaro, has said he believes the murder could be linked to an investigation he is leading into a fuel-smuggling operation spanning Libya, Malta and Italy and involving organised crime groups in Sicily. Caruana Galizia wrote about some of those linked to the inquiry. Antonio Di Pietro, an Italian politician and judge who was a prosecutor in Italy\u2019s anti-corruption Mani Pulite corruption trials in the 1990s, said on Monday that Caruana Galizia\u2019s murder had all the hallmarks of a mafia-style killing. \u201cIt was professional and a classic mafia-style homicide,\u201d Di Pietro told the Times of Malta. \u201cThe mafia\u2019s style is intimidation. The target was not only poor Caruana Galizia \u2026 but all those around her because it was a clear warning: be careful or you\u2019ll suffer the same fate.\u201d Responding to a public letter from eight of the world\u2019s largest media organisations including the New York Times, BBC and the Guardian, the first vice-president of the EU commission, Frans Timmermans, last month issued a strong warning to Malta. \u201cThe eyes of Europe are on the Maltese authorities,\u201d Timmermans said. \u201cWe want those directly and indirectly responsible for this horrible murder to be brought to justice.\u201d Additional reporting by Lorenzo Tondo"
"7||Animal agriculture is choking the \u200bEarth and making us sick. We must act nowOur collective minds are stuck on this idea that talking about food\u2019s environmental impact risks taking something very intimate away from us. In fact it\u2019s just the opposite. Reconsidering how we eat offers us hope, and empowers us with choice over what our future planet will look like. And we can ask our local leaders \u2013 from city mayors to school district boards to hospital management \u2013 to help, by widening our food options. On Monday and Tuesday, the city of Chicago is hosting a summit for the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy to discuss climate solutions cities can undertake. Strategies to address and lower food\u2019s impact should be front and center. Animal agriculture is choking the Earth, and the longer we turn a blind eye, the more we limit our ability to nourish ourselves, protect waterways and habitats, and pursue other uses of our precious natural resources. Raising livestock for meat, eggs and milk generates 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the second highest source of emissions and greater than all transportation combined. It also uses about 70% of agricultural land, and is one of the leading causes of deforestation, biodiversity loss, and water pollution. On top of this, eating too much meat and dairy is making us sick, greatly increasing our risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, several major cancers (including breast, liver and prostate) and obesity. Diets optimal for human health vary, according to David Katz, of the Yale University Prevention Research Center, \u201cbut all of them are made up mostly of whole, wholesome plant foods\u201d. So what gives? Why can\u2019t we see the forest for the bacon? The truth can be hard to swallow: that we simply need less meat and dairy and more plant-based options in our food system if we\u2019re to reach our climate goals. This can start with individual action. Five years ago, our family felt hopeless about climate change, and helpless to make meaningful change. But when we connected the dots on animal agriculture\u2019s impact on the environment, coupled with the truth about nutrition, we took heart because it gave us something we could actually do. To create change at the scale needed, this will take more than individual choice \u2013 we need to get climate leaders on board about the impact of food. Cities and counties have used their buying power to transition fleets from diesel to electric, and we need to do the same with how we purchase food. We have done this in our own community, moving the lunch program of Muse School, in Calabasas, California, and the Avatar movie set to plant-based menus. Scaling up initiatives like these can make a big difference: if the US reduced meat consumption by 50%, it\u2019s the equivalent of taking 26 million cars off the road. We think that\u2019s damn hopeful. Decision-makers on all levels can make it easier for us to eat better, by expanding access to food options that are good for our health, affordable, and climate-friendly. Nationwide, cities and school districts have adopted food purchasing policies that include environment, health and fair labor standards. The city of Chicago is a recent adopter of this Good Food Purchasing Program, and so the solutions-focus of the summit is the perfect place to discuss how food can move us toward climate goals. In the same breath that we discuss fossil fuels, we should be talking animal ag, or we\u2019re missing a big part of the problem \u2013 and a big part of the solution. Yes, food is inherently personal. It\u2019s the cornerstone of holidays, it fuels high school athletes and long workdays, and it nourishes nursing mothers and growing children. And yes, Americans love meat and cheese. But more than that, we love our majestic national parks, family beach vacations and clean air and water for our children and grandchildren. As individuals, we can make choices on how to better nourish our families, and as citizens, we can encourage local leaders to make choices that will allow us to enjoy our land and natural resources now and in the future. \u2022 James Cameron is a film-maker and deep-sea explorer.

"10||MoJ scraps legal aid restrictions for victims of domestic violenceTime limits preventing victims of domestic violence from obtaining legal aid for court hearings will be scrapped from January, the Ministry of Justice has announced. The heavily criticised restrictions, which have resulted in large numbers of women confronting abusive ex-partners without representation, will also be relaxed to accept evidence from victim support organisations. The changes deliver on signals that the system would be reformed given by the MoJ and revealed by the Guardian earlier this year. Confirming the new guidelines for the Legal Aid Agency, the justice minister, Dominic Raab, said: \u201cWe have listened to victims\u2019 groups and carefully reviewed the criteria for legal aid for victims of domestic abuse in family cases. \u201cThese changes make sure that vulnerable women and children get legal support so their voice is properly heard in court.\u201d Legal aid has usually been available to victims of domestic violence and child abuse, or those deemed at risk, as long as they could provide evidence of abuse within the past five years. Removal of the five-year limit and admission of fresh categories of evidence will help large numbers of women and some men who have been deprived of legal advice and representation in family court disputes over custody and contact with children. The narrow evidence requirements were first imposed under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act of 2012. The MoJ has launched a broader, formal review of the impact of the legislation on access to justice. The new regulations will be detailed in a statutory instrument put before parliament this week. Statements from domestic violence support organisations and housing support officers will in future be accepted as evidence of past abuse, as well as those from social services, law enforcement agencies and medical professionals. Earlier this year the government announced a \u00a317m fund to support 41 projects across the country to tackle violence against women and girls. Steve Hynes, the director of the Legal Action Group who has campaigned against legal aid cuts, welcomed the change: \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time because of the general election and other delays. I\u2019m very pleased they have made the announcement. \u201cThey realised it\u2019s a priority. It wasn\u2019t working. Women who experienced domestic violence were not qualifying [for representation]. The amount of civil legal aid granted has fallen by 80% since Laspo was introduced.\u201d Elspeth Thomson, chair of the legal aid committee at the family law organisation Resolution, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been calling for changes to the evidence gateway since Laspo was implemented in 2013 and welcome this news. Parliament has committed to protect victims of domestic abuse so ministers have a duty to ensure that those who need legal aid are able to access it. \u201cThese changes, made in consultation with Resolution and others, are a step in the right direction, allowing the justice system to better support at-risk and vulnerable people at perhaps the most difficult time of their lives \u2013 when the family unit is breaking down. \u201cUltimately, these are real people, not statistics, and we must protect them and their access to the justice system.\u201d Estelle du Boulay, the director of the Rights of Women, said: \u201cThe changes \u2026 will make a significant difference to women experiencing or at risk of domestic abuse to access legal aid in private family law cases. \u201cThe previous system was so clearly unjust, leaving many genuine survivors unable to access the legal aid they were entitled to, because the evidence requirements were narrow, onerous and unrealistic. \u201cWe fought the government through the courts to bring in these reforms. We are particularly grateful to the many women survivors who provided testimony that enabled us to prove our case. Their voices have finally been listened to today.\u201d Cris McCurley, a family law lawyer at the law firm Ben Hoare Bell who has sat on the independent advisory group helping the MOJ throughout the review process, said: \u201cIn spite of the UN convention on the elimination of discrimination against women committee ruling that the [UK] government had to urgently review and ensure victims of violence would get legal aid for private family law proceedings in October 2013, these changes have only come about as a result of the hard work, dedication and courage of Rights of Women in pursuing their case against the MOJ on domestic violence eligibility for legal aid all the way to the court of appeal.\u201d The president of the Law Society of England and Wales, Joe Egan, said: \u201cLegal aid is a lifeline for those who have suffered abuse. It is often the only way someone can bring their case before the courts. Today\u2019s positive decision is the end result of work the Law Society and other organisations have been doing with the MoJ for many months.\u201d Sophie Walker, the leader of the Women\u2019s Equality party, said:\u201cThe Ministry of Justice\u2019s decision to lift these damaging restrictions on legal aid is welcome \u2013 and long overdue. \u201cToo many women have been denied justice over the last seven years as a result of the government\u2019s short-sighted cuts.\u201d"
"11||Dave review \u2013 London's most emotionally intelligent teenagerStreatham rapper Dave is just 19 years old. It\u2019s something you have to keep telling yourself, because it\u2019s completely bewildering. On his first headline tour, still to release his debut album, he has a sold-out show of 1,400 fans \u2013 with an average age at least a year younger than him \u2013 singing along to a downbeat, epic state-of-the-nation address about the Grenfell fire, privatised healthcare (his mum is a nurse) and Theresa May (\u201cA question for the new prime minister: how\u2019d you get a heart so sinister?\u201d). He pulls off the same trick on another long and reflective song from his second EP, Game Over \u2013 released a month ago \u2013 called How I Met My Ex, in which he asks his teenage crowd: \u201cHow many men stop their women from achieving what they can, because in secret they\u2019ve been feeling insecure?\u201d Dave broaches these subjects without ever becoming a worthy bore and he\u2019s clearly grateful for the audience\u2019s enthusiasm for his message. \u201cI love jumping around and shouting just as much as you guys,\u201d he says between songs, \u201cbut the fact you can listen to me rap about politics for seven or eight minutes means so, so much to me.\u201d His versatility is a vital strength: for all the ostentatious emotional intelligence, the second half of the show is straight bangers. When the crowd start spontaneously singing the chorus to his latest hit, No Words, he tells them to breathe. \u201cSeriously, take one deep breath with me,\u201d he laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need the energy.\u201d AJ Tracey comes out to tag-team on 2016\u2019s irresistible (and exhausting) Thiago Silva, and the place goes berserk. After that, the Drake-endorsed single Wanna Know \u2013 the version without Drake getting in the way is far superior \u2013 seems to have every one of the crowd singing along. In style, Dave is a classical rapper, as distinct from the lickety-split onslaught of a grime MC like AJ Tracey, or the Auto-Tuned Afrobeats swagger of J Hus or MoStack, who each also guest here, none of them a day older than 23. Compared with the recent solo shows of the latter two, Dave is better drilled, completing all of his bars to perfection. But the fact he brings out all three of them, and performs on their terms, is a sign of how rich London music is now \u2013 and how strikingly talented Dave is."
"17||Z is for zero: share your artwork now\u2018Zero is silence. Zero is the beginning. Zero is round. Zero spins. Zero is the moon. The sun is Zero. Zero is white. The desert Zero. The sky above Zero. The night.\u2019 (excerpt from a 1963 poem by the Zero Group). On 11 April 1957, two young German artists, Otto Piene and Heinz Mack, invited the public into their Dusseldorf studio and, in a series of one-evening exhibitions, proclaimed the zero hour of post-war art. It was a radical, iconoclastic act that gave birth to ZERO, an international network of like-minded artists who shared their aim to redefine art in the aftermath of World War II. The name ZERO was intended to herald a new artistic and historical era, an emancipation from traditional genres and principles of art. Active for just a decade, the movement was to become one of the most important avant-garde movements of the twentieth century. The group developed a new visual language in which light and movement were used to open up new forms of perception. The use of pure colour and kinetic installations of discs of light, monochromatic and simplified forms, were designed to evoke a sense of peace and calm, silence and emptiness, what Piene described as \u201ca zone of silence and of pure possibilities for a new beginning\u201d. ZERO came to an end as dramatic as its beginning, with a party of more than 1,000 spectators on the banks of the Rhine in which they set rolling a flaming wagon in the direction of the river and watched it sink, hissing and cracking in a cloud of bubbling steam, in the inky water. So, Z is for the inspiration and effect of pure light and colour, of simplified shapes and forms in art, where movement is used to create new sensory experiences. An art that creates a sense of stillness and contemplation in which the act of beginning can be sensed. Heinz Mack\u2019s \u2018Light Dynamo\u2019 from 1963 is on display at Tate Modern. Hannah Ryggen\u2019s Woven Histories exhibition is at Modern Art Oxford until 18 February 2018.

"5||Emma Cline\u2019s plagiarism suit \u2013 just another story of a man acting terriblyWhat are we to make of the insane story of author Emma Cline\u2019s ex-boyfriend suing her for plagiarism? Eve, by email Just when you think you\u2019ve reached the limits on toxic masculinity, along comes another story of a man acting terribly and a lot of men around him encouraging him in his terribleness. Emma Cline is the young novelist who wrote The Girls, one of my favourite books of the past five years. She has an ex-boyfriend with the unforgettable name of Chaz Reetz-Laiolo, which I assumed initially was a joke as it sounds so much like the name of a bad stoner boyfriend in a Tarantino movie. Reetz-Laiolo claims that Cline plagiarised fragments of her novel from him by installing spyware in his computer and reading his emails. As it happens, The Girls is loosely based on the Charles Manson story and the really ironic thing about Reetz-Laiolo\u2019s (can we just call him Chaz? Yes, let\u2019s do that) Chaz\u2019s suit is, in its aggression and apparent loopiness, that it doesn\u2019t sound a million miles from the kind of conspiracies Manson used to share with his followers about how Dennis Wilson or Terry Melcher had \u201cbetrayed\u201d him and were preventing the world from seeing his genius. Anyway, one of Chaz\u2019s lawyers is a certain David Boies, who worked briefly for Harvey Weinstein. Last summer, Boies sent Cline\u2019s lawyers dozens of screenshots of intimate online conversations Cline had had with various men in the past because this proved, according to Boies, that Cline is \u201cnot the innocent or naif she portrayed herself to be\u201d, as though that has anything to do with writing a book. Boies insisted this was in response to Cline describing Chaz as \u201cabusive\u201d (he has denied accusations of physical abuse), as though, again, Cline having previous relationships does anything to disprove that allegation. One of the lawyers representing Cline, Carrie Goldberg, told the New Yorker last week that what Chaz\u2019s lawyers were saying was, \u201cHey, if you don\u2019t give us what our client wants, we\u2019re going to put this very personal information out into the open, and the whole world is going to know the inner workings of your sex life and your sexual history and every proclivity that you have.\u201d Boies\u2019s firm responded by saying that Cline\u2019s lawyers were the first to raise aspects of the parties\u2019 sexual history. After Boies\u2019 work for Weinstein had been exposed by the New Yorker, his law firm, Boies Schiller, sent an amendedment to their original draft to Cline\u2019s lawyers with the references to Cline\u2019s sex life removed, and now both Cline and Chaz are suing one another. There is so much I\u2019d like to say about this case but, apparently, I\u2019m not allowed. So let me instead just end with these thoughts. To quote the late, great Nora Ephron: women, never marry a man you wouldn\u2019t want to be divorced from. If that guy has anger issues, or ego issues, or self-pity issues, or is just your garden-variety sociopathic narcissist, then do not go there. Only date kind men. Feel free, in 20 years time, to send me all the money this advice saves you, as it will spare you years of expensive therapy, binge drinking and yoga retreats. But it\u2019s really you I\u2019m looking at, men, and here is my message to you: the world does not owe you, or your egos, or your dicks, any favours. Get over yourselves. As for Cline herself, I wish her all the success she so clearly deserves. And most of all, I wish her to be spared of any more men called Chaz blocking her sunny path. Words for us all to live by. Surely \u2013 surely! \u2013 we are done with famous men being exposed as sexual harassers, right? Suzanne, New York I mean, you would think so, Suzanne. We\u2019re getting to the point where pretty much only Mr Snuffleupagus and Mister Rogers are left blameless in American TV land, and my hands tremble typing those words, as if tempting fate (heaven knows where Snuffy\u2019s trump has been, and don\u2019t even get me started on the mysteries of Mister Rogers\u2019 closet). But we are missing the obvious one, the guy who so obviously should be named, shamed and sacked now, and everyone\u2019s response would be, \u201cWell of COURSE he\u2019s gross with women. Everyone knew that! It\u2019s amazing he lasted so long. Yes, this all makes total sense.\u201d I speak, of course, of Donald Trump. It is one of those remarkable quirks of history \u2013 and how many there seem to be these days \u2013 that if Trump had never run for president, if he were still just playing a fake boss on a reality TV show, he would, no question, be out of the job now. If American network NBC was willing to ditch Matt Lauer, long-term morning news anchor, then it definitely would have been willing to chuck Trump, star of their show The Apprentice. Trump, lest we forget, has been accused for decades of harassing and assaulting women \u2013 20, I believe, at the last count (Trump, predictably, says they\u2019re all lying). So yes, if we hadn\u2019t slipped out of the wrong timeline \u2013 she says, making like Doc Brown in Back to the Future Part II and getting out her chalk and blackboard \u2013 then Trump would be up there with Charlie Rose, Geraldo Rivera and all those other 80s throwbacks who, for some reason, are still on American TV despite having the personality of a giant tongue, and are now, to no one\u2019s surprise, being accused of sexual harassment. And yet, we are at the point in America where the ethical standards are higher for morning TV presenters than they are for the president. Thus the people who churn out garbage such as A Bad Moms Christmas now look like America\u2019s moral arbiters and the people ostensibly running the country make invertebrates look upstanding. So, you ask, who on Earth is left, Suzanne? Donald J Trump, that\u2019s who. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 he ain\u2019t going anywhere."
"18||When good TV goes bad: why House's self-medication got the better of himWhen Dr Gregory House \u2013 played with sardonic relish by Hugh Laurie \u2013 first limped on to our screens in 2004, he was the fulcrum of a fresh, inventive medical drama. The sharp-tongued sociopath lodged into brains like a tapeworm (which actually happened in the pilot). The show\u2019s simple formula made for a thrilling watch: a patient with bizarre symptoms \u2013 hearing colours, for example \u2013 seeks help. They are insulted by a macabre doctor with wit and verve until a genius deduction occurs in the last act and they are cured. House paved the way for procedural dramas with unlikable savant main characters, including Sherlock, Elementary, Psych and The Mentalist. Left with a limp and in constant pain due to a misdiagnosis earlier in life, House only cares about two things: getting the diagnosis right, and where his next fix of pain-numbing drugs will come from. He cares not for the human beyond the mystery. At first it\u2019s easy to forgive his cruelty because of his ability to say the things we all would like to (although he\u2019s more than a little extreme in his narcissistic thoughts). Unfortunately, however, as the limits of plausibility are strained after the show\u2019s season-four peak, it\u2019s the viewer who wants to pop a handful of Vicodins to take the pain away. In season five, House doesn\u2019t so much jump the shark as hallucinate one that\u2019s rainbow-coloured and speaking in tongues. Due to his constant grazing on mind-altering drugs, our antihero develops visions of his best friend\u2019s dead girlfriend, whose advice leads to House setting fire to a corpse, performing surgery on an unwilling patient, and poisoning a colleague via a stripper\u2019s strawberry body butter. Mental illness is played here for uncomfortable laughs, and the season ends with House being taken to a mental institution. Where once we could depend on an exploding testicle to propel episodes forward, we were now privy to more information than we wanted about House\u2019s personal life. Would House give up medicine for cookery? Would House and his boss Dr Lisa Cuddy date? Would House find a house? All these non-questions and more are explored in exhaustive detail. One later episode also revolves around a now apparently sane House\u2019s attempt to win a potato-launching competition against a teenager. In previous series, he would do extraordinarily dangerous things to save a patient, but now he did them for shock, such as hiring a child actor to pretend to be his best friend\u2019s long-lost son. When his relationship with Cuddy fails he drives a car into her apartment. Nearly slaughtering a dinner party because of a broken heart fits nowhere into what we had thought we knew about the ultra-logical misog. In an episode long after the show\u2019s prime, we are teased with images of House leaping from a hotel balcony. The viewer is hoping for an appropriately dramatic end to our once-proud font of brutal honesty. Instead, it\u2019s a classic anticlimax from a show that used to never pull its punches. House plunges into a swimming pool to the applause of a crowd of six-packed jocks at a college party. Jump the shark or dive into the pool? In the end it amounted to the same thing, really."
"11||Liam Gallagher review \u2013 the last great rock'n'roll starMusic writer David Hepworth\u2019s recent book, Uncommon People: The Rise and Fall of the Rock Stars, pronounces the era of the rock star over. Nirvana\u2019s Kurt Cobain \u2013 who committed suicide in April 1994, a week before Oasis released their first single, Supersonic \u2013 is described as \u201cpossibly the last one\u201d. If this is so, nobody appears to have told Liam Gallagher. The former Oasis frontman struts on, all swagger and attitude, as if fresh from an argument with a traffic warden. His first words to the crowd rejig the Beatles\u2019 I Am the Walrus: \u201cHiya, you are Leeds and we are all together.\u201d He kicks a fan (of the mechanical, not audience, kind) and starts singing: \u201cTonight, I\u2019m a rock\u2019n\u2019roll star.\u201d And for the next 90 exhilarating minutes, he is exactly that. It\u2019s not immediately obvious what Gallagher has got that so many other performers haven\u2019t. Unusually, for a star at arena level, there\u2019s not much of a show. The occasional strobe aside, the only real concession to theatrics is the phrase \u201cRock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d daubed across a white organ (a knowing homage to the lost, great Manchester band World of Twist, whose stage act incorporated the same slogan in the early 90s). Indeed, for almost the entire performance, we\u2019re watching a 45-year-old man in a coat, who sings while rooted to the spot. And yet, every movement seems to radiate raw power and energy as guitars and drums rage around him. The eye is inexplicably drawn to him, all the time (his scarlet coat, while the musicians are all in black, certainly helps). At the end of the song, he spits out his own explanation of his magnetic otherness: \u201cNone of the fuckin\u2019 plastic pop star!\u201d Being able to draw on an era-defining Oasis classic such as (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory? as early as the second song certainly adds a frisson. But when people \u2013 many half his age \u2013 gawp up at Gallagher in the same way small children gaze at a T-rex skeleton in a museum, they do so in the knowledge that we may not see his like again: a rock singer whose band rocketed from playing to the bar staff at the nearby Duchess pub to Knebworth, and the biggest gigs of the 90s, inside three mercurial years. However, this show doesn\u2019t feel nostalgic. If Gallagher\u2019s supersonic confidence took a knock after the flop of his post-Oasis band, Beady Eye, it\u2019s surely rocketing again after his solo debut album As You Were outsold the rest of the Top 20 combined in October (and shipped more than brother Noel\u2019s current No 1). Half of his set still consists of Oasis songs, penned by his estranged sibling, but as Liam recently pointed out on Twitter: \u201cHe wrote \u2019em, I made \u2019em.\u201d With his voice recovering a long lost octave, the likes of Some Might Say and Supersonic are roaring jets, but the solo songs hold their own. With Gallagher\u2019s voice a perfect mix of two Johns \u2013 Lydon and Lennon \u2013 they are either spikily vitriolic (Greedy Soul, You Better Run and Wall of Glass) or more wistfully emotional (Bold and For What It\u2019s Worth). The last \u2013 reputedly an apology to ex-wife Nicole Appleton and already a crowd singalong \u2013 is as great an anthem as he has sung in 20 years. He then turns impeccable curator of his catalogue, turning a 1995 B-side, Rockin\u2019 Chair \u2013 surely the greatest \u201clost\u201d Oasis song of all \u2013 into a reflective celebration of survival. Be Here Now is recovered from the scrapyard of lesser-loved later Oasis songs and turned into a showstopper, with the crowd boosting the \u201cyeah yeah yeah\u201d refrain. Throughout, pints are raised, couples (straight and gay) hug and chants of \u201cLiam! Liam!\u201d echo around the arena. The Mancunian is in good humour, commenting on the venue\u2019s no-swearing commandment (\u201cFuck that\u201d) and responding to a chant of \u201cYorkshire! Yorkshire!\u201d with a pithy, \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing against Yorkshire but calm down. You\u2019ve got good tea.\u201d The audience erupts for the encore of Cigarettes and Alcohol, and the line \u201cIs it worth the aggravation, to find yourself a job, when there\u2019s nothing worth working for\u201d sounds as relevant as ever in the era of zero-hours contracts. Live Forever is delivered in a beautiful new arrangement, complete with cello. Then, with the house lights up, Sid Vicious\u2019s version of My Way blaring out and the crowd filing out, Gallagher suddenly bounds back on. \u201cHad you there, didn\u2019t I?\u201d he cackles, and delivers a perfect Wonderwall before exiting as he entered, applauding the applause, and every inch the rock\u2019n\u2019roll star. At the SSE Hydro, Glasgow, on 4 December. Box office: 0844 395 4000. Then touring."
"1||Peter St\u00f6ger leaves with his head held high at crucial juncture for CologneIn a way it ended just as it was supposed to, with honour. As Peter St\u00f6ger took his final bow in front of the K\u00f6ln fans who had travelled to Schalke on Saturday, doffing his cap, he was given the warm send-off his work over the last four-and-a-half years has deserved. Teenage defender Tim Handwerker wasn\u2019t the only player wiping tears from his eyes as they said goodbye to the coach. When the team coach arrived back at Rhein-Energie Stadion on Saturday evening, a throng of fans applauded St\u00f6ger off as he emerged. Quite rightly. Only the legendary Hennes Weisweiler \u2013 who gave his name to the club\u2019s famous billy goat mascot \u2013 had been at the helm longer. When St\u00f6ger\u2019s immediate replacement Stefan Ruthenbeck, who steps up from the under-19s until the winter break at least, said: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to fill his shoes\u201d after Sunday\u2019s training session, he was not overstating. \u201cThey are too big to fill, anyway,\u201d Ruthenbeck concluded. As Ruthenbeck starts the new week, there will be two training sessions on Monday as he attempts to galvanise the squad with a bit of tough love. For while St\u00f6ger\u2019s last hurrah on the Effzeh bench was a worthy one \u2013 as they gutsily twice came back from a deficit to prise a point from Gelsenkirchen \u2013 and his name deserves to be cherished in the context of the club\u2019s history, the new coach has a steep climb to negotiate. Even after Saturday\u2019s game against an in-form side, K\u00f6ln sit bottom with no wins and only three points. No team in Bundesliga history has stayed up with such a low tally at the same stage. Seyrou Guirassy\u2019s brace at Schalke is responsible for a third of their league goals, and statistically they have the worst defence (conceding 27) as well as the weakest attack. Given that St\u00f6ger\u2019s team had the sixth-best defence last season, with 42 scored against them, their form at the back is perhaps even more concerning than their lack of punch up top. At least there\u2019s an easy explanation for the latter with Anthony Modeste, scorer of almost exactly half their Bundesliga goals last season and of 40 league goals in two campaigns, having left for Tianjin Quanjian. If this season had been about regression to the mean, that would be fair enough. The delirium of the club\u2019s return after 25 years, wildly celebrated in this most optimistic of footballing cities, long kept scrutiny of the team\u2019s domestic form on the back burner. Too much so, perhaps, as things have spiralled out of control. It\u2019s great to see a team embrace the Europa League rather than moan about it, but when even at crisis point on Saturday, local attentions quickly switched to Thursday\u2019s \u2018decisive\u2019 tie in Belgrade against Crvena Zvezda (Red Star Belgrade), you couldn\u2019t help but ask if more attention to the home front might not be in order. That is surely inevitable now, but it could be too late. This is a passionately followed club but a volatile one, where wobbles can quickly be followed by a descent into chaos. Sunday\u2019s press conference to announce St\u00f6ger going was a nod to this, with president Werner Spinner and managing director Alexander Wehrle on one hand laudably frank and on the other perhaps too open about the doubt that has existed. Sporting director J\u00f6rg Schmadtke went on 24 October, and K\u00f6ln have appeared to drift ever since. Wehrle admitted they told St\u00f6ger they were looking at alternative candidates in early November, after the loss to Hoffenheim. In the days following another home defeat to Hertha, they let him know they were moving on \u2013 three weeks after initially marking his card. The city\u2019s newspaper Express, which broke the news of St\u00f6ger\u2019s exit on Saturday night, also reported ex-Hamburg man Dietmar Beiersdorfer as the new frontrunner to replace Schmadtke after he was spotted in town. \u201cMaybe he was here for the Christmas market?\u201d Spinner suggested glibly. This appointment is more than window dressing. In fact, the appointment of the right sporting director is arguably even more important than the next coach. Horst Heldt, Hannover\u2019s K\u00f6ln-born sporting director, had been expected to take over but his release couldn\u2019t be negotiated. The new man, whether Beiersdorfer or someone else, is going to have play a blinder in this transfer window to give St\u00f6ger\u2019s successor at least a fighting chance of staying up, because the current squad simply don\u2019t look capable. To (at least nominally) replace Modeste, Jhon C\u00f3rdoba was brought in from Mainz. The Colombian has plenty of merit, but never stood a chance of matching the Frenchman\u2019s goal output. The widespread perception was that the club had wasted \u20ac15m on a forward who had never scored more than five in a league season. Money was spent for the future, bringing in Jorge Mer\u00e9 and Jannes Horn, but the present looks bleak with so much confidence drained. In that sense, maybe European qualification could be a fillip rather than mere placebo. The coaching search will not be straightforward either, with the club\u2019s preferred candidate Markus Anfang (another K\u00f6ln native) of Bundesliga 2 leaders Holsten Kiel apparently held to an enormous \u20ac10m release clause by the club\u2019s president Steffen Schneekloth. Perhaps by default, Ruthenbeck has an opportunity to carve himself a future. It\u2019s extraordinary to think that, had the timing been slightly different, 51-year-old Austrian St\u00f6ger could have been in charge at Dortmund. He belatedly made BVB\u2019s three-man shortlist to replace Thomas Tuchel \u2013 a list that has proved a kiss of death, with all three enduring difficult starts to the campaign. The talk in France was that Lucien Favre, Dortmund\u2019s first choice in the summer, was set for the boot had Nice lost at Toulouse on Wednesday (they eventually scored twice in the last 10 minutes to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 win). Peter Bosz\u2019s own struggles are well documented, of course. St\u00f6ger could well bounce back in time, and few would argue against that being a good thing. He pulled K\u00f6ln up from the second tier, stabilised them and took them to the giddy heights of fifth last season, earning himself an impromptu champagne bath from his giddy players in his final post-match press conference of the season. It\u2019s sad that it all fell apart, but those travelling fans at the weekend know exactly what he did, and will continue to remember the good times. Talking points \u2022 Bosz is still in work, with Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc saying after the 1-1 draw at Leverkusen that \u201cwe want to achieve a turnaround with Bosz,\u201d but they really played with fire. The coach might owe Wendell a bottle of something bubbly after the defender\u2019s red card for a dreadful tackle on Gonzalo Castro just before half-time helped stem the Leverkusen flow. Until then, it had been fortune and a magnificent display from the maligned Roman B\u00fcrki that kept Heiko Herrlich\u2019s side to a one-goal lead. Andriy Yarmolenko\u2019s equaliser gives Bosz something to work with, though the additions of Maximilian Philipp and Castro to a big injury list are added headaches before the trip to Real Madrid. \u2022 Again, Bayern Munich extended their lead at the top \u2013 now six points \u2013 without excelling themselves. They had to battle to beat Hannover, but there were two big picture pluses for Jupp Heynckes. Thomas M\u00fcller was sublime on his return from six weeks out with a muscle injury, while Franck Rib\u00e9ry was also back to play his 235th Bundesliga game for the club, becoming the club\u2019s leading foreign appearance maker in the league. Andr\u00e9 Breitenreiter\u2019s side could consider themselves a touch unlucky, denied an equaliser at 1-0 when Nicklas Fullkrug was harshly made to take a penalty again after scoring, before missing the retake. \u2022 Bayern have Hoffenheim to thank for their cushion, with Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s side excellent in dismantling Leipzig 4-0. They also did FC Hollywood a turn in beginning to get the best out of loanee Serge Gnabry after an injury-affected start to the season \u2013 the former Werder man scored twice, including a sublime chip from some 45 yards with Peter Gulacsi not even that far off his line. \u2022 It was after the Lord Mayor\u2019s Show for M\u00f6nchengladbach at Wolfsburg, where Dieter Hecking\u2019s current side fell to his old one and became the latest victims of the Bayern curse \u2013 the last nine sides to have beaten the behemoth in the Bundesliga have gone on to lose their following match. All credit to Martin Schmidt\u2019s team, however, who were excellent and have now lost just one of 10 games under a coach not greeted by universal approval. \u2022 Kevin-Prince Boateng\u2019s beautifully struck late winner at former club Hertha helped his present one, Eintracht Frankfurt, establish the best away record. Three cheers too for Augsburg, whose win at Mainz \u2013 incorporating two fine finishes from Alfred Finnbogason \u2013 put them level on points with sixth-placed Dortmund. There was also more fuel to the campaign for Philipp Max to get a Germany call-up, after his seventh assist of the season from left-back. \u2022 It\u2019s now two home wins in two for Werder Bremen\u2019s interim coach Florian Kohfeldt, with Max Kruse hitting a stylish winner to beat Stuttgart after quick thinking by Fin Bartels, who played him in from a free-kick. The points were even more vital after fellow strugglers Freiburg and Hamburg cancelled each other out in a tense goalless draw. Results: Hertha Berlin 1-2 Eintracht Frankfurt, Wolfsburg 3-0 M\u00f6nchengladbach, Mainz 1-3 Augsburg, Leverkusen 1-1 Dortmund, Bayern 3-1 Hanover, Schalke 2-2 Cologne, Hoffenheim 4-0 Leipzig, Werder Bremen 1-0 Stuttgart, Freiburg 0-0 Hamburg."
"13||'I feel badly for General Flynn': Trump sympathizes with disgraced former aideDonald Trump said on Monday he \u201cfeels badly\u201d for his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty last week to lying to the FBI, and claimed without evidence that Hillary Clinton \u201clied many times\u201d to the agency without consequences. The president spoke after John Dowd, a lawyer who sought to take the blame for a Trump tweet which analysts said indicated the president was guilty of obstruction of justice over Flynn\u2019s firing, offered a new defence of Trump\u2019s actions: the president cannot obstruct justice. Trump\u2019s remarks to reporters before a trip to Utah were the latest in a series of outbursts over the investigation into his campaign\u2019s alleged collusion with Russia, after Flynn\u2019s guilty plea and admission that he is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cI feel badly for General Flynn,\u201d the president said. \u201cI feel very badly. He\u2019s led a very strong life, and I feel very badly about it. I will say this: Hillary Clinton lied many times to the FBI and nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it destroyed his life, and I think it\u2019s a shame.\u201d Trump added: \u201cHillary Clinton on 4 July weekend went to the FBI, not under oath \u2013 it was the most incredible thing anyone has ever seen \u2013 lied many times, nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it\u2019s like \u2013 it ruined his life. It\u2019s very unfair.\u201d Trump did not provide details about his accusation against Clinton, who answered FBI questions in July 2016 about her use of a private server while she was secretary of state. The FBI never asserted that Clinton made false statements. Flynn, a retired general who was a senior adviser in Trump\u2019s campaign and his first national security adviser, has pledged to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether Trump\u2019s associates coordinated with Russian efforts to sway last year\u2019s election in the Republican\u2019s favour. As part of the deal, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, during the presidential transition. Experts told the Guardian the wording of his plea agreement suggested he may already have been wearing a wire or recording conversations with other figures in the investigation. Trump took aim at the FBI over the weekend, accusing it of bias in favour of Clinton during its investigation of her, which resulted in criticism but no charges. He questioned the direction of the agency and wrote that after director James Comey, whom Trump fired in May, the FBI\u2019s reputation is \u201cin Tatters worst in History!\u201d He vowed to \u201cbring it back to greatness\u201d. Flynn was forced to resign in February after it emerged that he misled vice-president Mike Pence over discussions with Kislyak about sanctions on Russia. Trump said in a tweet on Saturday that he fired Flynn \u201cbecause he lied to the vice-president and the FBI\u201d about his conversations with the ambassador last December. The tweet could signal the president took part in the obstruction of justice. If Trump did fire Flynn for lying to the FBI, that would mean the president knew Flynn had committed a serious crime when, according to the Comey, the president asked Comey the next day to halt an FBI investigation into Flynn. Dowd, the lawyer who said he had written the tweet, told Axios on Monday: \u201cThe president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the constitution\u2019s article II] and has every right to express his view of any case.\u201d Any suggestion the Trump tweet had admitted obstruction of justice, whoever wrote it, would he said be \u201can ignorant and arrogant assertion\u201d. Bob Bauer, a New York University law professor and former White House counsel to Barack Obama, was quoted by Axios as saying: \u201cIt is certainly possible for a president to obstruct justice. \u201cThe case for immunity has its adherents, but they based their position largely on the consideration that a president subject to prosecution would be unable to perform the duties of the office, a result that they see as constitutionally intolerable.\u201d In his original attempt to contain the fallout from the Saturday tweet, Dowd told Reuters \u201cthe mistake was I should have put the lying to the FBI in a separate line referencing his plea. Instead, I put it together and it made all you guys go crazy. A tweet is a shorthand.\u201d Dowd said the first time the president knew for a fact Flynn lied to the FBI was when he was charged. It was the first and last time he would craft a tweet for the president, he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I misled people.\u201d Talking to NBC, he added: \u201cI\u2019m out of the tweeting business. I did not mean to break news.\u201d The suggestion that Dowd wrote the tweet was met with incredulity by Democrats and legal experts. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, wrote: \u201cAnyone who buys Trump\u2019s lawyer\u2019s alibi for his corruptly treacherous client is a complete fool.\u201d Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer in the White House of George W Bush, said: \u201cA lawyer who writes a tweet like that incriminating a client should be disbarred. He can tell Mueller he wrote it.\u201d To some critics, Dowd\u2019s denial that the president can obstruct justice carried echoes of Richard Nixon\u2019s assertion, to David Frost in 1977, that \u201cwhen the president does it, that means it is not illegal\u201d. Others pointed out that the articles of impeachment against Nixon opened with the charge that he \u201cobstructed, and impeded the administration of justice\u201d. The White House has yet to comment. Trump denies that he pressured Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, told reporters on Monday it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to suggest that Flynn\u2019s conversation with the ambassador could have influenced Putin\u2019s thinking."

"6||MPs call on competition watchdog to probe energy giant mergerAn influential group of MPs has called on the competition watchdog to investigate the merger of two of the UK\u2019s biggest energy companies, warning it threatens to be a bad deal for households. The intervention by the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee adds to the mounting pressure for an inquiry into SSE and npower combining to create an energy giant that will shrink the \u201cbig six\u201d suppliers to five. The GMB union recently said ministers should step in and block the merger if the competition watchdog fails to act. Rachel Reeves, chair of the BEIS committee, said: \u201cThe energy market isn\u2019t working for consumers. The proposed merger between SSE and npower risks damaging the development of a more competitive energy market, reducing consumer choice, and threatening to be a bad deal for energy consumers.\u201d The Labour MP has written to to Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, saying it was \u201cconcerning\u201d that the merger could undermine the market\u2019s competitiveness. \u201cThe merger would reduce the big six energy companies to five, with almost half of the domestic energy share held between British Gas and the proposed SSE-npower merged business,\u201d wrote Reeves. The chair urged the watchdog to look in detail at the possible impacts on the market and fully investigate the risk of reduced competition. Npower and SSE are in discussions with the CMA. The new firm would have more electricity customers than any other supplier and be only around 1m customer accounts behind market leader British Gas, which has been shedding hundreds of thousands of customers in recent months. An SSE spokesperson said: \u201cThe merger will improve competition by offering customers a completely new model combining the resources of established players with the agility and innovation of an independent supplier \u2013 turning 60 competitors into 59, not five, and ultimately offering better value for customers.\u201d A spokesperson for npower owner Innogy said: \u201cThe transaction will create a new, strong and independent British retail energy supplier, which will provide a better deal for consumers and help deliver the government\u2019s plans for more competition in the market.\u201d A CMA spokesperson said: \u201cWe will consider all mergers that meet the legal criteria for an investigation under the Enterprise Act.\u201d The BEIS committee is also tasked with scrutinising the government\u2019s draft legislation for an energy bills price cap, which is expected to take effect at the start of 2019, around the time the npower and SSE hope to wrap up a merger. The merger could also potentially be investigated by the European commission competition body. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."
"1||Mark Clattenburg says he \u2018allowed Spurs to self-destruct\u2019 and hand Leicester titleMark Clattenburg has said he \u201callowed Tottenham to self-destruct\u201d with the way he refereed the club\u2019s draw at Chelsea which handed Leicester City the title in May 2016. Clattenburg booked nine Spurs players in the 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge but says he could have sent off up to three. The former Premier League official has explained that he went in with a \u201cgameplan\u201d which would avoid him being blamed for deciding the title. \u201cI allowed them [Tottenham] to self-destruct so all the media, all the people in the world went: \u2018Tottenham lost the title,\u2019\u201d Clattenburg told NBC\u2019s Men in Blazers podcast. \u201cIf I sent three players off from Tottenham, what are the headlines? \u2018Clattenburg cost Tottenham the title.\u2019 It was pure theatre that Tottenham self-destructed against Chelsea and Leicester won the title.\u201d Tottenham led 2-0 at Stamford Bridge and needed to win to retain a chance of overhauling Leicester. Their midfielder Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 received a six-match ban from the Football Association for gouging one of the eyes of the then Chelsea striker Diego Costa. Spurs were two goals ahead when that incident, which went unpunished on the night, occurred. Both clubs were fined for failing to control their players. \u201cI helped the game,\u201d Clattenburg added. \u201cI certainly benefited the game by my style of refereeing. Some referees would have played by the book; Tottenham would have been down to seven or eight players and probably lost and they would\u2019ve been looking for an excuse. But I didn\u2019t give them an excuse, because my gameplan was: let them lose the title.\u201d"
"29||'We'll see the battle lines': Trump faced by Native American alliance over Bears EarsOn Monday, Donald Trump will visit Salt Lake City. He is expected to formally announce plans to substantially shrink two Utah national monuments: Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears. A review of national monuments was conducted by the interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, who recommended changes to 10 such areas. In seeking to open up more land for development and extractive industries, Trump has the support of Utah\u2019s all-Republican congressional delegation. Orrin Hatch, the senator who invited Trump to Utah, said in a video statement the \u201coutcome\u201d the president will announce \u201cstrikes an excellent balance where everybody wins\u201d. Thousands of demonstrators, however, gathered at the state capitol on Saturday in a show of solidarity with Native American tribes that say the move against Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante is nothing less than a \u201cmonumental mistake\u201d. A coalition of five Utah tribes with ties to the land \u2013 the Navajo Nation, Ute Mountain Ute, Ute Indian Tribe, Hopi and the Pueblo of Zuni \u2013 has vowed to oppose any shrinkage of the national monument. Before the formation of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, in 2015, the tribes had never come together. Their leaders say legal action is likely if Trump announces a reduction. Shaun Chapoose, councilman of the Ute Indian Tribe business committee, said this was a significant moment for Native Americans. Many citizens mobilized around tribes opposing the Dakota Access pipeline and alliances were forged around Bears Ears. Despite reverses suffered by the Dakota Access protesters, he said, he sees a reawakening of hope. \u201cIndian country is coming out of its sleep,\u201d Chapoose said. \u201cIt\u2019s given an opportunity for us to voice concerns, and it\u2019s made it OK for tribes to talk amongst themselves, like they used to do a long time ago. \u201cAt one time, there was this big network of communication going on between tribes. After the reservations system, they got isolated from surrounding neighbors. Bears Ears has brought that back where it didn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s brought Indian Country back together.\u201d Chapoose said that in backing extractive industry over preservation and Native American communities, the Trump administration had drawn a line in the sand. \u201cIt\u2019s another slap in the face in the overall relationship between the federal government and the tribes, and local people,\u201d he said. Chapoose said the issue had led locally to a polarization between supporters of the monument and people who want the freedom to use the land for mining, logging and riding off-road vehicles. \u201cIt\u2019s turned us back into cowboys and Indians again,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tension is higher than it started but it hasn\u2019t reached a plateau. That\u2019s going to happen Monday. Then we\u2019ll see the battle lines.\u201d Davis Filfred, the son of a medicine man and a Navajo Nation council delegate, said he did not want to see Bears Ears become like his tribe\u2019s land, which he said had been contaminated by fossil fuel development. Coalmining in the Four Corners area, he said, offers a cautionary tale. \u201cThere is no reclamation, they scarred the whole Mother Earth,\u201d Filfred said. \u201cThe way I see it, they\u2019re going to bulldoze Bears Ears, and there will be nothing there. We\u2019ll tell the next generation, \u2018You see that ash pit over there, that\u2019s where Bears Ears was. Now it\u2019s a uranium mine.\u2019 \u201cMoney cannot replace what we have in terms of wilderness area. It\u2019s habitat to many species, plants and medicinal and ceremonial herbs. You can\u2019t wipe all those away.\u201d Filfred said his Navajo people would continue to hold ceremonies on the land. \u201cMore than 150 years ago, the federal government removed our ancestors from Bears Ears at gunpoint and sent them on the Long Walk, but we came back,\u201d he said, in press release issued by the Native American Rights Fund. \u201cThe president\u2019s proposal is an attack on tribes and will be remembered as equally disgraceful but once again we will be back,\u201d said Filfred, a military veteran who served in the Gulf. \u201cWe know how to persist, we know how to fight and we will fight to defend Bears Ears.\u201d \u2018Somebody listened\u2019 Bears Ears was designated by Barack Obama days before he left office, as the first national monument to be requested by native tribes. Regina Lopez-Whiteskunk of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe was in the waiting room at the doctor\u2019s office when she took the call from the federal government. When she thinks of that moment, she cries. \u201cAfter all of our hard work and time, somebody listened,\u201d she said. \u201cAs Native Americans, we are accustomed to being put aside, on the back-burner, being a check mark on someone\u2019s list. No real change is ever achieved, and yet it was being achieved. I was extremely happy, I was crying, but I knew no matter who was in office after that, we would have to defend that monument.\u201d Lopez-Whiteskunk was one of the founding co-chairs of the coalition that seeks to defend Bears Ears. \u201cWe are very distinct, sovereign tribes,\u201d Lopez-Whiteskunk said, adding that some tribes were historic enemies and some were not accustomed to women being in the circle of leaders. \u201cWhen we came together in this unprecedented fashion, we healed our relationships so we could pursue a common goal. At the end of the day, what we held in common was that our identities are tied to the land. A part of a culture is recorded on the land \u2013 written on the walls of the canyon.\u201d It is estimated that Bears Ears holds more than 100,000 Native American cultural and archaeological sites, including petroglyphs, pottery, tools and ancestral Pueblo dwellings. Sacred sites have been threatened by looting and vandalism. The hope was that national monument status would preserve and protect the land from desecration as well as potential development by the energy industry. \u201cIf some oil rig comes out to explore and eventually develop, they have just ripped out the page of my heritage textbook,\u201d Lopez-Whiteskunk said. \u201cYou take that away, you take our language.\u201d Native Americans are caretakers of the land not just for tribes but for all American citizens, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many wide-open spaces in our country with the large demand to develop,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably one of our biggest threats right now as a country.\u201d Lopez-Whiteskunk said she was not surprised by the turn of events under Trump, but still found it disheartening. \u201cI spent a large part in service to my people invested in this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hurts. It\u2019s like watching someone trying to undo a wonderful deed that you\u2019ve done \u2013 not just for Native Americans, but for all US citizens \u2013 what we worked so hard on to be targeted for destruction.\u201d No matter what happens on Monday, she said, or in the future, it will not diminish the historic achievement of having Bears Ears declared a national monument. \u201cSo many times, our history gets told, monumental decisions get decided for us, but we took it into our hands,\u201d Lopez-Whiteskunk said. \u201cHistory will tell that story, and we were the owners of that destiny. Nobody will ever take that away.\u201d This article was amended on 4 December 2017 to correct Shaun Chapoose\u2019s title."
"7||Would a gay monarch cure the church of its homophobia?A news story would have to be pretty special to bring together the royal family and gay liberation, so well done to the Very Rev Kelvin Holdsworth, who took a hearty stab at marrying the two last week. He called on Christians to pray for Prince George to be gay in the hope that the presence of a gay king would render the Church of England\u2019s institutional homophobia inert. It\u2019s a remarkable reach and so naturally his fringe opinion received extensive coverage. In his blog post \u2013 a sort of manifesto for curing the church\u2019s homophobia \u2013 he suggests that a royal same-sex wedding \u201cmight sort things out remarkably easily\u201d, though he caveats this with the suggestion that such a scenario could take a quarter of a century to play out. It\u2019s worth pointing out first that royal weddings are an utterly ridiculous spectacle. Having two men or two women take the lead roles at Westminster Abbey would simply make these anachronistic displays of pomp and circumstance feel a bit more normal. The only real benefactor of that would be the royal family itself, which \u2013 despite being the least progressive aspect of British society \u2013 would get to align its brand with progressive values. But that\u2019s where its influence ends. Social attitudes and legislative equality have shifted further than the royal family could take them. They are the flag-bearer of conservative family values, but the traditional rights of family life have been won (largely without their help). The monarch\u2019s symbolic acceptance of them would be just that. Beyond the superficial optics, a royal same-sex wedding would have minimal tangible effect on the everyday lives of gay people in the UK. The higher levels of homelessness among the gay community would remain. Austerity, which disproportionately affects LGBT people, would still be in place. Hate crimes against LGBT people wouldn\u2019t become any less regular. A same-sex royal wedding would stop homophobia no more than Prince Harry marrying Meghan Markle will end Britain\u2019s inherent racism. Predictably, if a same-sex royal marriage were held tomorrow, the UK wouldn\u2019t even want it. In a YouGov poll published last week 41% of the population found the very idea of one unacceptable. The survey looked at how attitudes were affected by different attributes of the royal consort, such as ethnicity, age, religion and nationality; the royal couple having the same sex was the only scenario that didn\u2019t amass a majority of the public\u2019s support. If a gay king stands any chance of middle England embracing him he\u2019d need to be the \u201cright kind of gay\u201d. He\u2019d need a flawless, palatable narrative, starting with a well-managed coming-out arc and an inoffensive, \u201cstraight-acting\u201d partner who didn\u2019t challenge gender norms or stereotypes too much. I\u2019m sure this would probably still be a struggle for some. In Holdsworth\u2019s blogpost he assumes that influential gay public figures automatically inspire positive shifts in attitudes. He forgets that gay men can be just as terrible as their straight counterparts, and that their actions can often do the community \u2013 and the attitudes towards the community \u2013 more harm than good (see: Kevin Spacey, Milo Yiannopoulos, Perez Hilton). It\u2019s not enough any more for gay people in positions of power to just be visible. Simply existing as out gay political figures won\u2019t eradicate homophobia. A gay monarch\u2019s ability to engender positive change for LGBT people would stem from his actions, not his presence. Do they use their position as the head of the Commonwealth to lobby for decriminalisation in states where it\u2019s still illegal to be gay or do they continue the policy of skirting around the topic? Do they embrace sexuality and talk openly about it or are they just a monarch \u201cwho happens to be gay\u201d? Do they instigate progressive reform throughout the Church of England? The reaction to Holdsworth\u2019s suggestion from figures within the church once again emphasised how difficult instilling such change would be. Gavin Ashenden, a former chaplain to the Queen, told Christian Today that Holdsworth\u2019s comments were unkind, destructive and the \u201ctheological equivalent of the curse of the wicked fairy\u201d. Lee Gatiss, director of the Church Society, described the comments as sinister and claimed that \u201cto coopt the royal children to service a narrow sexual agenda seems particular tasteless\u201d. A destructive curse. A sinister, narrow sexual agenda. This is not the language of those about to see the light and embrace equality. At this stage, any energy spent trying to convert homophobic Christians is energy wasted. They\u2019re not interested in reform and they likely never will be. One positive aspect of the YouGov poll is that the majority of those under 49 found the idea of a same-sex royal wedding acceptable. The Church of England has been tearing itself apart over its obsession with gay rights for a while now, alienating young people in the process. The generational shift will ensure the debate around gay equality is one the bigots are destined to lose. If they want to drive themselves into irrelevancy in the meantime then so be it. Securing equality for trans people, ending austerity and homelessness and hate crimes \u2013 in the fight for LGBT liberation there are more pressing issues to worry about than the church\u2019s stance on same-sex marriage, issues that now lie largely outside the monarchy\u2019s influence. \u2022 Chris Godfrey is a Guardian journalist"
"6||Toys R Us confirms plans to shut at least 26 UK storesStruggling US retailer Toys R Us has confirmed plans to close to a third of its permanent UK stores but says all the branches will remain open through Christmas and the new year. Up to 800 jobs are threatened by the potential closure of at least 26 of Toys R Us\u2019s 84 permanent UK stores from spring next year. It is seeking to reduce the size of a further 26 stores along with rent reductions on those and 12 more stores. Steve Knights, the managing director of Toys R Us UK, said the company had to take \u201cstrong and decisive action\u201d as its largest warehouse-style stores opened in the 1980s and 1990s were \u201ctoo big and expensive to run in the current retail environment\u201d. On 21 December, Toys R Us will ask its creditors to approve a company voluntary agreement (CVA), an insolvency procedure used by retailers to close loss-making stores. The process, which will reduce its rental bill partly by closing stores, is being handled by Alvarez &amp; Marsal, a specialist adviser on corporate insolvencies. \u201cLike many UK retailers in today\u2019s market environment, we need to transform our business so that we have a platform that can better meet customers\u2019 evolving needs. The decision to propose this CVA was a difficult one, but we determined it is the best path forward to make essential changes to the business,\u201d Knights said. \u201cOur newer, smaller, more interactive stores are in the right shopping locations and are trading well, while our new website has generated significant growth in online and click-and-collect sales. But the warehouse-style stores we opened in the 1980s and 1990s, while successful in the early days, are too big and expensive to run in the current retail environment. The business has been loss-making in recent years and so we need to take strong and decisive action to accelerate the transformation.\u201d He said there would be no changes to the returns policies or gift cards across this period. The company\u2019s restructure comes during a tough run-up to Christmas for toy retailers; November sales are down 10%, according to one industry expert. Toys R Us is a subsidiary of the US chain, which filed for bankruptcy protection in September after running up $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) of debts. The UK business has been struggling for the same reasons as its parent, as shoppers shun the large out-of-town sheds that are synonymous with the Toys R Us brand, in favour of shopping online. Competition from supermarkets and the likes of Argos has ramped up. Toys R Us UK has been loss-making for seven out of the past eight years, with the most recent accounts filed at Companies House showing an operating loss of \u00a3500,000 on sales of \u00a3418m in the year to January. The accounts also show the write off of \u00a3584.5m in loans owed by a Toys R Us firm based in the British Virgin Islands as part of a group re-organisation. A subsidiary of the company, Toys R Us Holdings, shows a pension deficit of \u00a318.4m in January, up from \u00a310.25m a year before, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The company said it had an ongoing arrangement with the trustees of the pension fund to make additional contributions in respect of the deficit and the CVA would not change that arrangement. Frank Field MP, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, wrote on Monday to the pensions regulator and the chair of the company\u2019s pension fund trustees asking what impact the CVA and the write off of the BVI loans would have on pensioners. In October, it was reported that a number of suppliers had stopped delivering stock to Toys R Us in the UK because of problems with credit insurance. List of stores earmarked for closure Aberdeen, Basingstoke, Belfast Newtownabbey, Birmingham St. Andrews, Bolton, Bradford, Brislington (Bristol), Cambridge, Cardiff, Derry City, Doncaster, East Kilbride (South Lanarkshire), Exeter, Hayes (Middlesex), Kirkcaldy (Fife), Leicester, Livingston (West Lothian), Old Kent Road (south London), Plymouth, Scunthorpe, Shrewsbury, Tamworth (Staffordshire), Tunbridge Wells, Watford, York, and Manchester Central Retail Park \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."
"30||Public leaders network editorial board 2018: nominations openEvery year, we ask you, the members of our network, to help us in our search for leaders to shape what we do over the next 12 months. Nominations are now open for the 2018 Guardian Public Leaders editorial advisory board. Here at the network, we take an independent view of public leadership and policy, and in this, we have been very grateful for the valuable input by the members of our 2017 board: Michael Beaven, Niall Bolger, Dwayne Branch, Kate Carr, Aisling Duffy, Peter Fleming, Karen Holmes, Hayley Lewis, Steve McGuirk and Matt Stevenson-Dodd, all of whom have been a fantastic resource and have helped us see the Public Leaders Network achieve even wider audiences this year. A big thank you to them all. We\u2019re now looking for nine leaders to join our 2018 board. Once again, we want a board that reflects all those who deliver public services, including central government, local government and the private and voluntary sectors. Why become a member of the Public Leaders board? Guardian Public Leaders is unique in its breadth of public services coverage. When someone joins our board, they get a chance to come into the Guardian twice a year, to share their experience and catch up with leaders from other parts of public service. Former board members have found it stimulating, we hope \u2013 and of course it helps us ensure that we reflect the real mood of what\u2019s going on in public services. What\u2019s involved? We know public leaders are busier than ever. So we don\u2019t ask a huge commitment from our board. We ask our nine board members to attend two meetings a year, at the Guardian\u2019s offices in London, one in mid-February and the second in June. At each meeting, we ask every board member to give a brief overview of policy, management and leadership issues in their own sector. We then collectively, as a board, will consider what the key themes will be for the year. We also ask our board members to help us disseminate our content via their own social channels. They don\u2019t have to write anything for the network \u2013 but all contributions are welcome. Who is eligible? Nominees can work in any organisation and in any role, as long as they have a proven role in public services. The final board will be chosen from a shortlist decided by editor Jane Dudman, and will represent as far as possible a wide cross-section of those planning, designing and leading UK public services, including leaders from the private and voluntary sectors. How to nominate Before you nominate anyone, please check they are happy for you to do so, that they can attend two meetings of the board, and that all their contact details are up-to-date. You may not nominate yourself and you must be a member of the Public Leaders Network to take part in this election. Nominations are now open, and will close at midnight on Monday 8 January, 2018. Please provide full contact details for yourself, as a nominator, and for the leader you are nominating, including email, phone number, job title and organisation, plus a brief sentence on why you think your nominee should join our board. What happens next Once nominations have closed, the editor will draw up a shortlist and the final board members will then be agreed in consultation with members of this year\u2019s board. We will contact all successful nominees by Thursday 11 January 2017 and the new board will be published on the public leaders network. Any queries? Email public.leaders@theguardian.com or jane.dudman@theguardian.com if you have any queries. Nominate now If you\u2019re ready to nominate, you can now make your nomination here: Sign up for your free Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with comment and sector views sent direct to you every month.

"1||Serie A talking points: Benevento snatch wild first point and Inter charge to the topWith Napoli hosting Juventus on Friday night, we split the regular Serie A blog in two this week. The main piece, covering that game, is here. But the rest of the weekend turned out to be rather lively as well \u2026 Talking points \u2022 Unless you\u2019ve been under a rock, you\u2019ve probably heard by now about Benevento\u2019s draw with Milan, and more specifically about the manner in which the game ended. After losing the opening 14 games of their first-ever top-flight campaign, the Witches snatched a draw in the 95th minute with a header from their keeper, Alberto Brignoli. There are so many sub-plots with this one, but it is only right to start with the goalscorer himself. Brignoli is a man who professes to be a bit of a wimp about heading the ball in general, yet when Benevento won a free-kick just outside the area with time ticking down, he charged forwards despite being commanded by his manager, Roberto De Zerbi, not to. \u201cThe boss didn\u2019t want me to go up,\u201d acknowledged Brignoli afterwards. \u201cHe can be stubborn but I\u2019m even more so. I said: \u2018I\u2019m going. I\u2019m going, and that\u2019s that.\u2019 I leapt like a goalkeeper, not an attacker. They tell me that I looked like Aldo in the scene from [the movie] \u2018Tre uomini e una gamba\u2019 (Three men and one leg), and they are right. I was a bit crooked. I closed my eyes.\u201d Brignoli is only the fifth keeper to score in Serie A \u2013 joining Michelangelo Rampulla, Antonio Rigamonti, Lucidio Sentimenti and, most recently, Massimo Taibi. He wasn\u2019t even Benevento\u2019s starting keeper at the beginning of this season, taking over from Vid Belec in October. It was hard not to warm to him, though, as he paused during post-game interviews to express solidarity with the keeper he scored against: Gianluigi Donnarumma. A point might have been the least Benevento deserved for a game in which they had more shots than Milan and held the ball, on average, much higher up the pitch. As desperate as their league standing is, performances had been improving even before this. Four of their previous five games had been lost by a single goal \u2013 including the one away to Juventus \u2013 and there have been some especially cruel twists along the way. At Cagliari they grabbed a 93rd-minute equaliser only to concede again in the 94th. Benevento thought they had earned a draw with Sassuolo as Domenico Berardi\u2019s penalty hit the bar in injury-time. Instead, Federico Peluso headed home a winner for the Neroverdi moments later. So perhaps we should have seen this result coming. It was naive to imagine that there would be some immediate transformation for Milan under Rino Gattuso. The new manager has a modest coaching CV, and it will take more than his competitive fury to fix a team boasting plenty of talent but no clear tactical vision. As Gattuso himself observed afterwards: \u201cIt won\u2019t help, right now, for me to raise my voice and smash my fists on the table.\u201d This result, though, will leave a mark. \u201cIt would have been better to be stabbed than concede this goal,\u201d added Gattuso. \u201cThe lads in the changing room were desperate.\u201d \u2022 As Milan licked their wounds, the neighbours went top of the table. Juve\u2019s win at Napoli had created an opportunity for Inter, who seized it eagerly with a 5-0 demolition of Chievo. Their 39 points from 15 matches equals a club record set under Roberto Mancini back in 2006-07, when they cruised to the Scudetto. Back then, though, the field had been decimated by Calciopoli. It is hard to overstate what a fantastic job Luciano Spalletti is doing as manager, in a far more competitive field. And if any one player best represents the transformation of this team, it might be Ivan Perisic \u2013 who grabbed a hat-trick on Sunday. Next up comes the small matter of a trip to Turin to take on Juventus. The last time they met, back in February, Perisic was sent off in a 1-0 defeat. \u2022 Roma rolled over Spal on Saturday, but Lazio kept hold of their coattails in the race for Champions League places, with a come-from-behind win away to Sampdoria. Not for the first time this season, it was Sergej Milinkovic-Savic who made the difference, scoring his team\u2019s 80th-minute equaliser before setting up Felipe Caicedo\u2019s winner with a clever reverse pass into the box (even if it did take a bit of a scramble from there before the Ecuadorian could bundle it home). \u2022 Not a happy return to Serie A for Beppe Iachini, whose first league game since replacing Cristian Bucchi as manager of Sassuolo ended in a 3-0 defeat at Fiorentina. But more encouraging signs for this young Viola team, for whom Giovanni Simeone (22 years old), Jordan Veretout (24) and Federico Chiesa (20) grabbed the goals. Results: Roma 3-1 Spal, Napoli 0-1 Juventus, Torino 1-1 Atalanta, Benevento 2-2 Milan, Bologna 1-1 Cagliari, Fiorentina 3-0 Sassuolo, Inter 5-0 Chievo, Sampdoria 1-2 Lazio. Monday: Crotone v Udinese, Verona v Genoa."
"29||Death from air pollution would be cut if UK hits walking and cycling targetsIf the UK hits government targets for walking and cycling more than 13,000 lives and almost \u00a310bn would be saved over the next decade, according to a new report. The study from the transport charity Sustrans has found that meeting government plans in England and Scotland for an increase in walking or cycling would reduce deaths from air pollution by more than 13,000 in the next 10 years. It would also save almost \u00a39.31bn. Xavier Brice, CEO for Sustrans, said that at a time when road transport is \u201cresponsible for the majority of air quality limit breaches in the UK\u201d it has never been more important to reduce the number of \u201cmotorised vehicles on our roads\u201d. \u201cThe new findings reiterate that walking and cycling have a huge role to play in tackling the air quality crisis that causes tens of thousands of premature deaths every year. If we are to make a major modal shift, we need to provide a network of direct protected cycle routes on roads in addition to quieter routes across the UK.\u201d Air pollution contributes to around 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK. The government is being taken to court for a third time over the levels of toxic air in cities across the UK caused by nitrogen dioxide, mainly from diesel vehicles. Many towns and cities are now also failing WHO guidelines for the most damaging type of air pollution known as PM2.5, 45% of which comes from car tyre and brake wear and would not be reduced by a move to electric vehicles. A report last month revealed that every area in London exceeds World Health Organisation limits for PM2.5. Brice said: \u201cWe are urging governments at all levels to include funding for walking and cycling infrastructure in their clean air plans and the UK government to prioritise investment in active travel as part of wider urgent action to make air safe again.\u201d Sustrans, in partnership with the environmental consultancy Eunomia, found that if targets to double journeys by bike and increase walking by \u201c300 stages per person\u201d in the England\u2019s Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy were met, this would prevent more than 8,300 premature deaths from air pollution. This would result in \u00a35.67bn in benefits over 10 years through the avoided costs associated with poor air quality, including NHS treatment in hospital for respiratory diseases. Equally, if the aim of 10% of everyday journeys to be taken by bike set out in Scotland\u2019s Cycling Action Plan was realised, it would save nearly 4,000 premature deaths and \u00a33.64bn. Sustran said the gains would be even bigger if wider benefits to health and wellbeing from increased physical activity were included. Twenty-nine local authorities in England that are breaking legal air quality limits now have to pull together clean air plans by November next year. Ann Ballinger, an air quality expert at Eunomia, said: \u201cThis is the first time that Sustrans\u2019s data has been used alongside public health data to understand what impacts walking and cycling schemes have on an individual\u2019s exposure to air pollution. \u201cOur analysis suggests investment in cycling and walking has considerable potential to improve local air pollution. We believe this innovative model could be of considerable value in supporting local authorities and government as these bodies consider options to tackle the air pollution emergency at a local level.\u201d"
"16||Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?Welcome to this week\u2019s roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Let\u2019s start with some old favourites. The wonderful Love and War in the Apennines by Eric Newby has charmed greenmill: The kindness shown to him, a PoW on the run, by peasant families in the mountains of central Italy who were putting themselves at grave risk by sheltering him, is extraordinary and life-affirming. Newby\u2019s early stuff, from The Last Grain Race to A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush, is uniformly wonderful. Meanwhile, just john has been out in space with Iain M Banks and Matter: I\u2019m back to rereading Iain M Banks, this time with Matter. It\u2019s a heroic fantasy about a refugee prince and his trusty-but-unimpressed servant fleeing the murderers of his father the king, all layered \u2013 both narratively and physically \u2013 within the space opera of Banks\u2019 Culture series. I just had to tell somebody how much I\u2019m enjoying this, and so now I have. I\u2019m very glad to have been told. I also enjoyed hearing FreethoughtRules extolling the virtues of Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein: What a wonderful book! Totally different to what I expected. Such beautiful language! It sounds like paulburns had a less enjoyable, but still worthwhile experience with Joseph Roth\u2019s The Radetsky March: I should preface my comments by saying I\u2019ve been looking forward to reading this book ever since I first read about it on Tips, links and suggestions. Its exquisitely written. Tracing three generations of the Trotta family, it follows the closing years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire up to the first world war, through the military and bureaucratic fortunes of fathers and sons, not whole families. I was most impressed by the chapters on Emperor Franz-Josef I, and life on the Austro-Hungarian Russian border. I had to struggle with this book for some reason, force myself through it to the end. It had a sense of nasty oppression about it, but maybe that\u2019s just me. Finally, two books about the silver screen. The Friedkin Connection: A Memoir by William Friedkin has been entertaining writeronthestorm: It\u2019s brilliant \u2013 it concentrates on his films, rather than his private life, but is very interesting on how he managed to pull those films together and he seems very forthright and honest. And judgeDAmNationAgain recommends James Stewart: a Biography by Marc Eliot: Makes for particularly pertinent reading at the moment, as it details the predatory behaviour of certain directors; not to mention the particularly odious-sounding Louis B Mayer, who kept a brothel on the studio lot (populated by various aspiring actresses, dwindling stars and \u201cstarlets\u201d) which a young Jimmy was obliged to \u201cpatronise\u201d in order to keep up a certain image. The book itself is very readable and comprehensive, and gives enough detail about his various films without slipping into Film Studies 101 \u2013 it is interesting how throughout much of Stewart\u2019s career he just seems to be almost making it into the big time and quickly bombing again soon afterwards whenever a big success does come his way; and how such classics as It\u2019s a Wonderful Life and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance aren\u2019t considered \u201csuccessful\u201d films until many years later, with the former only becoming a major hit when it starts being shown on television at Christmas 20 years later. I had no idea it took so long. Ironically enough, like many others, I first saw It\u2019s a Wonderful Life at a special Christmas cinema screening. An experience I\u2019d recommend to anyone. Interesting links about books and reading A reminder of the greatness of William Blake. Is there hope for independent book shops? AN Wilson is fascinating about the great Anthony Powell. Jonathan Lethem once caught a Beat. If you would like to share a photo of the book you are reading, or film your own book review, please do.

"24||'Would you be willing?': words to turn a conversation around (and those to avoid)It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s how you say it \u2013 isn\u2019t it? According to language analysts, we may have this wrong. \u2018\u2018We are pushed and pulled around by language far more than we realise,\u201d says Elizabeth Stokoe, professor of social interaction at Loughborough University. Stokoe and her colleagues have analysed thousands of hours of recorded conversations, from customer services to mediation hotlines and police crisis negotiation. They discovered that certain words or phrases have the power to change the course of a conversation. Some of these words are surprising, and go against what we\u2019ve been taught to believe. (For example, in a study of conversations between doctors and patients, evidence showed that doctors who listed \u201coptions\u201d rather than recommended \u201cbest-interest\u201d solutions, got a better response, despite the suggestion from hospital guidelines to talk about the best interests of the patient.) But, from conversation analysts such as Stokoe to FBI negotiators and communication coaches, we\u2019re learning which words are likely to placate or persuade us. Here are some of the biggest dos and don\u2019ts. Do use: willing One of the first words Stokoe came across that seemed to have a magical effect on people was \u201cwilling\u201d. \u201cIt started with looking at mediation telephone calls,\u201d she explains \u2013 that is, calls to or from a mediation centre, where the aim was to persuade people to engage with mediation to resolve their conflicts. \u201cWhen they\u2019re in a dispute, people usually want a lawyer or the police. They don\u2019t really want mediation, so they\u2019re quite resistant.\u201d Stokoe found that people who had already responded negatively when asked if they would like to attend mediation seemed to change their minds when the mediator used the phrase, \u201cWould you be willing to come for a meeting?\u201d \u201cAs soon as the word \u2018willing\u2019 was uttered, people would say: \u2018Oh, yes, definitely\u2019 \u2013 they would actually interrupt the sentence to agree.\u201d Stokoe found it had the same effect in different settings: with business-to-business cold callers; with doctors trying to persuade people to go to a weight-loss class. She also looked at phrases such as \u201cWould you like to\u201d and \u201cWould you be interested in\u201d. \u201cSometimes they worked, but \u2018willing\u2019 was the one that got people to agree more rapidly and with more enthusiasm.\u201d What to say Deploy it when you\u2019ve already been met with some resistance: \u201cI know it\u2019s not your first choice, but would you be willing to meet on Friday?\u201d Don\u2019t use: just In 2015, Ellen Leanse, a former Google executive, wrote a LinkedIn blog about the way men and women use the word \u201cjust\u201d\u2019. In the blog, which went viral, she claimed that women use it far more often than men. \u201cIt hit me that there was something about the word I didn\u2019t like. It was a \u2018permission\u2019 word \u2013 a warm-up to a request, an apology for interrupting, a shy knock on the door before asking: \u2018Can I get something I need from you?\u2019\u201d Leanse asked her co-workers to have a moratorium on the word \u201cjust\u201d, banning it from their communication. She claimed the difference in how confident people felt was noticeable after a few weeks. Her evidence wasn\u2019t scientific, but, even so, \u201cjust\u201d is one of those words that has a habit of creeping into our emails and spoken conversations. Fine if you\u2019re trying to be placatory, but if you want to have more authority, lose the \u201cjust\u201d. What to say Try your own experiment over the next week. Read your emails back before you send them and count the number of times that \u201cI just wanted to\u201d or \u201cCould I just\u201d appear. Edit them out and see the difference in tone. Do use: speak (instead of talk) The word \u201ctalk\u201d seems to make a lot of people resistant to conversation. \u201cWe observed this when looking at interactions between police negotiators and suicidal persons in crisis,\u201d Stokoe says. Negotiators who used phrases such as, \u201cI\u2019m here to talk\u201d met with more resistance. \u201cPersons in crisis would often respond with something like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk, what\u2019s the point in talking?\u2019\u201d When the verb was \u201cspeak\u201d, however, persons in crisis were more likely to open up the conversation or offer new information. Why the difference? Stokoe suspects it\u2019s because the cultural idioms associated with \u201ctalk\u201d cast a negative shadow. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re all talk; talk is cheap; you talk the talk, but don\u2019t walk the walk\u2019: we seem to think that people who want to talk don\u2019t place much value on what we\u2019re saying.\u201d There was a similar difference in the effectiveness of the word \u201csort\u201d, as opposed to \u201chelp\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s sort it\u201d feels much more direct and active. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying to fake a softly-softly relationship with someone in crisis. Better to be practical and direct.\u201d What to say If you really want someone to engage with you, use, \u201cCan I speak to you about this?\u201d, rather than \u201cCan we talk?\u201d Don\u2019t use: How are you? Stokoe uses her research to work with groups on improving their communication, including groups of business-to-business cold callers. \u201cOne of the main messages of that work was to tell people to stop building rapport,\u201d she says. \u201cSales people are trained to do small talk at the beginning of calls, but we were able to show with our research that it doesn\u2019t work. \u201cNot only is there no evidence of reciprocal rapport-building, but also you\u2019re more likely to irritate the other person and extend the length of that call.\u201d It\u2019s not so much that the \u201cHow are you?\u201d is rude, but rather that it\u2019s false. In real life, no one asks \u201cHow are you today?\u201d in that cold-call way, if they know the person and genuinely want an answer to the question. We would rather they got to the point. What to say The next time you have to speak to someone you don\u2019t know, don\u2019t be overly friendly. Stick to being polite. Do use: some (instead of any) \u201cAnything else I can do for you?\u201d Sounds like a perfectly reasonable question, doesn\u2019t it? But John Heritage and Jeffrey Robinson, conversation analysts at the University of California, Los Angeles, looked at how doctors use the words \u201cany\u201d and \u201csome\u201d in their final interactions with patients. They found that \u201cIs there something else I can do for you today?\u201d elicited a better response than \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d \u201cAny\u201d tends to meet with negative responses. Think about meetings you\u2019ve been in \u2013 what\u2019s the usual response to \u201cAny questions?\u201d A barrage of engaging ideas or awkward silence? It\u2019s too open-ended; too many possibilities abound. Of course, if you don\u2019t want people to ask you anything, then stick to \u201cAny questions?\u201d What to say Try not to use \u201cany\u201d if you genuinely want feedback or to open up debate. \u201cWhat do you think about X?\u201d might be a more specific way of encouraging someone to talk. Don\u2019t use: Yes, but If you\u2019re stuck in a circular argument and you\u2019re convinced that you\u2019re the reasonable one, try listening out for how often you both use the phrase \u201cYes, but\u201d. \u201cWe all know the phrase \u2018Yes, but\u2019 really means \u2018No, and here\u2019s why you\u2019re wrong\u2019,\u201d says Rob Kendall, author of Workstorming. A conversation expert, Kendall sits in on other people\u2019s meetings as an observer. The phrase \u201cYes, but\u201d is one of the classic warning signs that you\u2019re in an unwinnable conversation, he says. \u201cIf you hear it three or more times in one discussion, it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re going nowhere.\u201d What to say Kendall advises shifting the conversation by asking the other person \u201cWhat\u2019s needed here?\u201d or, even better, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d \u201cIt takes you from what I call \u2018blamestorming\u2019 to a solution-focused outcome.\u201d Do use: It seems like Rapport-building may be of little value in cold calls, but it can be essential if you\u2019re trying to bring someone round to your point of view or end a conflict. As former FBI negotiator Chris Voss writes in Never Split The Difference, his manual of persuasive techniques, there are five stages in what\u2019s known as the \u201cbehavioural change stairway model\u201d that take anyone from \u201clistening to influencing behaviour\u201d. The first stage is active listening \u2013 namely, being able to show the other person that you have taken in what they\u2019ve said and, more importantly, have a sense of what it means to them. Rather than focusing on what you want to say, listen to what the other person is telling you, then try to repeat it back to them. Start with, \u201cIt seems like what you\u2019re saying is\u201d or \u201cCan I just check, it sounds like what you\u2019re saying is\u201d. If that feels too contrived, it often works simply to repeat the last sentence or thought someone has expressed (known in counselling practice as \u201creflecting\u201d). What to say Try, \u201cIt seems like you\u2019re feeling frustrated with this situation \u2013 is that right?\u201d Always give the other person the opportunity to comment on or correct your assessment. Do use: Hello \u201c\u2018Hello\u2019 is a really important word that can change the course of a conversation,\u201d Stokoe says. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you respond to people who are what we call \u2018first movers\u2019 \u2013 people who say something really critical, apropos of nothing.\u201d It might be the work colleague who steams up to your desk with a complaint or the neighbour who launches into a rant about parking as you\u2019re putting out the bins. \u201cWhat do you do with that person? Rather than respond in the same manner, saying something nice, such as a very bright \u2018Hello!\u2019, derails and socialises that other person a little bit.\u201d What to say Use it when you want to resist getting into a confrontation. \u201cYou have to be careful not to sound too passive-aggressive,\u201d Stokoe says, \u201cbut just one friendly word in a bright tone can delete the challenge of the conversation.\u201d \u2022 Commenting on this piece?

"31||Yule logs and trifles: Jeremy Lee\u2019s 12 puddings of Christmas part 410 B\u00fbche de No\u00ebl yule log (main picture) This really is better made at home. And it\u2019s useful to have a sugar thermometer when making it. Serves 14-16 For the chocolate icing 300g dark chocolate (70% cocoa) 120g unsalted butter 150ml double cream For the roulade 400g dark chocolate (70% cocoa) 480ml double cream Half a vanilla pod, seeds scraped \u00bc tsp ground cinnamon 9 egg whites 2 tbsp caster sugar For the filling 200g dark chocolate (70% cocoa) 5 tbsp water 6 egg yolks 3 tbsp caster sugar 325g unsalted butter, softened Jersey or whipped cream, to serve 1 To make the icing, bring a small pan of water to the boil. Put the chocolate and butter together in a bowl and put it over the pan making sure it doesn\u2019t touch the water. Reduce to a simmer, and let the chocolate and butter melt, whisking often. Remove from the heat. Whisk in the double cream and cover with clingfilm. Stab the film a few times with a knife to let out any residual warmth. Leave to one side. 2 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and line a large oven tray with baking parchment. 3 To make the roulade, break the chocolate into a large bowl. Heat the cream in a heavy-bottomed pan until hot, and stir in the vanilla seeds and the cinnamon. Pour the cream on to the chocolate and whisk until smooth. Set aside to cool. 4 Put the egg whites in a bowl, add the caster sugar and beat until peaked. Add the egg whites to the chocolate in three stages, each time mixing well. Tip the batter on to the baking parchment and spread it out. Bake for 10 minutes or so until a knife inserted comes out clean. 5 For the filling, put a pan of water on to boil. Put the chocolate and 2 tbsp water into a bowl, set it over the pan making sure it doesn\u2019t touch the water. Lower the heat to a simmer. Stir until the chocolate has melted. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. 6 Put the sugar and 3 tbsp water into a pan over a medium heat. Swirl the pan allowing the sugar to dissolve. Let it boil for 4-5 minutes until just before becoming caramel \u2013 or when it reaches 236C/455F, if using a sugar thermometer. Remove from the heat. 7 Whisk the egg yolks on a low speed, gently adding the syrup until the mixture cools. Add a slice of butter at a time, beating thoroughly all the while. Carry on beating until thickened and smooth. Stir in the cooled chocolate and put to one side. 8 To assemble, carefully lift the cake with the baking parchment to a flat surface. Spread the filling evenly over the cake. Using the paper, roll the cake, pulling away the paper as you go until the roll is complete and the paper can be lifted away entirely. Lift the cake with great care on to a serving plate. Don\u2019t worry about cracks. 9 Apply the icing in uneven markings evoking bark \u2026 rough and ready. If you\u2019re inclined, add a little tree and a little festive figurine on top. 11 A winter\u2019s poached fruit salad The resulting syrup from this salad is good chilled and added to champagne for a rather cavalier version of a pousse rapi\u00e8re. It is worth making a day or two in advance to allow all the flavours to mingle. Serves 6 1 lemon 6 pears 200ml white wine 200g caster sugar 1 vanilla pod 2 bay leaves 10 black peppercorns A blade of mace 12 plump agen prunes, stones in 12 dried apricots, unsulphurised 12 dried figs Jersey cream or Greek yoghurt, to serve 1 Peel strips off the lemon as for a martini, then squeeze the juice into a bowl. Peel the pears and toss them in the lemon juice. 2 Put 30ml water and the wine, sugar, vanilla pod, bay, peppercorns and mace into a pan. Bring to a boil on a high heat. Add the pears, lemon juice and peel. 3 Cut a disc of baking parchment to fit the pot and lay on the surface to ensure the pears are submerged. A plate on top might help. Lower the heat to a simmer and poach the pears gently until quite cooked through. The time will depend on the ripeness of the pears and may take 30-50 minutes. The pears are done when a knife inserted is given no resistance from the pears. 4 Add the prunes, apricots and figs, bring back to the boil for 30 seconds then remove the pan from the heat and let the fruit steep while it cools. 5 Once cooled, gently remove the poached fruits to a serving bowl and pour over the syrup unstrained. 6 Store in a cool place until ready to serve with cream or Greek yoghurt. 12 Chocolate trifle In homage to Antonio Carluccio, the author of this impressive pick-me-up. Serves 12-15 For the cake 90g dark chocolate (70% cocoa) 2 tbsp espresso coffee 60g unsalted butter, softened 3 eggs, separated 50g plus 1 tbsp caster sugar A pinch of salt 50g plain flour, sifted For the cream 2 eggs, separated 50g plus 1 tsp caster sugar 400g mascarpone 80ml double cream To assemble 400ml espresso coffee 4 tbsp cognac Bitter cocoa powder 125g dark chocolate (70% cocoa) 1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 23cm cake tin with baking parchment. 2 Set a pan of water to boil. Break the chocolate into a bowl and add the coffee. Sit the bowl on the pan, making sure it doesn\u2019t touch the water. Lower to a simmer and melt the chocolate. Remove from the heat. Beat in the butter a little at a time until smooth. 3 Put the egg yolks in a bowl with the 50g sugar and beat until pale and fluffy. 4 Put the egg whites in another bowl, add a pinch of salt and beat until peaked. Add the 1 tbsp sugar and return the whites to a peak. 5 Mix together the egg yolk and the chocolate mixtures. Spoon a third of the egg whites into the chocolate and mix lightly but well. Fold in another third of the egg white, add half the flour and mix. Add the remaining egg white and flour and mix thoroughly. 6 Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin and bake for about 30 minutes. Cool on a rack. 7 Meanwhile, make the cream. Beat the egg yolks and the 50g sugar in a bowl until pale and fluffy. Add the mascarpone a spoon at a time until smooth. Stir in the cream. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until peaked, add the 1 tsp of sugar, then fold this into the cream. 8 To assemble, cover the bottom of a trifle bowl with slices of the chocolate cake. Spoon over the coffee then the cognac. Dust with a little sifted cocoa powder. Strew with the broken chocolate. Tip in the cream and smooth the surface. Dust with more cocoa. Cover and refrigerate overnight. When serving, the trifle may need an extra flourish of freshly sifted cocoa. Jeremy Lee is the chef-proprietor of Quo Vadis restaurant in London; @jeremyleeqv"
"32||Pensioner poverty and food waste: your best comments on the Guardian todayA sharp rise in child and pensioner poverty, retailers getting the best out of food\u2019s shelf life to reduce waste and film of the year nominations have got you talking today. To join in you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts. We\u2019ll continue to highlight more comments worth reading as the day goes on. UK government warned over sharp rise in child and pensioner poverty Research by thinktank the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has found almost 400,000 more children and 300,000 more pensioners were living in poverty in the UK last year compared with 2012-13. Among its recommendations it has urged the government to unfreeze benefits. \u2018Austerity and these savage cuts on the poor and vulnerable were not needed\u2019 The worst aspect of this is that austerity and these savage cuts on the poor and vulnerable were not needed, it was a pure ideologically driven political decision whose purpose was to destroy the welfare state. George Osborne and David Cameron mislead the people, Miliband was taken up defending himself against Blair and Mandelson and these two villains and their accomplices the Orange Book neoliberal Liberals attacked the remains of what used to make Britain a decent place to live. Silvertown \u2018The Tories have tried to deliberately create an alternate history\u2019 The Tories have tried to deliberately create an alternate history in this country for their own narrow, selfish, economic and political ends. Unfortunately, since they now effectively control most of the British media through their allies, a lot of the younger generation have been effectively brainwashed in to believing that everything has always been like this and nothing can ever change. I was heartened to see in the 2017 General Election that young people are now actively participating in elections and are beginning to reject \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d. Peter Retailer to sell food past its \u2018best before\u2019 date in bid to cut waste In an effort to reduce waste the East of England Co-op is to sell tinned goods and dried food such as pasta, crisps and rice for a nominal 10p once they reach their best-before date. \u2018My task was to transfer perfectly good food into a skip\u2019 When I worked in a major supermarket I was put on \u2018waste-duty\u2019, my task was to transfer perfectly good food into a skip. After that day I used to get the price gun, set it to 10p and stand next too the food at 7pm every day (I would get an influx of customers looking for my deals, which mostly consisted of shrivelled or slightly mouldy Gourds which would be thrown out at the end of my shift, I rarely didn\u2019t manage too shift it all, customers would go around the shop and find the most \u2018past it food\u2019 on the shelf, hand it to me and I\u2019d judge it and slap a 10p sticker on it. I got disciplined for doing so, I was taken off the shop floor and put into the warehouse where I resumed putting perfectly good food into a skip \u2013 and quit the next day. Calbum The Braddies 2017: Peter Bradshaw nominates his films of the year Readers have been responding to Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw\u2019s films of the year nominations. \u2018The blackest humour I have ever seen on screen\u2019 I haven\u2019t seen all those films nominated for Best Film, but of the films I have seen...

Waunarlwydd \u2018How can you nominate a picture for best film but not then best director?\u2019 How can you nominate Blade Runner for best film but not then best director? It happens at the Oscars too, but with this film in particular, it is very much the work of an emerging auteur and if Bradshaw is going to recognise the merits of film, it would seem impossible to discount the direction. danielplainview \u2018Would you be willing?\u2019: words to turn a conversation around (and those to avoid) This piece on useful turns of phrase to turn a conversation in your favour has provoked much discussion.

"21||Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs to open Berlin film festivalWes Anderson\u2019s stop-motion animation film Isle of Dogs is to receive its world premiere at the Berlin film festival on 15 February 2018, it has been announced. Set in a dystopian future Japan in which all dogs have been exiled to a quarantine island after a mysterious \u201ccanine flu\u201d, Isle of Dogs follows the lead character, a 12-year-old called Atari as he searches for his dog, Spots. Isle of Dog\u2019s English-language voice cast includes Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton and Tilda Swinton. The film found itself embroiled in a \u201cwhitewashing\u201d controversy when its trailer was released, over its casting of primarily white American actors in a Japanese setting. However, it has since been revealed that Canadian-Japanese actor Koyu Rankin will voice the key role of Atari. Anderson\u2019s previous film The Grand Budapest Hotel also secured the opening gala spot at the Berlin film festival in 2014, and though early in the year gained considerable momentum during awards season. It gained the most Oscar nominations, 10, for the 2015 ceremony, but won only four, for best makeup, production design, costume design and score. Isle of Dogs is due for release on 23 March in the US, 29 March in Australia, and 30 March in the UK."
"22||Hearts and minds: Giles Fraser on life after his quadruple bypassVassilios Avlonitis sits in a cramped basement office in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. He may be a distinguished cardiac surgeon, but in the cash-strapped NHS, he still has to share a tiny workspace. He is immaculately turned out, with a kind face and the sort of hands I imagine playing the piano. And it\u2019s his hands that I can\u2019t stop looking at. The same hands that picked up a radial saw and cut through my breastbone. The same hands \u2013 the only hands \u2013 that have literally touched my heart. The hands that stripped veins from my leg and used them to replumb my broken heart. I have this man to thank for saving my life. And the cash-strapped NHS, of course. It is 50 years since Christiaan Barnard performed the first successful heart transplant operation. At the time, it was akin to putting a man on the moon. My operation was just a simple quadruple heart bypass, not a transplant. The day after the terrorist attack at Borough market, I had a heart attack. The team at St Thomas\u2019 discovered that my heart was almost completely blocked up with gunk. And they fixed me. So now I am overly aware of all things heart-shaped \u2013 both the pointy red heart shape that gets tattooed on arms and printed on Valentine\u2019s cards and the fist-sized muscly pump that propels blood around our bodies. That there are two very different hearts is interesting. One is the heart of medical science. The other is the heart of countless poems and religious writings, the heart that is a symbol of our emotional life, indeed, for some, a symbol of our very existence. Barnard\u2019s pioneering operation was an important stage in their long and complicated divorce because prior to this first heart transplant operation, it was the beating of our hearts that was widely regarded as signifying our being alive. Death was the cessation of the heartbeat because the heart was seen as the fountain of life. That is why the Japanese transplant surgeon Juro Wada, who performed a heart transplant in 1968, was charged with the intentional homicide of the donor. The logic was clear: if the heart was still OK, then the donor must still have been alive when the heart was removed. In this country, the Daily Express led a campaign against heart transplants, stoking up fear that organs were being harvested from those who could have been saved. The questions kept on coming. If the heart was indeed the source of life, what did that mean for the identity of the recipient? And in apartheid South Africa, this anxiety was given a racial dimension \u2013 particularly after Barnard\u2019s second operation, in which a mixed-race man\u2019s heart was used to save a white man. The Guardian commented, with bitter sarcasm: \u201cThere is no provision under the Group Areas Act for black hearts to beat in white areas.\u201d It was partly in response to some of these issues that we now we think of death as the shutting down of a part of our brain, with brain death becoming the accepted medical definition of death from the 70s onwards. Nevertheless, it was still extremely disconcerting to hear Mr Avlonitis tell me that, as a part of the operation, he had stopped my heart beating for the best part of an hour. Medical science may have shifted our existential centre of gravity from the heart to the brain, but for an old sentimentalist such as myself, the heart will always feel like the centre of my being. It was a conversation with Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, that helped me understand why I still think that. Imagine how peculiar it would be if scientific advance created an artificial replacement pump for the heart that pushes blood around the body in one continuous flow, without a beat. This thought got us talking about Shakespeare and his use of iambic pentameter. \u201cBut, soft! What light through yon-der win-dow breaks?\u201d The rhythm \u2013 ber-bum, ber-bum, ber-bum, ber-bum, ber-bum \u2013 is the rhythm of our heartbeat. That is what makes Shakespeare\u2019s poetry so ingressive, so affecting. It picks up on the earliest noise we hear, in the womb. And this rhythm accompanies us throughout our lives. Rowan compared it to the tide coming in and out. It is a sort of anchor, a fixed and continuous reference on which we come to attach a sense of self. This is the beat that monks and mystics have listened out for in their periods of silent prayer, as if listening to this is to spend time deliberately conscious of the constituent conditions of being human. There would be something profoundly disorientating in having an artificial heart that didn\u2019t need to beat out this constant and uninterrupted tempo. We have strayed a long way from the calm and collected Mr Avlonitis, who smiled weakly at my tendency towards exotic metaphysical speculations. He is a scientist. And his subject is a pump. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that make him just a glorified plumber?\u201d I tried to provoke him, for conversation\u2019s sake. \u201cHasn\u2019t the brain taken centre-stage now?\u201d And with that my mind was off, thinking about how interesting it was that we have become a far more rationally oriented culture at around the same time that the brain has become the preeminent organ in the human body. But he was not provokable. No doubt it is the quality of imperturbability that makes him such an effective surgeon. If he was a plumber, he was a plumber that has saved my life. Not just that, but I feel better today than I have for a great many years. I would say that I am born again. And I thank him, and all the staff at St Thomas\u2019, from the bottom of my heart. Radio 4 will be marking 50 years since the first heart transplant with a range of programmes this week with Giles Fraser\u2019s series This Old Heart of Mine, Monday to Friday at 1.45pm.

"24||Echo chambers are dangerous \u2013\u00a0 we must try to break free of our online bubblesIt has been little over a year since Donald Trump stunned the world by becoming US president. His election marked a severe upset to conventional wisdom, with his startling use of social media drawing particular attention. A new nadir came last week, with Trump sharing videos from far-right group Britain First via Twitter. These were also shared by conservative Ann Coulter, one of only 45 people the president follows on Twitter.When asked by the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson to explain why the president might have retweeted videos from a far-right group, Coulter responded that Trump could not be expected to check the biography of people he retweeted and that \u201cthe video is the video, it\u2019s not a faked video\u201d. This ugly incident perfectly illustrates a deeper problem: the alarming ease with whichsocial media and the internet as a whole can be abused, and used to prop up dubious narratives. This abuse is an ubiquitous problem, but perhaps one that might have surprised the pioneers of the web. The early days of the internet promised a mind-expanding utopia, where we could freely exchange new ideas and contemplate other points of view. Even in those days of heady optimism, there were already a few academics who worried that this vision pivoted on too high-minded a picture of human nature. In 2017, after a year of revelations involving cyberbullying, troll factories, campaigns of misinformation and more, we should urgently be questioning our use of online space. And to counter these threats we need to examine the greatest one: our own cosy online bubble. In 1996, MIT researchers Marshall Van Alstyne and Erik Brynjolfsson warned of a potential dark side to our newly interconnected world: Individuals empowered to screen out material that does not conform to their existing preferences may form virtual cliques, insulate themselves from opposing points of view, and reinforce their biases. Internet users can seek out interactions with like-minded individuals who have similar values, and thus become less likely to trust important decisions to people whose values differ from their own.\u201d Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson dubbed this fracturing of the online community Cyberbalkanization. Ominously, they warned that \u201cthe loss of shared experiences and values may be harmful to the structure of democratic societies as well as decentralized organizations.\u201d Their foresight appears to have been uncomfortably close to the mark. An analysis of the 2016 US presidential election by the Columbia Journalism Review noted that \u201c\u2026 a right-wing media network anchored around Breitbart developed as a distinct and insulated media system, using social media as a backbone to transmit a hyper-partisan perspective to the world.\u201d The consequence? \u201cThis pro-Trump media sphere appears to have not only successfully set the agenda for the conservative media sphere, but also strongly influenced the broader media agenda, in particular coverage of Hillary Clinton.\u201d Of course, some degree of ideological bias is inescapable, and can hardly be blamed solely on the internet. Newspapers, for example, have always catered to their audience. Nowhere is this clearer than in the UK, which has arguably the most partisan press in the world. But, despite whatever editorial leanings publications may have, a robust legal and \u2013 in some cases regulatory \u2013 framework places media outlets under compulsion to at least report facts when it comes to news. Whatever the faults of the mainstream media, they do not have carte blanche to concoct fictions, libel or slander. But what the internet has done is facilitate the emergence of alternative news sites. And here, factual accuracy can no longer be taken for granted. Untethered from journalistic ethics, some outlets thrive by telling their audience precisely what they want to hear. And social media allows the rapid growth and spread of everything from the ludicrous Pizzagate conspiracy theory to rampant climate-change denial \u2013 and exists across the political spectrum. This proliferation of urban myths and conspiracies would perhaps be laughable if it weren\u2019t so uniquely dangerous. An estimated 61% of millennials garner news primarily through social media. But in the process, we trigger algorithms that curate our feeds. These cherry-pick things with which we are likely to agree and jettison information that does not appear to fit our preferences \u2013 often at the cost of accuracy and balance. As the Knight Center observed in 2016, \u201c\u2026 through social media, professional and other qualified news is mixed with un-checked information and opinions. Rumours and gossip get in the flow.\u201d They also noted this tended to increase political polarisation, and warned: \u201cpeople may be losing the skills to differentiate information from opinion.\u201d So why does this happen? Part of the problem is our reliance on internet giants \u2013 and their vested interest in rewarding us with what we like to see. Everything from our Google searches to our Facebook news feeds are tailored to keep us engaged and generate profit. But while there is limited evidence that filter bubbles might reduce diversity, the data suggests that we play the lead role in driving our own polarisation. We are much more homogeneous than we think, and tend to interact more with people who echo our beliefs. A recent study in Science found that we tend to engage most with information that flatters our ideological preconceptions, and that this accounted for much more selection bias than algorithmic filtering. Such findings probably won\u2019t be overly surprising to psychologists, who have long been aware of the human tendency towards confirmation bias. But such polarisation has consequences far beyond politics \u2013 it has alarming implications for science, and our collective wellbeing. For example, , climate-change denial is strongly linked to political belief. Yet despite the overwhelming evidence of anthropogenic climate change, the proliferation of outlets publishing claims attempting to counter the scientific consensus means those unwilling to face reality have no shortage of media sources to bolster theirview \u2013 to our collective detriment. These divisions run deep, creating walled communities that reinforce their own beliefs in a feedback loop. A 2015 study in PNAS found that misinformation flourished online, because users \u201c\u2026 aggregate in communities of interest, which causes reinforcement and fosters confirmation bias, segregation, and polarisation\u201d. These online echo chambers cement dubious notions, giving them an air of legitimacy and fuel increasing separation from reality. Targeted individuals (TIS), for example, believe their every action is being shadowed by some sinister collective, convening online to discuss it. Many claim to hear sinister voices in their head, suggesting delusional disorders might be at play, a view supported by research to date. Yet on forums for those affected, the strongly-enforced message that those suggesting a psychological cause are agents of deception. As psychologist Dr Lorraine Sheridan laments, \u201cthere are no counter sites that try and convince targeted individuals that they are delusional. They end up in a closed-ideology echo chamber.\u201d With victims discouraged from getting help, tragic consequences can ensue. In 2014, Myron May uploaded a video to YouTube outlining his agony as a TI, hours before opening fire at Florida state University, dying in a shoot-out with police. Echo chambers abound for many other conditions which are not medically recognised, from chronic Lyme disease to electromagnetic hypersensitivity. But perhaps most worrisome is the advance of anti-vaccine narratives across the web. The explosion of dubious sources has allowed them to propagate wildly, undeterred by debunking in the popular press. We might take the current drastic fall in HPV vaccine uptake in Ireland, driven by anti-vaccine groups like REGRET, despite its life-saving efficacy. While organisations including the Health Service Executive have valiantly tried to counter these myths, these claims are perpetuated across social media with little to stop them. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. The echo chamber may be comforting, but ultimately it locks us into perpetual tribalism, and does tangible damage to our understanding. To counteract this, we need to become more discerning at analysing our sources \u2013 something we are currently poor at doing. More difficult perhaps is that we must learn not to cling to something solely because it chimes with our beliefs, and be willing to jettison any notion when it is contradicted by evidence \u2013 no matter how comforting the disproven idea may be. As the great physicist Richard Feynman once observed, we ourselves are \u201cthe easiest person to fool\u201d. This adage should never be far from our minds in our interconnected world. From the dying embers of 2017, we must resolve to make 2018 the year of questioning not only our opponents\u2019 sources, but our own."
"33||Why wait for an appointment when you can see a GP via phone?Last month, I, alongside several colleagues, launched a new digital service that makes NHS GPs available to people \u2013 initially in London \u2013 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via their mobile phones. GP at Hand harnesses technology to cut down the wait for a routine GP appointment from the current average of around two weeks to just a matter of minutes via video consultation. Face-to-face appointments are available on the same day or next if needed. Like any other NHS service, it\u2019s free and means patients can see a GP when and where they want. There has been a lot of heated debate about this new service. This is good; we should discuss it. However, where there are myths or misinterpretations out there, my colleagues and I will try to dispel them. Critics claim the app will destabilise other practices. But most patients are happy with the practice they are at, and where people do move practices, the funding formula caters for this already. Primary care funding is not perfect, but a lot of thought has gone into matching payment to practice workload, and it will continue to evolve. NHS England should look closely at how patients react to our service, independently evaluating the outcomes, and we welcome its willingness to do so. Let\u2019s all learn from the real-world results, and worry a bit less about whether individual GPs like or loathe the service, because, well-intentioned or not, it is all too easy for the voice of our profession to drown out that of the patient. It is fundamental to the doctor-patient relationship that we all respect people\u2019s right to choose the GP practice that works best for them. If people want to join GP at Hand, that\u2019s great. If they wish to stay with their current GP, that\u2019s fine too. And if other GPs choose to innovate using new technology, so much the better. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned as a GP, it\u2019s that the patients I see every day are the ones who knows best about their own lives. The health service belongs to the people, as the NHS Constitution rightly says. GP at Hand is available to everyone living within our initial eligibility area: no exclusions, no restrictions, no cherry-picking. From pilots of the service in Essex and west London, we found it is popular with a broad range of patients, including elderly people \u2013 who find it difficult to get to a surgery \u2013 and families with young children. It is patronising to suggest older people can\u2019t benefit from this technology. Recent ONS figures show the proportion of older people using the internet to keep in touch with family members has doubled over the last six years. These figures also reveal women over 75 showed the greatest increase in internet use of any demographic group. The benefits of being able to see a GP quickly on your phone from the comfort of your home can be felt just as much by older people as they can be by younger, busy workers. NHS England has vetted our service, and provided us with some examples of conditions where, to be prudent, it feels it would be sensible for a patient to seek advice before registering for a digital-first service. These include people with complex mental health conditions, those requiring end of life care and people with drug dependence, among others. Our team is on hand to provide such advice. In the cases where an individual\u2019s health needs mean they are not suitable for a digital-first service, they can register at any traditional practice. For the vast majority of patients, old or young, our service is an appropriate method of GP care. Harnessing technology and digital innovation is critical to the future of our NHS. We have an ageing population and the NHS is under ever increasing pressure, with finite resources to deal with demand. GPs are coming under increasing strain too. GP registrations are up 10% in London alone. And that has knock-on effects, such as people going to A&amp;E when their problem could have been dealt with by a GP. If, as the government says, it wants to deliver a seven-day-a-week NHS, we have to start making use of the benefits and efficiencies technology can bring, as almost every other industry has. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll be able to continue meeting the ever increasing demand on our NHS while continuing to deliver first class care. In a world where we can FaceTime friends and relatives half way around the world, it makes sense to be able to have a video consultation with a doctor within minutes, rather than waiting weeks for an appointment. It means problems can be tackled early on, rather than being allowed to get worse while people wait to see a doctor. We live in a country populated by people with a wide variety of needs and preferences for how they live their lives. The NHS will flourish by providing care that respects these differences, and above all recognises patients\u2019 right to choose what works for them.

"24||US military agency invests $100m in genetic extinction technologiesA US military agency is investing $100m in genetic extinction technologies that could wipe out malarial mosquitoes, invasive rodents or other species, emails released under freedom of information rules show. The documents suggest that the US\u2019s secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) has become the world\u2019s largest funder of \u201cgene drive\u201d research and will raise tensions ahead of a UN expert committee meeting in Montreal beginning on Tuesday. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is debating whether to impose a moratorium on the gene research next year and several southern countries fear a possible military application. UN diplomats confirmed that the new email release would worsen the \u201cbad name\u201d of gene drives in some circles. \u201cMany countries [will] have concerns when this technology comes from Darpa, a US military science agency,\u201d one said. The use of genetic extinction technologies in bioweapons is the stuff of nightmares, but known research is focused entirely on pest control and eradication. Cutting-edge gene editing tools such as Crispr-Cas9 work by using a synthetic ribonucleic acid (RNA) to cut into DNA strands and then insert, alter or remove targeted traits. These might, for example, distort the sex-ratio of mosquitoes to effectively wipe out malarial populations. Some UN experts, though, worry about unintended consequences. One told the Guardian: \u201cYou may be able to remove viruses or the entire mosquito population, but that may also have downstream ecological effects on species that depend on them.\u201d \u201cMy main worry,\u201d he added, \u201cis that we do something irreversible to the environment, despite our good intentions, before we fully appreciate the way that this technology will work.\u201d Jim Thomas, a co-director of the ETC group which obtained the emails, said the US military influence they revealed would strengthen the case for a ban. \u201cThe dual use nature of altering and eradicating entire populations is as much a threat to peace and food security as it is a threat to ecosystems,\u201d he said. \u201cMilitarisation of gene drive funding may even contravene the Enmod convention against hostile uses of environmental modification technologies.\u201d Todd Kuiken, who has worked with the GBIRd programme, which receives $6.4m from Darpa, said that the US military\u2019s centrality to gene tech funding meant that \u201cresearchers who depend on grants for their research may reorient their projects to fit the narrow aims of these military agencies\u201d. Between 2008 and 2014, the US government spent about $820m on synthetic biology. Since 2012, most of this has come from Darpa and other military agencies, Kuiken says. In an email reporting a US military-organised conference in June, a US government biologist noted that Darpa\u2019s biotechnology program manager Renee Wegrzynhad said \u201cthe safe genes projects account [was] for $65m, but then mentioned with all other support in the room, it was $100m\u201d. A Darpa spokesman said that the figure was \u201ca liberal, notional estimate\u201d that included researchers at the meeting funded by Darpa under related efforts. \u201cDarpa is not and should not be the only funder of gene-editing research but it is critical for the Department of Defense to defend its personnel and preserve military readiness,\u201d he said. Darpa believes that a steep fall in the costs of gene-editing toolkits has created a greater opportunity for hostile or rogue actors to experiment with the technology. \u201cThis convergence of low cost and high availability means that applications for gene editing \u2013 both positive and negative \u2013 could arise from people or states operating outside of the traditional scientific community and international norms,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt is incumbent on Darpa to perform this research and develop technologies that can protect against accidental and intentional misuse.\u201d Gene-drive research has been pioneered by an Imperial College London professor, Andrea Crisanti, who confirmed he has been hired by Darpa on a $2.5m contract to identify and disable such drives. Fears that the research could be channeled towards bioweapons were \u201call fantasy\u201d, he said. \u201cThere is no way this technology could be used for any military purpose. The general interest is in developing systems to contain the undesired effects of gene drives. We have never been asked to consider any application not for the good of eliminating plagues.\u201d Interest in the technology among US army bureaus has shot up since a secret report by the elite Jason group of military scientists last year \u201creceived considerable attention among various agencies of the US government\u201d, according to an email by Gerald Joyce, who co-chaired a Jason study group in June. A second Jason report was commissioned in 2017 assessing \u201cpotential threats this technology might pose in the hands of an adversary, technical obstacles that must be overcome to develop gene drive technology and employ it \u2018in the wild\u2019,\u201d Joyce wrote. The paper would not be publicly disclosed but \u201cwidely circulated within the US intelligence and broader national security community\u201d, his email said."
"26||Could you still pass your driving theory test?Driving tests in England, Scotland and Wales change on Monday, with candidates now being required to demonstrate that they can follow the instructions of a sat-nav, and the period of independent driving during the test being doubled to 20 minutes. The number of rare road manoeuvres, such as reversing around a corner, has been reduced, and there will be an additional question about vehicle safety asked while driving. Examiners, unhappy that the changes may mean they have to work longer for no extra money, are planning to strike. Those wishing to pass their driving test must also still have passed a theory exam. See if you could still pass: Try your hand at some driving theory test questions In the real test candidates face 50 questions if they are seeking a licence for cars and motorcycles, and 100 questions if they want to drive lorries, buses and coaches. The pass mark for the 50 question test is 43. Additionally, would-be drivers have to take a video-based hazard perception test, which they also have to pass before being allowed to take the practical driving test. This quiz has used sample questions referring to the Highway Code as it applies to England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland has a different version of the Highway Code."
"2||Ashes 2017-18: Australia v England second Test, day three \u2013 as it happenedRead our report of day three, here: So, Australia end the day in control of the match despite a proud fightback from England in the second half of the day. Australia played by far the smarter cricket for the first two and a half days, and their first-innings lead of 215 will surely be decisive. England, at least, are going down swinging. Thanks for your company, night! 26th over: Australia 52-4 (Handscomb 3, Lyon 3) Woakes tempts Lyon into a loose drive that meets with nothing but fresh air. The next ball hits Lyon near the hip, and he goes down on his knees in an attempt to ensure this will be the last over of the day. It\u2019s a successful ruse, and that\u2019s the end of a thrilling day\u2019s play. 25th over: Australia 52-4 (Handscomb 3, Lyon 2) If England get Handscomb tonight they will think this match is winnable. He just about survives a superb over from Broad that includes an edge short of slip, a play and miss and an attempted leave that goes to slip on the bounce. 24th over: Australia 52-4 (Handscomb 3, Lyon 2) The new batsman is the nightwatchman Nathan Lyon, who edges his first ball fractional;ly short of third slip. \u201cIt\u2019s game on now,\u201d says Ricky Ponting on BT Sport. I still think Australia are well on top but it\u2019s been a rousing performance from Anderson and Woakes in particular. He\u2019s gone this time! Smith is squared up by a beauty from Woakes that seams away to hit the back leg in front of off stump. It was very tight, and Smith reviewed straight away, but the point of contact with both pad and stumps was umpire\u2019s call. It was just trimming the off bail. 23rd over: Australia 50-3 (Smith 6, Handscomb 3) Broad replaces Anderson, who bowled a largely brilliant spell of 11-7-16-2. There are 20 minutes to go before the close. Broad\u2019s first over isn\u2019t great, too wide and too short to Handscomb. \u201cDo you not think that if Smith wasn\u2019t so damn good, he would just look like some kind of parody?\u201d says Jon Vaughan. \u201cIf he ever loses form he is just going to look daft ...\u201d Yes, when his eyes eventually go it could be interesting. I can exclusively reveal his last 10 Test innings will be 167, 84, 101, 312, 97, 0, 1, 0, 0, -1. 22nd over: Australia 50-3 (Smith 6, Handscomb 3) Handscomb is willing himself to get forward, even if it doesn\u2019t come naturally, and he leans nicely into a cover drive for three off Woakes. Australia lead by 265. 21st over: Australia 47-3 (Smith 6, Handscomb 0) Smith gets off the mark with a firm flick through midwicket for four. Then Anderson traps him in front with a brilliant outswinger that pitched well outside leg stump. He almost didn\u2019t review that LBW decision earlier in the over. It looked like a terrible review, in truth, because it was hittimg middle stump halfway up, but the replays showed that more than half the ball pitched outside leg stump. Oh my goodness. England were certain they had Smith out for a duck. He got in a right mess, flicking across the line of a full-length inswinger from around the wicket by Anderson. It seemed to be plumb LBW but Smith reviewed it out of desperation and DRS suggested the ball pitched outside leg stump! England are not impressed with that. 20th over: Australia 41-3 (Smith 0, Handscomb 0) Handscomb edges his first ball just short of Cook at first slip. England realistically need at least two more wickets tonight, ideally four, if the miracle is to happen. These twilight variables are the great thing about day-night Test, which are the closest our generation will get to watching cricket on uncovered pitches. Warner has gone! That was an excellent delivery from Woakes, seaming away from a fullish length, and Warner edged it straight to Root at second slip. Warner goes for a selfless 60-ball 14. Australia lead by 256, and England - the wretched fools - are in danger of giving themselves a bit of hope. 19th over: Australia 39-2 (Warner 12, Smith 0) The pitch map shows that more than half England\u2019s deliveries in this innings have been short. That\u2019s quite surprising as it feels like they\u2019ve been fuller, if not full enough. Anderson\u2019s figures are 10-8-10-2. \u201cSo Rob, yesterday morning when Australia lost Handscomb at 209 we were saying that 250 was a good score and anything above 300 a real bonus, with hopes of getting them all out for somewhere in-between,\u201d says Paddy Murphy. \u201cObviously that didn\u2019t go to plan but does that mean our 227 is only just a little under par? Not that it matters really when on any view we are over 200 behind on the first innings..,\u201d I\u2019d be reluctant to blame the batsmen or the bowlers for the position England are in. It\u2019s only fair to blame both. They played really well for most of the Brisbane Test but in this game they have been crap. Anderson strikes again, trapping Khawaja LBW with a beautiful outswinger from around the wicket. Khawaja reviews, hoping he got outside the line. If this is overturned, after what happened with Shaun Marsh the other day, Anderson will go postal. It\u2019s out! The point of contact with both pad and stumps was umpire\u2019s call, so Australia don\u2019t lose a review. But they do lose Khawaja, who played very well for his 20. 18th over: Australia 38-1 (Warner 11, Khawaja 20) Bairstow is wincing every time he takes the ball behind the stumps. Warner is beaten by Woakes, which means more pain for Bairstow. The problem is with his left hand, and he had a couple of painkillers at the end of the previous over. \u201cIf they\u2019d batted first England may have reached 240/50, hypothesises Andrew Hurley (9th over),\u201d says Smylers. \u201cSeems a bit harsh to suggest they would reach only 240 for the loss of 50 wickets, but there may be something in the idea of England being allowed five innings before Australia even have one.\u201d Eight days into the series and already we\u2019re back at the altar of miserybanter. 17th over: Australia 37-1 (Warner 10, Khawaja 20) This is a long spell from Anderson, who is into his ninth over. It\u2019s another maiden, including a nasty lifter that raps Khawaja on the glove. Anderson\u2019s figures are pretty pretty: 9-7-9-1. \u201cWatching from afar, the real story of this Ashes so far has been how Warner has shelved his \u2018natural game\u2019,\u201d says Dileep Premachandran. \u201cSo often, you hear people using that as an excuse for reckless play. The discipline Warner has shown has been quite a revelation.\u201d Yes, I think the maturity and stealth of Australia\u2019s cricket \u2013 well, most of it - has really surprised England. Much of the talk before the series was about playing on the egos of the Aussie batsmen, but they have left their egos behind. 16th over: Australia 37-1 (Warner 10, Khawaja 20) Australia are over the worst, with Chris Woakes failing to trouble them. The only person he has inconveniced is Jonny Bairstow, who is in pain after taking a wobbling delivery on the finger. Woakes needs to pitch the ball up a lot more. Michael Vaughan may have coined a new phrase during this match: \u201cpretty bowling\u201d, when you beat the bat a lot and seem to be unlucky, but in reality have not bowled full enough because you are scared of being driven. And though England have been better in this innings, they have still been guilty of some pretty bowling. Andy Caddick was a very pretty bowler. \u201cI don\u2019t think the toss mattered,\u201d says Alistair Halton. \u201cWe\u2019re a good side but not good enough to beat them in Australia. Yes I think we should have batted but I think we\u2019d have got rolled for 240.\u201d I don\u2019t think it helped, but I suspect you\u2019re right. England had to get out of Brisbane with, as Alec Stewart put it in his 1998-99 tour diary, \u201c0 in the loss column\u201d. 15th over: Australia 35-1 (Warner 9, Khawaja 19) A few technical problems, sorry about that. BT Sport tell us that David Warner has left almost 50 per cent of the deliveries in this innings. You know you\u2019re in trouble when you are getting lessons from Warner in defensive batting. England\u2019s shot-selection was desperate this morning. 13th over: Australia 32-1 (Warner 9, Khawaja 17) A maiden from Anderson to the watchful Warner, who has nine from 36 balls. It\u2019s been another mature innings. You suspect that, if he survives until the close, he will be rewarded handsomely for his patience tomorrow. His strike rate in this series is 57, his lowest in Australia. \u201cAh, TMS beat me to it,\u201d says Tom Bowtell. \u201cOverton second highest by a top-scoring number 9 on debut behind Charlie Absalom\u2019s 52 in 1878-79. Previous instance was Jack Board, top scoring with 29 in Feb 1899. So first to do it for 118 years.\u201d 12th over: Australia 32-1 (Warner 9, Khawaja 17) Craig Overton replaces Stuart Broad and is thick-edged for four by Khawaja, who softened his hands at the point of impact. A dismal short ball is pulled sweetly for four more. Australia lead by 247, and the only thing that can stop them winning this game is an apocalypse. \u201cI don\u2019t want to start an inquest yet, but it is hard to see Bayliss surviving a whitewash against this workmanlike Aussie side,\u201d says Phil White. \u201cThe suspicion that he is out of the loop on county cricket is gaining weight here. How about a Paul Collingwood &amp; Angus Fraser double act to take the reins next?\u201d Usually an Ashes whitewash ends a few careers, but Andrew Strauss has a cooler head than most. I\u2019m not sure England will want to, or should, get rid of Bayliss with the World Cup 18 months away, especially as that was the main reason he got the job. 11th over: Australia 24-1 (Warner 9, Khawaja 9) A big outswinger from Anderson beats Khawaja\u2019s outside edge by a mile. Bairstow still appeals for caught behind. Warner flicks his first boundary off the pads. \u201cMark White needs to give it a chance - this is one of the best places for an Australian supporter to be,\u201d says Eamonn Maloney. \u201cWhen things get grim for England the ennui can be so complete as to be nourishing. During the \u201807 series I lived off nothing but the OBO and Ryvita.\u201d In other news... 10th over: Australia 19-1 (Warner 5, Khawaja 8) Warner chips Broad not far wide of midwicket for three. It\u2019s definitely becoming less uncomfortable for Australia\u2019s batsmen, although there\u2019s still enough going on for Broad to beat Khawaja outside off stump. Meanwhile, Tom Bowtell is trying to find out who the last England lower-order batsman (Nos 8-11) before Craig Overton to top score on his Test debut. Anyone? Anyone? Fry? \u201cMorally speaking, Australia are 12-4 just now,\u201d says Paul O\u2019Neill. \u201cBroad and Anderson making reparations for the first morning.\u201d What the world needs now is not love, sweet love: it\u2019s Expected Wickets data. 9th over: Australia 15-1 (Warner 2, Khawaja 7) Khawaja is playing very well and defends throughout another maiden from Anderson. He has figures of 5-4-4-1. It\u2019s interesting that, for all the seductive swing, Anderson\u2019s pitch map shows that 62 per cent of his deliveries have been short of a length. \u201cImagine if England had batted first (ie, if Root had thought outside the box) - yes they might have been bowled out for 240/50 but at least would have had a go at Australia in the evening session which is a huge advantage, as we now see (and all knew beforehand),\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cRoot doesn\u2019t seem to have any of those ingredients it takes to be a good captain.\u201d That last sentence feels a bit harsh but I agree that the decision to bat first was a bit ... confused, not least because this England team are terrible batting under scoreboard pressure. 8th over: Australia 15-1 (Warner 2, Khawaja 7) Warner chases a very wide delivery from Broad and is beaten. \u201cDid he nick that?\u201d says Stuart Broad to Jonny Bairstow. England only have one review left so they can\u2019t risk it. Batting is becoming slightly more comfortable at Broad\u2019s end. \u201cIs it cowardly to pray for smog?\u201d says John Dalby. \u201cI\u2019ll get my coat. And mask.\u201d 7th over: Australia 12-1 (Warner 2, Khawaja 5) Warner just about gets something on a big Anderson inswinger before being beaten by a lifting legcutter. It\u2019s brilliant bowling, in very helpful conditions, and with a bit more luck Australia could be three down. \u201cRe: your comment on Anderson at 0918,\u201d says Indy Bagral. \u201cYes he\u2019s had some good series but the averages don\u2019t lie - outside of England he\u2019s just not that much of a threat. Plus, everyone seems to ignore the fact that it\u2019s a lot easier to look like a better bowler when your batsmen have just put up 8 million for 2 to defend (Aus 10-11).\u201d Of course he\u2019s not as good outside England \u2013 he\u2019s a swing bowler. But the idea that he\u2019s useless, or that he can\u2019t use the Kookaburra, is unfair, I think. 6th over: Australia 12-1 (Warner 2, Khawaja 5) Warner is beaten by a preposterous leg-cutter from Broad, and then Khawaja softens his hands to edge Broad short of the slips and through for four. He and Warner are doing well in desperately difficult conditions. \u201cG\u2019day Rob,\u201d says Mark White. \u201cHow are you? Do you need a hug? Um, given that your website now operates in Australia and not just as a colonial operation from the MCC, could you at least try and be a little less YAY ENGLAND OH SHIT ENGLAND - and report the game?\u201d Please all join me in congratulating Mark on his appointment as the Guardian\u2019s new Head of Sport. 5th over: Australia 7-1 (Warner 1, Khawaja 1) With the ball swinging, Australia are focussing exclusively on survival. Khawaja is beaten by consecutive outswingers from Anderson, who is making the ball talk like Brian Blessed. 4th over: Australia 7-1 (Warner 1, Khawaja 1) Warner is drawn towards a wide, full delivery from Broad that slips past the edge. If England can bowl Australia out for 60-odd, they might just win this game. If that happened, I doubt I\u2019d ever stop laughing. It won\u2019t happen. But they are causing all sorts of problems, with Khawaja also beaten in that over from Broad. \u201cMust be reverse commentator\u2019s curse - the Channel 9 commentary here in Australia started with Warnie bagging James Anderson as useless outside of England!\u201d says Alistair Gillett. \u201cAmazing bowling so far.\u201d That perception really irritates me. Anderson\u2019s stats away from home aren\u2019t as good but he has bowled wonderfully in a number of series - Australia 2010-11, Pakistan 2011-12, India 2012-13 and Pakistan 2015-16, to name four. 3rd over: Australia 5-1 (Warner 0, Khawaja 0) Khawaja is beaten first up by a glorious inswinger that just misses the off bail. This is Anderson at his regal best, and that was a superb wicket maiden. Bancroft edges Anderson just short of slip but falls to the next ball, thin-edging a lovely outswinger through to Jonny Bairstow. This is so much better from England, who are pitching it up and have the chance to run through Australia tonight. 2nd over: Australia 5-0 (Bancroft 4, Warner 0) Stuart Broad starts with a wide. Outstanding stuff. He pitches the ball up after that, and beats Warner outside off stump with an absolute beauty. Jonny Bairstow thinks there was an edge, but Broad doesn\u2019t appeal and signals that he heard nothing. Joe Root reviews. Not for the first time in this match, it\u2019s a decision he soon regrets. There\u2019s nothing on Hotspot or Snicko, so Warner survives and England have lost a review. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Bancroft 4, Warner 0) Jimmy Anderson, heavily criticised for not bowling full enough in the first innings, starts the innings with two short balls. Tremendous stuff. He does pitch it up later in the over, and almost nails Bancroft with a swinging yorker. Next stop, rocket science. The over ends with Bancroft thick-edging a full delivery for four. Australia will bat again. See disintegration, mental. Australia lead by 215 on first innings They have the chance to enforce the follow on, though I suspect they will bat again. That\u2019s it. Anderson misses a sweep and is hit flush in the man zone. That\u2019s plumb LBW, or GBW if you prefer, and Craig Overton is left high and dry on 41 not out. 76th over: England 227-9 (Overton 41, Anderson 0) That was a beautiful catch from Paine to dismiss Broad, because there was sharp turn and bounce and then a deviation off the edge. Overton, meanwhile, misses an attempted slog sweep at a bouncer from Cummins. Seriously. 75th over: England 227-9 (Overton 41, Anderson 0) \u201cHullo Rob,\u201d says Alistair Connor. \u201cWith respect to surprising LBW decisions, am I the first to call a Russian hack on DRS? The Huggy Bear team, or whatever they\u2019re called. OK, as conspiracy theories generally do, it has a weak point: why would the Russians want to favour Aus ? But Putin must have his reasons, he is the geopolitical chess grandmaster, he\u2019s three moves ahead.\u201d I was thinking about this last night, in bed, in my briefs. See also: that Tendulkar LBW in the 2011 World Cup semi-final. We trust technology implicitly but what if some gunk-faced geek thought, \u2018Nah, I\u2019m not having that\u2019 and hacked the system? Gone, gone, gone. Lyon gets one to spit nastily at Broad, who tries to work to leg and gets a thin edge through to Tim Paine. 74th over: England 227-8 (Overton 41, Broad 3) A short ball from Cummins hits Broad in the chest and is nicely taken by the swooping Bancroft at short leg. It would have been another fine catch, had Broad hit it. \u201cA good friend of mine who now lives in the bright lights of \u2018Just Outside London\u2019, and is (frustratingly) a better musician than me, was back in West Wales over the weekend to see family,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI met up with him on Saturday, and we jammed on some 90\u2019s-tastic grunge and rock. Excellent. On Sunday, I went to visit my family. That means a Chinese takeaway. You haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen my five-year-old son shovel away fried rice. I didn\u2019t fancy Chinese, though, so I went for a kebab meat and chips. The meal that got me through the \u2018Learning to drink years.\u2019 Wonderful. Anyway, the point is, my weekend had the feel of an ersatz 90s tribute. Waking up to this scoreline just seems right. Not pleasant, not nice, not good, but right. Damned, annoyingly, painfully right.\u201d Oh, this has definitely been ersatz. It could win every ersatz award going. 73rd over: England 224-8 (Overton 40, Broad 2) Australia go back to Nathan Lyon for the first over after dinner. Overton gives him the charge and scrunches a cracking boundary through mid-off to move into the forties. He\u2019s been a beacon of cheer in a thoroughly miserable match for England. Dinner-table conversation \u201cMorning Rob, how\u2019s it going?\u201d says David Horn. \u201cOh. There\u2019s much talk of bringing in Mark Wood in for the third Test ... but here\u2019s a thing ... I understand that he \u2018brings something different\u2019 has \u2018a bit of X-Factor\u2019 etc. but he also brings a bowling average over 40, with 3 wickets for 80-odd as his best return. Let\u2019s not get too excited. It\u2019s also unclear how he\u2019s going to slot in to our top six.\u201d Yes, he needs a run of games to get familiar with Test cricket, which is the one thing he\u2019s never going to get. He is a bloody good bowler, though. With an attack of Anderson, Broad, Wood and Stokes, England might just have lost this series 4-1! \u201cI had a vivid dream that we were following on so when I woke up at 6.30 I was pleasantly surprised to see us still batting in our first innings,\u201d says Simon Tomlinson. \u201cIt\u2019s still going to be 5-0 or 4-1 though, isn\u2019t it? Even in English conditions I don\u2019t think we\u2019d beat this lot.\u201d As someone who put a decent amount of money on 5-0, I feel a weird combination of smugness and despair. I don\u2019t agree with the last bit though, I think England would win pretty comfortably at home. Not 5-0, because we can\u2019t do ruthless, but maybe 3-1. 72nd over: England 219-8 (Overton 36, Broad 1) Broad pre-empts a short ball from Starc, jumps across his crease and gets four leg-byes when the ball deflects off his rump. Since you asked me to curse Overton, by the way, the last England lower-order batsman (Nos 8-11) to score a fifty against Australia on his Test debut was Paul Allott in 1981. The last to do it against any opposition was Liam Dawson in Chennai a year ago. Right, that\u2019s dinner. It was a better session for England - but they still lost it, with Australia taking the wickets of Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow and Chris Woakes, all of them caught and bowled. See you in half an hour for the twilight session. \u201cI was here through the pain earlier,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cAnyone expressing hope needs to stand in the corner and think about the decisions that have brought them to a point where hope is so important to them that reality is of no consequence. Go Brexit yourself.\u201d 71st over: England 213-8 (Overton 36, Broad 0) Hazlewood replaces Lyon and rams a couple of short balls past the head of Overton, who sways nicely out the way. He has batted beautifully for a lower-order batsman on debut. When Hazlewood gives him a bit of width he cuffs the ball up and over the cordon for four. 70th over: England 208-8 (Overton 31, Broad 0) \u201cContrary to \u2018The Fear\u2019, I have \u2018The Hope\u2019,\u201d says Venugopal Mani. \u201cImagine we somehow get to 250 and Broad produces absolute magic and skittles them out under the lights for 100-odd. You think we can chase down 300? I think it is possible given how well Broad has bowled to this very same team in the past.\u201d No. Hope this helps! England could skittle Australia tonight but I wouldn\u2019t trust them to chase 200, never mind 300. A third England batsman is out caught-and-bowled. Woakes tries to pull, is beaten for pace and lobs a simple return catch to Starc. That was a good innings, 36 from 62 balls, but he\u2019ll regret the manner of his dismissal. 69th over: England 206-7 (Woakes 35, Overton 30) Lyon, bowling around the wicket, has an optimisitc appeal for LBW turned down by Chris Gaffaney. It was missing leg. We\u2019re around 15 minutes away from dinner. 68th over: England 206-7 (Woakes 35, Overton 30) Overton squirts a thick edge along the ground for three, the last of those from an overthrow. This partnership has probably ensured Australia won\u2019t enforce the follow-on, even if they have the chance to do so. After a hard day\u2019s work, the fast bowlers probably won\u2019t fancy overtime. 67th over: England 202-7 (Woakes 34, Overton 27) Overton hoicks Lyon over square leg for four, an excellent shot that brings up the 200. This is a really impressive partnership, which has raised one small question: WHAT WERE YOU TOP-ORDER GALOOTS DOING EARLIER TODAY YOU IMPATIENT, WEAK-WILLED \u201c\u00a3$(*!$ERS?! 66th over: England 195-7 (Woakes 32, Overton 22) Starc slips an excellent delivery past Overton\u2019s outside edge. That\u2019s the length to bowl to competent lower-order batsmen, certainly once their eye is in. He does it again two balls later and glares at Overton in disgust. A superb maiden ends with a third delivery that beats the bat; this time he and Overton smile at each other in acknowledgement of fortune\u2019s fickle finger. 65th over: England 195-7 (Woakes 32, Overton 22) Nathan Lyon comes back into the attack. A decent first over, one from it. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d come to work to avoid the cricket,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cBut here I am, at my desk at 7am because watching an hour at home after feeding my three-month old was just too much to stomach, and I was there in the 90s. At least she\u2019s too young to remember this farrago. Thing is, we\u2019re no dirt-trackers, but we\u2019ve properly lobbed this down the u-bend. A cricketing suicide.\u201d 64th over: England 194-7 (Woakes 32, Overton 21) Mitchell Starc replaces Pat Cummins. Woakes drives two through the covers and then uppercuts a little streakily for four. That brings up the fifty partnership, England\u2019s first since the first innings of the Brisbane Test. 63rd over: England 187-7 (Woakes 26, Overton 20) A rare full delivery from Hazlewood is square-driven beautifully for four by Woakes, down on one knee in the Caribbean style. Four leg-byes take England closer to the magical 200 mark. These two have played admirably, which makes the morning session even more miserable for England fans. \u201cMorning Rob,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say there are no Australians in coach A on the 0654 Wellingborough to St. Pancras. Uniformly glum faces and defeated demeanour. I\u2019m thinking of starting a sing song starting with \u2018Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag\u2019 to try and restore morale. I think I\u2019d be thrown off the train at Bedford though.\u201d The Monday-morning commute and an Ashes batting collapse. It\u2019s English misery bingo. 62nd over: England 177-7 (Woakes 21, Overton 19) The consensus is that, were this a day game, Australia wouldn\u2019t enforce the follow-on. But if they dismiss England around dinner, the temptation to put them in again under lights will be enormous. They might even finish the game tonight. 61st over: England 175-7 (Woakes 21, Overton 17) Woakes shovels Hazlewood just short of long leg, and then Overton pushes nicely through mid-on for three. That makes this the highest partnership of the innings: 33 runs. Morning (what\u2019s so effing good about it) 60th over: England 169-7 (Woakes 19, Overton 14) Cummins. Fill in the blanks. Short, Overton fending, Woakes dodging. Then popping one up on the leg side, but it carries over the short leg fieldsman and lands safe. How long will this method of attack continue? \u201cI love a good nineties tribute\u201d writes Robert Wolf Peterson. \u201cCurrently gorging myself on Opal Fruits (not Starburst), Marathons (not Snickers), and misguided fin-de-siecle optimism. Can\u2019t wait to see whether Blur or Oasis will be number one at the weekend.\u201d Well, from here, direct your emails to Rob Smyth if you please. That is drinks, which means it\u2019s also the end of my OBO for the day. Go well. 59th over: England 166-7 (Woakes 18, Overton 13) Hazlewood bowls another couple of snorters when it comes to the short ball. But when it\u2019s full, Overton drives another square boundary for four. Looked very good, that stroke. Ah, there\u2019s Clem Hill. He made 98 and 97, in fact, at Adelaide. One of the great Ashes Tests, when Australia chased 315 in the last innings and did it six wickets down. Hugh Trumble took 6-for in bowling out England for 247 in the third innings. But Len Braund had made a hundred in the first, then Hill and Victor Trumper struck back in the second. Hill, Joe Darling and Trumble saw Australia home in the fourth. \u201cI\u2019m a bit late on this riff,\u201d says Lee Henderson, \u201cbut...\u201d \u201cI grew up with Clem Hill pic on my bedroom wall, the famous scoreboard pic with other famous names from the Golden Era of Cricket stuck out. The swagger the old cricketers displayed in their pics with one hand on bat as you lean with other arm on hip, marvellous!\u201d 58th over: England 161-7 (Woakes 18, Overton 8) Cummins back for Starc from the River End. A couple of singles nudged and prodded, then Overton decides to fight fire with fire. He almost charges Cummins, clears the front leg and pastes the pull shout out to deep backward square. The only dampener is that Hazlewood has gone down there to rest, and he\u2019s able to come around the boundary, slap the bouncing ball down as its about to cross the rope, then come back into the field of play to pick it up. A likely boundary becomes a single. Woakes pulls a couple more runs out to a similar spot, just square enough of Hazlewood to get back for the second despite a clever bit of tandem fielding with Lyon in the deep. 57th over: England 157-7 (Woakes 15, Overton 7) Josh Hazlewood back in the attack for Lyon, from the Cathedral End. Lovely stuff too. He\u2019s not the fastest of these Australian quicks, but he\u2019s just bowled three of the best-directed bouncers. Overton does well, sniffing leather as he gets his head out of the way. He also gets one that nearly takes the edge to Paine, but dies on its way to the cordon, and gets a short ball with just enough width to draw a perfect little cut shot for four! No flourish, just tucking the elbow into the hip and chopping it down into the ground and away through the gully for four. 56th over: England 153-7 (Woakes 15, Overton 3) Starc continues his reign. Woakes manages to bunt a run to cover. Overton fends one just past short leg, almost under Bancroft\u2019s arm there. Gets away with it, just too close to the body for the fieldsman to get his hand to it. Starc finishes up with a short wide ball, and a relieved Woakes slams it for four! Cut Shot City Limits. That 150 milestone has at least been passed. Brian Withington represents quite a few people on the communication channels who aren\u2019t great fans of Boycott on the radio waves. \u201cOnly thing worse than watching England suffer is listening to the greatest living Yorkshireman explaining ad nauseum how inadequate everyone is. Batting is easy, it\u2019s simple, just do as I say. I seem to recall he wasn\u2019t averse to make it very easy from the non-striker\u2019s end and picking and choosing his tours. He can\u2019t even praise Lyon without sticking the knife in Moeen\u2019s bowling and batting. Ponting far classier with bat and microphone.\u201d 55th over: England 147-7 (Woakes 10, Overton 2) Overton mistimes a drive but is able to double his tally of Test runs from the shot. Woakes nicks a ball past slip for three more. This is... not convincing, is the nicest thing I can say about England\u2019s batting. On email, Yum is getting philosophical. \u201cIf you trash talk but you actually do what you say you\u2019re going to do, is it still technically regarded as trash talk?\u201d 54th over: England 143-7 (Woakes 7, Overton 1) Poor old Craig Overton. On Test debut, coming out \u201cwith England deep in the mire,\u201d as Agnew calls it. Facing Mitchell Starc for his first ball in Test cricket. Guess where it\u2019s going to pitch? And that is fast. Genuinely quick. I didn\u2019t catch the speedo for that one, but I saw Johnson\u2019s famous spell here in 2013, and that ball looked every bit as quick. Overton ducks it, then fends off the next for a run. Relief for him, he\u2019d previously made two ducks on tour. Gets off the mark in Test cricket. I spoke too soon. Another unlikely wicket in athletic fashion, as Bairstow drives hard back past Starc. Well, nearly past him. Starc threw up his right hand in his follow-through, clipped the ball with that arm, and rebounded it up in the air. Somehow Starc was able to twist his spine around, fling that hand back, and snare the ball as it came down behind him. 53rd over: England 142-6 (Bairstow 21, Woakes 7) Lyon to Woakes, who prods around for a while before he can get off strike. Alex McClelland is emailing in: \u201cAs an Englander who has been in this land since 1997 this is all rather familiar. My question is; assuming England are all out for around 150 (and the word \u2018assuming\u2019 lends that phrase an undeserved level of doubt), what would the Aussies see as more humiliating: enforcing the follow on and bowling them out again for less than their first innings total, or batting and giving Root\u2019s boys a ludicrous 500 or so to chase in their last innings? Decisions, decisions...\u201d Well, they might just get the 150 from here. 52nd over: England 140-6 (Bairstow 20, Woakes 6) Starc bowling rockets. Nearly gets Woakes\u2019 edge again, but the batsman yanks the bat away as a ball flew threw at ribcage height. There\u2019s a third slip standing 30% closer to the batsman than the others in the cordon, and wearing a helmet. Must be there for a fend or a gloved ball, given quite a few haven\u2019t carried all the way. Two singles in the over. 51st over: England 138-6 (Bairstow 19, Woakes 5) Contrasting styles, Lyon and Starc, but equal danger. Lyon has Bairstow edging past his stumps, Woakes edging into his pad past short leg, then very nearly Woakes nicking behind. He\u2019s bowling beeeeeautifully, the shiny-headed one. In the meantime, Glenn McGrath is stuck in the left. If only Michael Vaughan were in there too, like at Lord\u2019s in 2013. Those were halcyon days. 50th over: England 137-6 (Bairstow 18, Woakes 5) Ok, buckle up. Starc to Woakes. After the Gabba, this will only go one way. And it does. Woakes ducking and dodging, before playing at one outside off that he shouldn\u2019t have been near. Needs a comeback. Finds one, smashed for four! Got every piece of the pull shot that splits the two men in the deep. 49th over: England 133-6 (Bairstow 18, Woakes 1) Stunning stuff. A blinder. Not fair, when you\u2019re the team struggling, that someone can do that against you. Woakes gets off the mark with a nudge to cover. England still 309 behind. Obviously he can\u2019t do much about that, but he has to try. What an incredible catch! Moeen looking to be proactive, he\u2019d already driven a chip over cover for two runs in that over, and the off-side field was stacked for him with the ball spinning away. So he tried to go straighter, more to mid-on. Didn\u2019t get to the pitch of the ball and pushed it away in the air. But it should have been safe. It should have been a couple of dicey runs. It shouldn\u2019t have had Nathan Lyon levitate across the wicket, horizontal, and clasp the ball in his despairingly outstretched left hand. Lyon was yards off the cut strip by the time he landed. What incredible work from him, after that run-out in Brisbane. His newfound athleticism in the field is changing games. 48th over: England 130-5 (Moeen 23, Bairstow 18) Starc to continue, having had his daily rest. The left-armer is coming around the wicket to the right-handed Bairstow. Has him groping and missing for a fast full toss, then rising up on his toes and dropping the gloves under a shorter one just on off stump. A few leaves in that over, and you\u2019d think Starc will start attacking the stumps or the collarbone more in the next. In fact Clem Hill made... I think a 98 and a 99, in the same Test match, on this very ground? Something around that mark. 47th over: England 130-5 (Moeen 23, Bairstow 18) Nice and positive start from Moeen, who moved down the wicket to drive Lyon smoothly through cover first ball after tea. Only got a single for it to the sweeper, deserved at least two. Bairstow misses out on a far less elegant sweep-swat, down on one knee, to a short ball that could have had the treatment. It bounces instead to leg slip, who is waiting there for the upper side of the glove. The batsman gets a single square next ball. Gervase Greene, who is also a Philadelphia suburb, emails in. \u201cA propos Adam Collins\u2019 earlier marvelling at the statue of Clem Hill, it is worth recalling that Hill - who ended his career as the highest aggregate scorer ever - was famous for his terrible nerves as he approached a century. In three or four consecutive Innings he was out in the late-90s. Indeed, so sick with nerves did he become that the media wags dubbed him Clem \u2018ill. I dare say OBO readers in the home country now might empathise...\u201d A mere 314 behind, and five whole wickets in hand. All is going to plan. No, let us not be facetious. This was a disastrous morning for England. Alastair Cook looked in excellent touch but was undone by Nathan Lyon once again. Joe Root didn\u2019t look in excellent touch and once again couldn\u2019t influence the contest. Leadership needed to come from the front, but in the end it is being left to the inexperienced and the lower middle order. Well, quite, and they\u2019ve done well so far. Let\u2019s see where it tops out. Mo-bi wan Kenobi, you\u2019re my only hope. But while that partnership continues, England are still here. Let not despair clutch you yet, if you\u2019re of the Three Lions persuasion. Though if you\u2019re more an emu-and-kangaroo sort, you can probably feel quietly confident. Short break, remember - we\u2019ll resume shortly. 46th over: England 128-5 (Moeen 22, Bairstow 17) Cummins to bowl it. Bairstow jams a single. Moeen drives nicely, simply, straight past the bowler and Warner\u2019s chase back is successful this time keeping them to three runs. Bairstow leaves the second-last ball, then punches a couple of runs through midwicket. So a productive bonus over for England in the end, with six runs from it, and that is the 20-minute tea break. Greg Ryan is our Czech mate, reporting from Teplice. \u201cMorning Geoff, as a counter to the gloomy mornings of my English northern hemisphere contemporaries, there\u2019s nothing much more exciting than getting up early on a snowy morning to read OBO and see how Australia is doing. Especially good when playing the Old Dart. A bit like Christmas morning 5 days in a row times 5 tests! Na zdravi!\u201d 45th over: England 122-5 (Moeen 19, Bairstow 14) Mid-off set well back for Moeen, and staying there as mid-on for Bairstow, so they\u2019ve taken a couple of easy singles that way. The over finishes just in time to sneak one more in before the tea break. England missed a trick there. 44th over: England 118-5 (Moeen 17, Bairstow 12) Cummins to Bairstow, who cover-drives for four! That\u2019s the risk-reward of his game. Full ball there and he covered the line well. Warner gives up the chase, and he never gives up the chase. He\u2019s like some kind of non-giving-up school guy. 43rd over: England 114-5 (Moeen 17, Bairstow 8) Moeen comes down the wicket and tries to slam Lyon way down the ground, but only drags it to mid-off. Bairstow bunts through leg, then Moeen nearly nicks off as Lyon spins one away. 42nd over: England 112-5 (Moeen 16, Bairstow 7) Bairstow flashes outside off again! This time off the back foot, a forcing stroke. Cummins with too much pace. Three slips, gully, point. Plenty of space down the ground, so when he gets one pitched up, Bairstow drives straight for four. Not perfectly timed but got enough of it to lazily beat the chase. Cummins comes back to beat the edge again. \u201cIf they collapse, enforce the follow on?\u201d asks David Marshall. \u201cNew ball, under lights, night time session\u2026 this thing writes itself. Wrap it up by afternoon tea tomorrow.\u201d That would certainly be a tactical consideration that the day-night format adds to the mix. You wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to bat a second time starting in the evening session. Or waste the chance with the ball. 41st over: England 107-5 (Moeen 15, Bairstow 3) Mo tucks a single, Bairstow has the early jitters out of his system and blocks out Lyon\u2019s over. Dan Ellis-Jones is \u201csitting 2 and a half hours behind, on the other side if the Nullarbor. As a Pom working in WA state government, trying to nefariously make Australian cricket wins illegal in this state, I\u2019m facing an uphill battle. Surrounded by Aussies, it\u2019s particularly painful to scrape around for sporting victories to retaliate with. So, please pass on to the English cricket team the anguish unknown to those at home when England lose to Australia. A depression that even surpasses losing to Iceland. Please win. Whatever the cost!\u201d I\u2019ll... do my best. They\u2019ve nearly got the deficit under 300. 40th over: England 106-5 (Moeen 14, Bairstow 3) More yelps as Bairstow nearly chips up a catch back down the wicket. It lands safely. Hard to time Cummins\u2019 pace. Katich on the wireless with the best summary: \u201cThe Australians batted with a lot more patience, they were a lot more watchful. England have been reckless today.\u201d Cummins nearly draws a nick from Bairstow. Not much is inspiring confidence in England\u2019s batting. \u201cWorst technological advance of the past few years?\u201d offers Alex Graywod. \u201cWifi on planes. I can now follow today\u2019s England collapse despite currently being approximately 38,000 ft above Turkey. A new high for a OBO letter (whilst England look set to plumb new lows)?\u201d 39th over: England 106-5 (Moeen 14, Bairstow 3) Moeen has to go back into his shell now, facing out five balls from Lyon for a single. Bairstow draws a yelp as he dinks a run round the corner. \u201cBarry Robran was a footballer?\u201d asks David Markham. \u201cI thought the statue related to his 2 Sheffield Shield games for SA in the early 70s. I just checked \u2013 he scored 28 runs at an average of 7.\u201d 38th over: England 104-5 (Moeen 13, Bairstow 2) Jonny Bairstow in next. This will be interesting, after all the back and forth at Brisbane. He punches a couple through cover, then lines up a huge drive down the ground aside from the bit where you need to hit the ball. \u201cHe always starts his innings like he\u2019s 45 not out,\u201d says Jonathan Agnew on ABC. Strange dismissal. First ball of the Cummins spell and he gets a back-of-a-length ball to move off the seam. Moved into Malan, who was just looking to work it away for a single somewhere, but the seam beat him, and the bounce beat him, and in the end it beat the bat on the inside, took his glove, and went through to the keeper. 37th over: England 102-4 (Malan 19, Moeen 13) Moeen versus Lyon, offie versus offie, and the Englishman gets down and wallops the sweep for four! That feels so good that he does it again. Moeen starting to find his range. He\u2019s always better when he\u2019s expressing himself, one feels. 36th over: England 93-4 (Malan 18, Moeen 5) Hazlewood bowling a normal length to start this over, then goes back to the short ball. Couple of singles. In today\u2019s episode of Obscure Stat Time, we have seen Nathan \u2018Nathan\u2019 Lyon move past Mitchell Johnson for Test wickets taken on the Adelaide Oval. Lyon is now outright sixth, with 32. Ahead of him: Grimmett, McDermott, Lillee, McGrath, Warne. 35th over: England 91-4 (Malan 17, Moeen 4) Edged! Was it? Maybe it missed the edge. Lyon bowling, and that ball took off from this wicket, flew past the edge and into Paine\u2019s shoulder behind the stumps. It was nicked on the replay. Hit the keeper on his left elbow as he tried to get his hands up. Not a dropped catch there, that one flew at him, high and wide. No one could have got that. Moeen gets a lucky run from the rebound. 34th over: England 89-4 (Malan 16, Moeen 3) Malan finally gives in to the pull shot here, and keeps it down from Hazlewood for a single to the deep. Not sure about the value of having Hazlewood send down so much of the short stuff when he\u2019s so good at a fuller length. Four short balls in the over. Still, Brian Withington sends through a comms stats that \u201cAustralia\u2019s opening bowlers averaging 1.5m fuller deliveries than England\u2019s on first innings , with Jimmy the worst culprit for keeping back of a length.\u201d That bears out observations from yesterday. People are blaming Root, but it was such a waste from Anderson. 33rd over: England 88-4 (Malan 15, Moeen 3) Lyon sends down a maiden to Moeen. Hard for England to know what to do here. 32nd over: England 88-4 (Malan 15, Moeen 3) Right, the exam is over. Starc has to go and have a rest. Hazlewood comes back. You can see what Dirk means. Though his first ball is off the mark, a full and straying one that takes the pad and flies down for four leg byes. Moeen is doing the sensible thing, covering up thereafter. Glances a run to fine leg. \u201cHello from Adelaide Oval,\u201d writes Isaac Forster. \u201cOn the DRS subject I am slightly perplexed by the complaints. The Shaun Marsh one was the closest but if you look at a side on replay he was batting out of the crease and took a big stride forward. For both Paine and Malan the immediate reaction from all on the hill was too high, vindicated on the replays.\u201d From my vantage point, the one this morning looked a bit high at a glance, and the other two looked dead. Paine even more than Marsh. Live, and on replays, I would have been giving those out for 30 years. Maybe DRS is showing us things we\u2019ve been getting wrong forever. 31st over: England 83-4 (Malan 15, Moeen 2) \u201cYou don\u2019t get the sense that there\u2019s any respite,\u201d says Dirk Nannes on the radio. \u201cWhen Australia was batting you only thought there were a couple of wicket-takers.\u201d Lyon is all over Moeen again, probing away, an an eventual single dinked to leg is all that comes from the over. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, now our No.6 comes in and scores a century, that\u2019s what they do isn\u2019t it?\u201d You\u2019ve watched cricket, Henry Wood, you know how it works. 30th over: England 82-4 (Malan 15, Moeen 1) Malan gets away from Starc earlier than usual, with another leg-slip fend, and it\u2019s Moeen who has to take up the parade of ducks and dodges. Gets one full ball to drive for a single. Richard King is harking back to those statues. \u201cThey might be \u20184 football players\u2019 to you mate but one of them is Barry Robran - if you took the Don and melded in Sir Garfield you might have some idea of what he meant to footy in SA.\u201d Indeed, they don\u2019t tend to make bronze statues of people who weren\u2019t significant in some way. When I next get time to write the history of the SANFL during an OBO, I\u2019ll send an alert. 29th over: England 80-4 (Malan 14, Moeen 0) A wicket from the first ball, and a maiden to follow. Lyon beats Moeen three times in that over. \u201cSuddenly he\u2019s bowling hand grenades,\u201d says Jim Maxwell on the wireless. And hello. On the replays, one of those balls may have been a nick. Moeen forced off the back foot, missed the ball, and snicko shows the tiniest of tiny spikes as the ball passes the back corner of the edge of the bat. So faint even the keeper wasn\u2019t sure. He appealed but didn\u2019t press for a review. Inception. Punish\u00e9d, punish\u00e9d, all are punish\u00e9d! Fazeer comes in again. Lyon bowls that wide, too wide for Cook to be playing. The England opener\u2019s decision-making abandons him this time. He was only defending, but he didn\u2019t need to play that ball, and it ends up with Smith at slip. Went at it with hard hands. Unnecessary. My century vibes were wrong. England on the brink. 28th over: England 80-3 (Cook 37, Malan 14) The scheduled hydration interval has passed, and a refreshed M. Starc continues round the wicket short at Malan. He\u2019s resisted hooking so far in this knock, and long may it continue. Fends two through slip, one down near Bancroft under the lid. There\u2019s a short leg, a leg slip, a deep square leg, and a long leg. Two catching short and two catching deep. Good bouncer from Starc. Right over the shoulder. Flinch-worthy and a nasty angle in towards the batsman. Torrid stuff. Finally Malan fends along the ground to square leg, and gets off strike, but he\u2019s faced five balls of the over. Should I be involved in the throwing of shade? Can\u2019t help it, this was good. I won\u2019t tag the accounts involved, but I got one of that well-known genus of tweets blaming T20s for England\u2019s current predicament. Too much money in the game, sack everyone and start again, that kind of constructive approach. Replies Reza Rasool, with an audible grin, \u201cremember before T20 $$ when England kept winning the ashes in 90s and early 00s\u201d. A few minutes later, the original message had been deleted. 27th over: England 76-3 (Cook 36, Malan 11) Lyon to Malan. Again that positive footwork, driving to mid-off who is set well back. Cummins throws at the stumps on the tight single, but they\u2019re through. Two slips again for Cook. He blocks his way through to drinks. It... could be worse? 26th over: England 75-3 (Cook 36, Malan 10) Starc with the short-ball attack. Just outside off, then one just missing the gloves down Malan\u2019s leg side. Fuller and it\u2019s defended. Chris Rogers on the radio wants the batsmen to stick fat. \u201cYou can\u2019t bowl like this forever, can you. It wears the bowler out faster.\u201d Starc\u2019s around the wicket to the left-handed Malan, left-arm bowler trying to cramp him up. Malan jabs a single through square leg to escape the examination. Cook, back over the wicket. Three slips, gully, point, cover is open, mid off, mid on, square leg, deep fine. Hit on the pad from the one ball he faces, but it\u2019s outside the line and off an inside edge. Hold the faith, friends. Hold the faith. 25th over: England 74-3 (Cook 36, Malan 9) Cook watchful against Lyon. On the back dog, pushing square. Two slips in for him, and a short cover. They want him driving, and he obliges, but straight at the close man. Meanwhile, under a Bodhi tree... 24th over: England 74-3 (Cook 36, Malan 9) Dawid, what are you doing? Go home. Don\u2019t you like your home? Malan jabs a ball to leg slip and just takes off. Immediately. Bancroft is right there, picks it up, and actually could have run out Malan before he\u2019d even turned around to regain his ground. Did Cook give him the sense there was a run there? Malan started, stuttered, kept going, then finally did the spin. He would have been metres out had Bancroft hit, but the fieldsman was too keen to get the throw away. Scrubbed it badly. The batsmen trade singles thereafter. Starc continues with the short-ball approach, left-arm over, relentlessly pushing Malan back. Alistair Gillett asks, \u201cDon\u2019t know if you are hearing Ch 9 audio, but Michael Clarke is banging on about how the batting conditions are wonderful and \u2018the best England are likely to see in this Test\u2019. Your thoughts?\u201d Well, Clarke has batted a lot more at Adelaide than me - averages 96 at this ground. I\u2019d say his probably right. The pitch will have settled a bit, and as discussed further down the page, the drop-in style holds together. 23rd over: England 72-3 (Cook 35, Malan 8) Thanks to PDR for the company. On this showing, the former option doesn\u2019t look impossible. Cook goes back on his stumps and cuts gorgously for four. Lyon gave him the length, and Cook split the field with precision. 22nd over: England 67-3 (Cook 31, Malan 7) Mitchell Starc is back. Windmilling his arms, doing the aeroplane, wonder if we\u2019ll see the horsey next? Bowling a good length to Malan who defends into the gully on the bounce. Khawaja picks it up. Not... the most natural gully fieldsman, he doesn\u2019t really get must distance off the ground when the ball flies by. The DRS review comes and goes, and again it\u2019s hit him fairly high, but again the tracking shows more bounce than you would have expected from that ball. Those who invented the technology defend it strongly, but there are still questions to my mind. So many balls have kept low on this pitch, and have barely made it through to the keeper or slips, so quite how they\u2019re doing the Fosbury Flop over the bails, I don\u2019t know. Malan ends the over with a glanced run. Malan is struck... by Starc in front of the stumps. On the back leg. Umpire Aleem Dar takes an eternity to raise the finger, but eventually does. Like yesterday, in a relief for England, the bounce shows it to be going over on ball-tracking. 21st over: England 66-3 (Cook 31, Malan 6) Oh, an edge there from Cook. Lyon beats him that time, but concedes a couple of runs in the process. Cook turns another run through square leg, Malan advances and drives a single to mid-off. Simon Katich on ABC Grandstand is very complimentary of Malan. \u201cHe\u2019s asking a few more questions of Lyon than he did in Brisbane.\u201d 20th over: England 62-3 (Cook 28, Malan 5) Jaffa from Cummins. Round the wicket to Cook, jagged that off the pitch as Cook pushed at it. Lovely stuff. Cook defends the rest of the over, bar a single from the last. 19th over: England 61-3 (Cook 27, Malan 5) Here\u2019s the expected. Two left-handers at the crease, so Nathan \u2018Nathan\u2019 Lyon comes on to turn the ball away from their edges. He\u2019s had Cook a few times before, and got Malan in Brisbane. He\u2019s working on the latter now. A few nervy strokes, but Malan trying to be positive in his movements. The last ball of the over is a bit flat and wide, and Malan carves the cut shot for four. 18th over: England 57-3 (Cook 27, Malan 1) Cummins to Cook, who pulls that for four! Got the ball down, and the bounce then fooled the substitute fieldsman at square leg, some local lad who will be identified in due course, who feels a bit silly as he pulls his temporary baggy green cap over his eyes and runs after the ball. \u201cIf only beat poets were given column inches alongside Vic and Adam and Ali,\u201d muses Daniel McDonald, sending the following. Howl (of the English Tail) I saw the best bowlers of my generation destroyed by bouncers, ducking hysterical afraid, dragging themselves through the Adelaide streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, helmet-headed tailenders burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night, who poverty and sledging and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of Adelaide Oval floating across the tops of churches contemplating Ben Folds\u2026 17th over: England 53-3 (Cook 23, Malan 1) Cook just needs a partner. He finds a calm couple of singles from Hazlewood, while Malan\u2019s run comes from a mistimed pull shot that pops up in the air. Oh dear. Britain! We have a man behind enemy lines. We\u2019ll never reveal his name. LOL jokes, he\u2019s Garry Sharp, go and tail his car. \u201cHave been amused by the #BEATEngland signs everywhere. I thought this sleepy little country town would be swamped and gagged by hordes of drunken cricket fans, but in fact its watering facilities have effortlessly expanded to cope. Pubs have bloated themselves by taking over road space and pop ups have...popped up. But boy did the atmosphere change in the couple of days before the circus arrived, all sorts of energy. Relatively, I mean. Relaxed warmth and good humour everywhere though.\u201d \u201cWent to the Oval yesterday; masses of empty seats and so many crowds in the concession areas. Food didn\u2019t go much beyond burger level though. But let\u2019s concede that yesterday was a dull, grinding day, fruitless and frustrating for England fans and a kind of monotone for the Australians. Started the day feeling nervous and ended it feeling a bit fed up!\u201d \u201cI have to work today, evidenced by my reading OBO and sending you this. The TV might just go on though, or I might just wander down to the Oval later if the demands of my London colleagues with their stupid hours (why can\u2019t they work 1030pm to 8am?)\u201d Nice, Garry. Hope this isn\u2019t too dull for you. 16th over: England 50-3 (Cook 21, Malan 0) Real trouble here, real trouble for Ye Olde Darte. Malan nearly follows suit, but his edge bounces into the cordon. You have to really smash one to get it to carry, here. This on the same pitch that apparently had LBWs soaring over the stumps, according to the computer. Hmm. Root had brought up his team\u2019s 50 just before getting out, with a controlled punch off the back foot. But there was nothing controlled about his dismissal. Cue Fazeer Mohammed audio: \u201cWhy did he do that?\u201d Cummins bowls a bit fuller and fast, Root drops his knees to aim a huge cover drive at the width, and the length was just a touch too far back for that shot. Was basically driving on the up while sinking to one knee like the cover drives of old. Big edge zoomed to first slip, but part-time keeper Bancroft was up to it. 15th over: England 46-2 (Cook 21, Root 5) Oh, yes. Good over. Good contest. Hazlewood versus Cook for the whole six balls. Beats him once with a jaffa. Cook has the calm to handle it. Defends a couple well, a couple in less controlled fashion. Hazlewood right on the dime this morning. 14th over: England 46-2 (Cook 21, Root 5) In Shawshank terms, Cook is the man to tunnel England to freedom over the course of 25 years after they were unjustly imprisoned by their captain\u2019s decision to bowl. Cummins is aiming at the stumps, looking for that Root lbw, but the baby skipper is able to tuck a couple of runs away, then a three. Cook leaves a wildly wide short ball then tucks a single. Runs on this pitch if you play properly. I suspect it\u2019ll actually be at its best for batting today and tomorrow. The drop-in doesn\u2019t really break up at all, unlike Adelaide wickets of yore. This is the England I\u2019m here for. 13th over: England 40-2 (Cook 20, Root 0) Cheer up, you geese. Cook is looking very good. Flicks Hazlewood through midwicket for two, defends a couple artfully, then drives two more through cover with perfect economy of effort. Leaves a good line just outside off, then plays a controlled hook shot for a couple more. \u201cNo!\u201d blurts out someone instinctively - was that Simon Wilde? But it\u2019s ok, Cook didn\u2019t try to smash that, just placed it through square for two more. A profitable over with no alarms and no surprises. 12th over: England 34-2 (Cook 14, Root 0) Poor most of our readers. (Hello, happy Australians.) \u201cHi Geoff, I\u2019m currently writing a novel while staying in an isolated and haunted Irish cottage set in the woods. There\u2019s no WiFi and only one bar of 3G. It\u2019s terrifying. Sometimes it takes two whole minutes to refresh the OBO.\u201d A writer named King in a spooky cabin in the woods... could it be? Cummins continues. Cook looks alright, works a couple and then a single. Cummins nearly sneaks through Root with a leg-stump fast one. 11th over: England 31-2 (Cook 11, Root 0) I\u2019m sorry, Frank, but we\u2019re now too late for this joke. Instead we\u2019ve got the adventures of Cook Root, a... short-order chef who specialises in sweet potatoes? Oh dear. \u201cNot quite the cliched Vince dismissal, but just about,\u201d says Collins next to me. Then he says some less printable things. Good delivery from Hazlewood, back of a length and bouncing high, but Vince could have just left that. Instead he fenced at it, off the back foot, a nothing forcing stroke, and nicked it off. Second over of the day. What doing. 10th over: England 29-1 (Cook 11, Vince 0) A slightly creaky start for Cummins, who is only in the mid 130s, or whatever that is in miles. Accurate though, it\u2019s a maiden. We\u2019re about to get underway. Get excited about Adelaide. Here\u2019s the traditional opening Adelaide OBO tune, feat. Young Farnsy. In matters loftier than a mere Test match between these nations, this morning also saw the unveiling of a statue of Clem Hill, one of the finest batsmen of his or any generation. This also marks the final statue in a series of bronze figures erected around the Adelaide Oval. Jason Gillespie, George Giffen, and Darren Lehmann are the cricketers among another four Australian Rules footballers. Clem was a left-hander, a dashing player, and a strong influence on the early Ashes rivalry. Won a couple of Tests off his own bat, and is fondly remembered for being possibly the only player to whack a selector, though many have wanted to. Here he is. Oh, Ben Mimmack. Someone get that man a hug. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to this session. For some reason, while I find it almost physically painful to watch England toil in the field as the opposition pile up an unattainable total, I can watch an England batting collapse with a sort of self-loathing delight. So either way, this first session should see me off to bed happy. Ah who am I kidding, I\u2019m going to hate this aren\u2019t I?\u201d In come two calls for a bright perspective. Joseph Hunt \u201cJust landed in a wet and drizzly Melbourne after two days of the Test in Adelaide. The Oval is just smashing all round even if the only beer on offer is weak and disgusting. The only consolation to take as a Pom in Aus is that this sort of bleak experience makes the seemingly distant future victories all the sweeter. If you could keep me perked up today with relentless and misguided optimism that would be awesome.\u201d That is exactly what I\u2019m here for. England to win by three innings and 40 runs. And five wickets. Wearing sequins. Peter Lagoe, meanwhile, is twanging a chord in my heart. \u201cBuenos dias!\u201d He begins. \u201cIt sounds like you are lonely with most of Britain\u2019s OBO fans asleep. I am a ex-pat from the UK retired in a small town in Mexico called Zihuatanejo: think Shawshank Redemption. Avid follower of the Guardian cricket reporting. As you can imagine their is little chance of any live cricket here in Mexico. Keep up the good work: battle on England. all is not lost. Yet!\u201d Ah, Zihuatanejo. Final location of Andy Dufresne. Where Red goes to join him on the beach after all those years. \u201cI hope I make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope.\u201d Damn what a film. I read the book when I was 11 and fell in love with Stephen King, a far more subtle writer at times than he\u2019s often given credit for. Brilliant novella, brilliant adaptation. In the meantime, if you want to know a bit more about the enigmatic Shaun Marsh, you\u2019d best find it from Adam Collins rather than him. Shaun took a vow of silence in 1996. \u201cCould your Australian correspondents explain why they get so worked up about English sledging?\u201d enquires Ian Forth. (I doubt they could.) \u201cIt reminds me of Atherton\u2019s response when he refused to walk after a massive nick to Healy who, predictably, gave him a monumental earful: \u2018When in Rome\u2019.\u201d On the other side of the fence, John Phaceas says \u201cJust to start things in cheery way, I will be cutting out and framing today\u2019s story in The West Australian newspaper about the career rebirth of Shaun Marsh, mainly for its description of serial big mouth James Anderson.\u201d \u201chelp, i\u2019m in london,\u201d writes Gil Southwood, which would indeed be cause for requesting aid. But wait, there\u2019s more. \u201cfinishing up a presentation on important gender economists. i\u2019m giving said presentation in 8 hours.\u201d Gil is under such strain that capital letters have gone by the wayside. \u201cI\u2019ve known about this assignment for two months. when did i start it? three hours ago.\u201d I thought we were back in capital land, but that one must have been automatic. \u201conly your OBO can save me. praying for an england collapse, the follow on and then a glorious australian victory to take me into the week. we\u2019ll see. all the best, from a struggling economics finalist\u201d. It\u2019s funny how Gil has adopted the exact work ethic behind my success as a writer. I shall be charging 60p for my pamphlet, The Seven Self-Directed Lies of Highly Successful Procrastinators. Hope none of Gil\u2019s teachers like cricket. Adelaide! The city with a river in it! Also some places of worship. History happened here, with people doing things in the past. They built some buildings out of rocks, and now those have people working in them. It\u2019s unlike any other place in the world. Oh, there are parks. Places with grass where you can sit down. Maybe not today, it\u2019s a bit cold. But in theory... the sky\u2019s the limit.* Let\u2019s hear Adelaide\u2019s national anthem, by this American man. *The sky is a ground-based observation of a permeable layer of gases and infinite space, and as such has no distinct start or finish, meaning it can\u2019t in fact be determined as any kind of barrier or \u2018limit\u2019. If you want more detail of yesterday\u2019s play than my potted summary, let\u2019s ask the man whose job it is to give you one. Step forward, Victor. I know it\u2019s late in the UK, and you\u2019re sensibly in bed, and things aren\u2019t that promising for England. But come on. Spirit of the Blitz and all that. The OBO is nothing without you, a mere shell of a live-update reel. Add me on Twitter at @GeoffLemonSport, or email geoff.lemon@theguardian.com. Play will start half an hour early this morning, due to the rain last night. Wasn\u2019t that a handy shower for England fans. Spared England batting through most of the final session, when the ball is at its most dangerous and hardest to see. It\u2019s an interesting tactical point in day-night cricket that you\u2019ll always see teams dawdle through the first two sessions, because they want as many overs in the evening as possible to bowl the others out. But then that can backfire if you do bowl them out and end up batting yourself. Ah, the intricacies. So, where are we at? England will resume this morning one wicket down and about 400 runs behind. You are settling in to join me for the inevitable Alastair Cook double-century that will come today - in fact, by the time the blog changes hands after three and a half hours of play, he\u2019ll be on about 62 not out. So get ready, it\u2019s going to be a treat. Australia got their lead yesterday thanks to Shaun Marsh\u2019s hundred, which really was an excellent show of patience and control, plus some excellent lower-order sensibleness from Patrick Cummins, then some fun times from Nathan \u2018Nathan\u2019 Lyon. England aren\u2019t out of this yet, but could be very quickly if wickets tumble. I would throw in a 1D clip about lighting up my world, but even I\u2019m not that cruel third post on an OBO. Good morning, evening, or afternoon. Welcome back to Adelaide in electronic form, as we send bits of energy whirling up and down a network of wires that envelop the world in a peculiar embrace. Yes, I know how computers work. Of course. Like when you clap so that Tinkerbell doesn\u2019t die or whatever it is. Get up, Tinkerbell. We can\u2019t live with the guilt. It\u2019s another cool and cloudy day here in the South Australian capital, which will please those bowling. Not the sort of cloud that looks thick and muggy and dangerous, just that the Australians will be able to run in without overly exerting themselves. Which isn\u2019t ideal for England, nor is visibility ideal without the sunshine that makes the pink ball light up. Geoff will be along shortly. Meanwhile, read about how Ben Stokes got on in his club game in New Zealand. Ringed by pine trees and oaks, Mainpower Oval, 30 minutes outside Christchurch, gradually filled with spectators as 11am approached on Sunday. Lord\u2019s it wasn\u2019t, but at least we had Lorde\u2019s Melodrama blaring out across the sleepy pitch. \u201cWatch me disapear,\u201d she sung on Liability, as Stokes, cap firmly settled backwards, batted in the worn nets. \u201cWatch me disappear into the sun.\u201d"
"29||The moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the Republican PartyThe parallels between the Republican Party positions on taxes and climate change are striking. Both are morally appalling and reject the available evidence and expert opinion. The Initiative on Global Markets\u2019 panel of economic experts was recently asked about the Republican tax plan. Among the experts who took a position either way, there was a 96% consensus that the plan would not substantially grow the economy more than the status quo, and a 100% consensus that it would substantially increase the national debt. Those numbers are quite similar to the 97% consensus among climate scientists that humans are driving global warming and the 95% consensus among economists that the US should cut its carbon pollution. The House and Senate Republicans have passed similar versions of their tax bill, and neither chamber is allowing any climate policy to move forward. So what\u2019s making Republican Party leaders reject the expert consensus on these incredibly important issues? Unwavering faith in the face of contradictory facts Sometimes tax cuts make sense; for example, when trying to stimulate a depressed economy, or when operating with a budget surplus. Neither is currently the case. This message from the president: Is incompatible with Senator Lindsey Graham saying \u201cthe economy needs a tax cut.\u201d The tax cut plan, which by design will increase the US national debt by $1.5tn, is also incompatible with Republican opposition to increased deficits. Just last year the Republican National Committee was warning of \u201can unsustainable path toward crippling debt.\u201d Economists also agree that we should be paying down the debt when the economy is going strong. When the next recession inevitably strikes, governments need monetary flexibility to respond. That\u2019s when it makes sense to run a deficit (for example, see the 2009 stimulus package, which helped pull the US out of the Great Recession and cost less than the Republican tax plan). These Republican economic contradictions make no sense, but they\u2019re familiar to those of us who follow climate change news. The only consistency in climate denial is in its contradictions \u2013 deniers claim global warming isn\u2019t happening, but it\u2019s a natural ocean cycle, and caused by the sun, and galactic cosmic rays, and Jupiter\u2019s orbital cycles, and it\u2019s really just a Chinese hoax, and in any case it\u2019s not bad. On taxes, the Republican argument is that cuts pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth and creating jobs. But the economic literature is far from clear about whether tax cuts necessarily spur economic growth at all, let alone enough to pay for themselves. Moreover, corporate CEOs have repeatedly said that the Republican tax plan won\u2019t spur investment or job creation \u2013 instead they\u2019ll mostly pass the gains to their wealthy shareholders. There was an embarrassing video clip when Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn was confronted with this inconvenient truth: When presented with the nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation analysis concluding the bill would increase the national debt by over $1tn even when accounting for associated economic growth, Republicans immediately rejected the results. As Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said, \u201cEither it\u2019s a religious belief, a belief where no amount of evidence would change that, or they are using the argument cynically and they just want more money for themselves.\u201d He was talking about trickle-down economics, but just as easily could have been describing climate denial. A growing disdain for nerds I\u2019m old enough to remember when the GOP considered itself the party of intellectuals, back in the days when Republicans invented the concept of pollution cap and trade systems, for example. It wasn\u2019t long ago that party leaders like Newt Gingrich and 2008 GOP presidential candidate John McCain were calling for the party to support climate policies. Starting with the brief rise of the Tea Party in 2010, that all changed, and the intellectual rot of the GOP has accelerated under President Trump. In a July 2017 Pew poll, just 36% of Republicans said colleges and universities have a positive impact on America, and a stunning 58% said they have a negative effect. Similarly, in an August 2017 Gallup poll, just 33% of Republicans expressed confidence in higher education. Worst of all, the Republican tax bill even penalizes American graduate students. Eating away at the GOP intellectual core: Fox News A 2012 survey found that Americans who only watch Fox News are less informed than Americans who watch no news at all. At the time, 55% of Americans including 75% of Republicans reported watching Fox News. The network is powerful \u2013 a recent study found that Fox News might have enough influence to tip American elections \u2013 and on the whole it prioritizes ideological messaging over factual accuracy. Trump\u2019s attacks on the so-called \u201cfake news\u201d media have further eroded Republicans\u2019 trust of news sources that lack a conservative bias. As David Roberts wrote for Vox: The US is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, a split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know \u2014 what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening \u2026 the right has created its own parallel set of institutions, most notably its own media ecosystem \u2026 \u201cconservative media is more partisan and more insular than the left.\u201d Truth papered over by lies Because so many conservatives rely on right-wing media sources for their news, it\u2019s easy to misinform them through a constant stream of lies. For example, Trump\u2019s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin promised that his department would produce an analysis showing that the tax cuts will pay for themselves. One economist in the department leaked to the New York Times that such an analysis doesn\u2019t exist and Treasury staffers weren\u2019t even asked to study the issue. It was a lie. Mnuchin also claimed the plan would only raise taxes on Americans who earn more than $1 million a year \u2013 the exact opposite of reality and another blatant lie. In fact, the entire Republican case for their tax plan was based on lies. Similarly, climate denial is based on endless myths and misinformation \u2013 Skeptical Science has catalogued and debunked about 200 of them. And recent research showed that these myths are quite effective at misinforming their audience. Republicans including Trump cited a list of 137 economists supporting tax reform, but further investigation showed the list is full of ghosts, office assistants, Koch employees, and many others who failed to mention they\u2019re retired. The climate change equivalent is the Oregon Petition, whose signatories included Spice Girls and fictional characters among its fake experts. Money and power \u2013 the root of all evil The Republican tax plan and the party\u2019s obstruction of climate policies are nevertheless both unpopular positions. Just 25% of Americans support the tax plan, though that includes 60% of Republican voters. Similarly, 80% of Americans - including 62% of Trump voters - agree that the US should regulate and/or tax carbon pollution. But public support often doesn\u2019t translate into policy, and Republican policymakers have been surprisingly honest and forthright about why they support the tax plan despite opposition by a majority of voters and economic experts: The plan also raises taxes soonest and most on poorer Americans, slashes their health care coverage, and Republicans are already planning to pay for the plan by cutting social programs that low-income Americans rely on. While massive income inequality is one of the biggest problems in America, squashing the \u2018American dream,\u2019 Republicans voted to make the problem much worse. Similarly, poorer countries are the most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. The Republican Party motto may as well be \u2018benefits for the rich at the expense of the poor.\u2019 Quite simply, Republican politicians need campaign donations from oil companies and other big corporations to win elections. To maintain their power they must keep the cash flowing. That means keeping rich donors happy by cutting corporate taxes and obstructing climate policies. To achieve that, Republican politicians reject scientific evidence and expert opinion, lie to their voters, and rely on right-wing media echo chamber propaganda and tribalism to keep their supporters voting against their own best interests. It\u2019s all morally reprehensible, and so far, it\u2019s working. At this point, the only way to fix the problem is to defeat the Republicans who have rotted their party to its core and are now spreading that rot throughout America and the rest of the world."
"11||The top 100 tracks of 2017Many listeners are still in love with the album: a piece of work that allows a musician to fully sketch out their current worldview. And we\u2019ll be counting down our favourite 50 albums of the year over the next three weeks. But others have made a decisive shift away from albums and towards playlists on streaming services \u2013 often curated by Spotify or Apple themselves. We explored the phenomenon here \u2013 as well as how albums are mutating in response \u2013 and started our own monthly playlist. Now, after culling votes from more than 50 Guardian writers and critics, we\u2019ve collated our top 100 tracks of the year in a single giant playlist, featuring everything from rap to pop, vocal jazz and shoegaze. Use the widget below to subscribe to it in either Spotify or Apple Music \u2013 it\u2019s been sequenced so that it runs smoothly from style to style, rather than in order of popularity. The actual top 10, ranked after we collated all of our critics\u2019 votes, is below. You may have your own particular beef to air with the selection \u2013 personally I\u2019m outraged that Migos\u2019s Get Right Witcha is in there but T-Shirt isn\u2019t \u2013 so comment below with songs you think have been overlooked. 10. Paramore \u2013 Hard Times Paramore\u2019s passage from tortured emo teens to tortured soft-rock grownups continued with this irrepressible single from their album After Laughter. The gulf between the perkiness of the backing and the torpor of the lyrics is impressively vast \u2013 Hayley Williams sings of emotional cruelty and breakdown over Chic-style guitar licks. 9. Drake \u2013 Passionfruit Adding to Drake\u2019s growing canon of anti-commitment R&amp;B jams was this lithe, nimble number powered by beautifully melancholy production by Londoner Nana Rogues (and a nice cameo from house legend Moodymann). It was also a great illustration of the democracy of the streaming age \u2013 after his More Life album (OK, \u201cplaylist\u201d) dropped on to Spotify, it was Passionfruit that was sent up the singles charts by the public\u2019s sheer love for it. 8. Stormzy \u2013 Big for Your Boots After wooing the entire nation\u2019s youth, Stormzy\u2019s debut album was hugely anticipated and discussed. Would he dilute his scornful flow and go for poppy choruses? Lead-off single Big for Your Boots showed that he didn\u2019t need to do either: he was as withering as ever, and the quotable bars and musicality of his delivery meant that big top lines weren\u2019t even needed. 7. The Horrors \u2013 Something to Remember Me By The year\u2019s best breakup song seemed to blend every bit of a failed relationship: the regret, the resignation and, in the Ibiza-level backing, the raging bacchanalia. Lesser bands would have produced it in a much more basic, immediate way, but the Horrors \u2013 aided by Paul Epworth \u2013 folded it into a psychedelic, whirling world of multitracked synths. 6. Perfume Genius \u2013 Slip Away Mike Hadreas gets more ambitious, robust and clear-headed with every album, and Slip Away is gigantic \u2013 the chorus arrives like a wrecking ball, with stabbing bass and crashing cymbals leaving sonic mess everywhere. But the melody twirls through it unperturbed, creating a huge pop statement \u2013 and a rough-edged sibling to our number one pick. 5. Future \u2013 Mask Off That Mask Off pairs a sample from Selma, a musical about Martin Luther King, with a lyric that celebrates drug use, gun violence and bland materialism, arguably highlights the moral gulf at the heart of rap in 2017. But Future\u2019s track is also intensely beautiful in its very emptiness, the sound of someone endlessly chasing thrills without knowing why. 4. Selena Gomez \u2013 Bad Liar With just a few fingerclicks and drums, and the bassline from Talking Heads\u2019 Psycho Killer strutting beneath her, Selena Gomez rejects the maximalism of so much modern pop. Just as David Byrne used the bassline\u2019s tripping gait to suggest dangerously unpredictability, Gomez is similarly troubled, unable to duck her romantic feelings. Idiosyncratic and fresh, it earned 200m views on YouTube. 3. Kendrick Lamar \u2013 HUMBLE. Kendrick trades on his generally agreed-upon \u201cgreatest alive\u201d status by boasting about money, expensive booze and getting paged by Obama. But even amid what is essentially a track about how great he is, he still finds space for a little social commentary, rejecting Photoshop in favour of \u201csomething natural like ass with some stretch marks\u201d. 2. Charli XCX \u2013 Boys With its witty video that reclaimed objectification for a hipster female gaze, salivating over diverse internet-famous cuties with Charli herself in the director\u2019s chair, Boys is a modest and perfectly written pop classic. Every element, from the Mario coin sound to the resolution after the middle eight, is a songwriting bullseye. 1. Lorde \u2013 Green Light With this barnstorming anthem dispelling any remnants of her one-hit-wonder reputation, Lorde showed again that she is as adept at savage detail (\u201cShe thinks you love the beach, you\u2019re such a damn liar\u201d) as she is at the unifying power of a simple chorus. The desperation for a \u201cgreen light\u201d that will let her speed off from heartbreak is horribly, powerfully tangible in her utterly unselfconscious delivery. She\u2019s a star who can do one of the most valuable things in pop \u2013 articulate and clarify the feelings of millions \u2013 and the most exciting thing is that, as she is 21, there is likely so much more of it to come."

"29||Co-op to sell food past its 'best before' date in bid to cut wasteA major retailer has become the first to start selling food that is past its \u201cbest before\u201d date in a drive to reduce food waste. From this week, the East of England Co-op \u2013 the biggest independent retailer in East Anglia \u2013 will sell tinned goods and dried food such as pasta, crisps and rice for a nominal 10p once they reach their best-before date. The offer will not apply to fresh and perishable foods, however, which carry a \u201cuse by\u201d date indicating when a product is safe to eat. The move by the retailer, which is independent of the Co-operative Group, follows a three-month trial in 14 stores that found that the 10p items generally sold within hours of being reduced. Despite concerted efforts to reduce food waste through the entire supply chain, the government\u2019s waste advisory body, Wrap, says \u00a313bn-worth of edible food is thrown out in Britain every year. Wrap is overseeing a major simplification of labelling with consumers often unaware of the difference between a use-by and a best-before date. The East of England Co-op hopes to save at least two tonnes of food from being wasted annually with the initiative. As part of the Co-op Guide to Dating campaign, shoppers will be told \u201cDon\u2019t be a binner, have it for dinner!\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to get dumped\u201d. \u201cWe are committed to reducing waste in our business and the Co-op Guide to Dating is one of many initiatives we have instigated to make the East of England Co-op as efficient as possible, reducing our impact on the environment,\u201d said Roger Grosvenor, the company\u2019s joint chief executive and head of its retail division. \u201cDuring our trial we found our 10p items went within hours of being reduced, sometimes quicker,\u201d said Grosvenor. \u201cThe vast majority of our customers understand they are fine to eat and appreciate the opportunity to make a significant saving on some of their favourite products. This is not a money-making exercise, but a sensible move to reduce food waste and keep edible food in the food chain. By selling perfectly edible food we can save 50,000-plus items every year which would otherwise have gone to waste.\u201d The Food Standards Agency advises that products past their best-before date are safe to eat but may not be at the optimum quality intended by the producer. The products will remain on sale for a month past their best-before date. The East of England Co-op has also launched a new \u201creduced to clear\u201d policy, offering bigger discounts earlier in the day on foods nearing their use-by dates. The 10p discounted food cannot be donated to charities such as food banks as they do not accept items past their best-before dates."
"8||Ireland: no go-ahead for Brexit talks to move onThe Irish government is not immediately ready to approve Brexit talks moving on to the next phase although progress has been made, an Irish minister said at the start of a crucial day for the negotiation process. Helen McEntee, Ireland\u2019s Europe minister, said a \u201chuge amount of work\u201d had been done over the weekend to try to iron out proposals for a future Irish border, one of the issues that must be addressed before Brexit talks can move on to discussing a future trade relationship. The Irish cabinet was meeting on Monday morning before Theresa May\u2019s crunch meeting at lunchtime in Brussels with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. \u201cUnfortunately I don\u2019t think that we will have an absolute final text that we will be able to approve,\u201d McEntee told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cHowever, for us there are a number of key issues that we have wanted to see progress on that I know progress has been made over the weekend.\u201d May will be joined by David Davis, the Brexit secretary, in Brussels. Speaking before he departed, Davis told the BBC that it was \u201can important day\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve put seven months of work, both sides, into getting to this point, and we\u2019re hoping that Mr Juncker, today, will give us sufficient progress so we can move on to trade talks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decision, of course, won\u2019t be taken until 15 December, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping for. Trade talks are of enormous importance in the United Kingdom and Europe.\u201d Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said a deal on the Irish border was still achievable. He confirmed no deal had been struck on how to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland but said talks were at a \u201csensitive\u201d stage and there was still time for an agreement. \u201cWe are not quite yet where we want to be, but it is possible to do that [agree] today,\u201d he told Morning Ireland on RTE national radio. He added: \u201cThe Irish government has to remain firm on the key issues.\u201d Coveney told RTE that the special Irish cabinet meeting called on Monday morning would discuss a draft proposal from May. He said: \u201cA text has been looked at by our negotiating teams and the EU taskforce negotiating teams.\u201d He said a draft proposal had been achieved last Thursday but there had not been agreement by Ireland on all issues and, despite conversations continuing until late on Sunday night, there was still an impasse over some unspecified aspects. The Brexit focus on Monday will be split between Dublin and Brussels. The Irish cabinet met on Monday morning but no statement was expected until further last-minute talks with British negotiators. Meanwhile, May will have lunch with Juncker and then see the European council president, Donald Tusk, before returning to London. If there is progress, the UK and EU could issue a joint statement on Monday afternoon, with May expected to update MPs on Tuesday. May will be delivering the UK\u2019s final offer on the three main issues in the first round of Brexit talks \u2013 citizens\u2019 rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border, with the latter proving the most intractable. She had been given a deadline of Monday 4 December to table offers before a European council summit on 14 December, when EU leaders would decide if \u201csufficient progress\u201d had been made to proceed to the next phase of talks, on a future trading relationship. Asked what else Ireland was seeking as reassurance that a hard border could be avoided after Brexit, McEntee said more work was needed from the UK. \u201cMy belief \u2013 and I think we would all agree in the government in Ireland \u2013 is we need to have something that is much clearer than we\u2019ve had to date,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat has been very welcome is to have that commitment that there can be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland. \u201cHowever, we have always said in order for that to happen there cannot be any divergence in the regulatory framework.\u201d Asked if she was seeking the impossible from the UK, McEntee said all the Irish government was asking for was \u201cfor the UK government to fulfil their commitment\u201d to no hard border as set out in May\u2019s Florence speech. McEntee said it was \u201cnot just a customs issue\u201d, but also had to be tackled to avoid any future unrest. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a return to something of the past where there were huge troubles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not want anything that would trigger any kind of a return to the difficulties of the past.\u201d Asked whether she was optimistic, McEntee said: \u201cI do believe that we are nearing closer progress, and sufficient progress. We are not there yet. That is why we are meeting as a cabinet this morning to look at where we are, to assess where we are, to look at what is being presented and to see what we need to do to move forwards. \u201cIf there is not enough that has been given to us yet, it is up to the UK government to produce that, to provide that.\u201d Owen Paterson, one of a quartet of senior Conservative hardliners on Brexit who set out a series of \u201cred lines\u201d for May at the weekend, warned that he would accept \u201cno special arrangements\u201d for the Irish border. Paterson, who was formerly Northern Ireland secretary, told Today: \u201cIt would be disastrous for the Belfast agreement to put a line down the Irish Sea and to have Northern Ireland hived off with some separate standards, as some people in the Dublin political establishment are asking for. That would be really very damaging.\u201d He said a \u201csoft\u201d border could be maintained by carrying out customs checks at the point of shipment, with technology tracking goods crossing the frontier."
"13||McDonald's binges and screaming fits: new book reveals Trump's foiblesDonald Trump\u2019s preferred order at McDonald\u2019s has been revealed as a waistband-busting meal containing alarming amounts of fat and salt. During campaign stops at the fast food restaurant the president would ask for two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fishes and a chocolate milkshake, according to an insider\u2019s account of his presidential bid. Trump\u2019s order amounts to 2,420 calories, according to McDonald\u2019s nutritional data. US authorities generally advise men to consume about 2,500 calories per day. His chosen meal also contains 112g of fat, which is 172% of Trump\u2019s recommended daily allowance, as well as 3,470mg of salt \u2013 144% of his recommended daily intake. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, revealed details of the campaign diet in a new book, titled Let Trump Be Trump. The authors said meals aboard the presidential campaign plane were dominated by fast food. \u201cOn Trump Force One there were four major food groups: McDonald\u2019s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, pizza and Diet Coke,\u201d they wrote, according to a copy obtained by the Washington Post. The Post said the book also revealed that the plane had to be stocked with bountiful supplies of cookies and other snacks because \u201cTrump, a renowned germaphobe, would not eat from a previously opened package\u201d. The former campaign officials said Trump was known to scream expletive-laden rants at aides who were left with their \u201cface ripped off\u201d. \u201cThe mode that he switches into when things aren\u2019t going his way can feel like an all-out assault\u201d they write. \u201cIt\u2019d break most hardened men and women into little pieces.\u201d Both authors appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday. Asked if Trump\u2019s rages had ever made him consider leaving the campaign, Lewandowski said: \u201cI never thought about quitting. \u201cBut, you know, when you give up the sacrifice of time with your family and all the things that were important to you and he demands such perfection, and he deserves it.\u201d Lewandowski was fired as Trump\u2019s campaign manager in June 2016."
"25||Ed Sheeran Comic Relief film branded 'poverty porn' by aid watchdog\u201cPoverty porn\u201d appeals fronted by celebrities Ed Sheeran, Tom Hardy and Eddie Redmayne are simply reinforcing white saviour stereotypes, according to an aid watchdog. The three films, made for Comic Relief and the Disasters Emergencies Committee (DEC), which raises cash for 13 major UK aid groups including Save the Children, Oxfam and ActionAid in emergencies, were nominated for \u201cmost offensive\u201d campaigns of 2017 by the Radi-Aid awards. The annual contest, organised by the student-run Norwegian Students and Academics International Assistance Fund (Saih), is aimed at challenging aid groups to shift away from stereotypes about people living in poverty. The criticism followed comments by Liz Warner, the chief executive of Comic Relief, admitting the organisation had lost its creative touch and needed to be \u201cedgy again\u201d. The Sheeran-fronted Comic Relief video, during which the singer offers to pay hotel costs for street children in Liberia, verged on \u201cpoverty tourism\u201d, according to the jury. They described DEC\u2019s Hardy-fronted Yemen appeal, which contains graphic images of unidentified starving and sick children, as \u201cdevoid of dignity\u201d and a throwback to the 1980s, when exploitative pictures of poor people were rife. But it did offer some political context, the jury said, unlike the group\u2019s Africa appeal, featuring Redmayne. The DEC\u2019s Africa video was deemed \u201cpoverty porn and people waiting to be saved\u201d. All were nominated for the Rusty Radiator award. Beathe \u00d8g\u00e5rd, president of the Saih, said the three British films showed local people as victims and was an over-simplistic, outdated way to communicate about development. \u201cWe have been presented with these kind of images since the 1980s,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are horrible to watch. People are so used to them that for many they reinforce that feeling of hopelessness and apathy \u2013 and even a negative view of development in that nothing is going in the right direction.\u201d She acknowledged celebrities bring in donations \u2013 the DEC\u2019s east Africa appeal raised \u00a360m, while the Yemen appeal raised \u00a327m \u2013 but said that they can distort the narrative, particularly when they are uninformed about the issues. \u201cEd Sheeran has good intentions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the problem is the video is focused on Ed Sheeran as the main character. He is portrayed as the only one coming down and being able to help.\u201d \u00d8g\u00e5rd said that in the four years the organisation had run the awards, she had seen more creative appeals, often by small organisations. Among those nominated for best fundraising film, or the Golden Radiator award , is one from War Child Holland, praised by judges as \u201cpowerful and positive\u201d. \u201cIt shows it is possible to play on our emotions without playing on guilt,\u201d \u00d8g\u00e5rd said. \u201cYou see a child using his imagination and playing. It is a refugee in Yemen but could be a child in Norway. It really hits a nerve.\u201d The film features a child in Yemen, laughing and playing with a Batman character. At one point, bombs drop and the family are forced to move, and we see \u201cBatman\u201d morph into the boy\u2019s father. The words \u201cFor some children, fantasy is the only way to escape reality\u201d flash on to the screen. The Radi-Aid awards grew out of a satirical video on aid fundraising in 2012 Radi-Aid: Africa for Norway, which went viral. Jennifer Lentfer, director of Thousand Currents, a San Francisco-based charity supporting grassroots organisations, said she had noticed a return to the use of images of so-called poverty porn among larger NGOs, as public funding is squeezed. \u201cIt is not surprising,\u201d said Lentfer. \u201cPity and shame are easy emotional levers to pull. They are proved to bring in the dollars. It\u2019s a transactional way of looking at viewers and readers, to say, \u2018I just want your money.\u2019\u201d DEC\u2019s Nicola Peckett said: \u201cDEC is not about general poverty in Africa and the developing world. It is specifically for urgent and large-scale humanitarian crises where rapid action and funding are needed. We need to mobilise the public and the response very quickly.\u201d Peckett said the model, where broadcasters film appeals on behalf of DEC, was a successful one, but the nominations had given the organisation food for thought. \u201cWe will discuss it with our broadcast partners when we review our appeals,\u201d she said. Warner, at Comic Relief said its nomination would serve as a \u201cconstant reminder of the need to stay as relevant as possible going forwards and to give a voice to the people affected by the issues we care about\u201d. \u201cIf we do win this award, I would still like to say thank you to the artists whose support means we have reached mass audiences and raised vital funds for life-changing projects in the UK and around the world,\u201d she said. The public poll for the Golden Radiator and Rusty Radiator awards closes on the 4 December and winners will be announced on 7 Dec."

"13||Trump is elephant in the room at Kennedy Center HonorsBetsy DeVos nodded gently to a hip-hop beat. Wilbur Ross sat a few seats away from the Star Wars director JJ Abrams. Steven Mnuchin clapped robotically from a balcony shared with Gloria Estefan and Lionel Richie. The biggest night on Washington\u2019s cultural calendar delivered the usual mix of politicians and celebrities on Sunday but lacked the one person who is both: President Donald Trump. It was the 40th annual Kennedy Center Honors and only the fourth time the president did not attend, following Jimmy Carter in 1979, George Bush in 1989 and Bill Clinton in 1994. Trump\u2019s absence spared organisers the embarrassment of a potential walkout by those receiving awards or political insults being flung at him from the stage. The decision was made in August after Norman Lear, a TV producer and founder of the progressive group People For the American Way, threatened to boycott rather than attend any aspect of the ceremonies involving the divisive president. With other recipients of honors expressing support for Lear\u2019s position, Trump announced that he and the first lady, Melania, would not attend the showpiece. \u201cI think it\u2019s understood why and how it all happened,\u201d said Julie Andrews, the British actor and singer and a member of the special honors advisory committee. \u201cI wasn\u2019t party to the discussions that went on but I do understand that it was to make this evening as viable and successful as possible and I think he and his lovely wife chose to do the right thing.\u201d Even so, there was the spectacle of Trump\u2019s education secretary, DeVos, his treasury secretary, Mnuchin, the commerce secretary, Ross, and the top economic adviser Gary Cohn being confronted with a joyous celebration of America\u2019s cultural and racial diversity with lots of political subtext, though the president was never mentioned by name. The comedian Dave Chappelle, referring to an original copy of the Declaration of Independence bought by Lear and displayed on stage, joked that everything was for sale. \u201cIncluding our founding document, it turns out,\u201d, adding that it would be likely to fetch \u201ca lot of roubles\u201d. \u201d Among the star turns were Meryl Streep, the Oscar-winning actor who has clashed with Trump, and Jon Batiste, the music director of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which ridicules the president and his cabinet on a nightly basis. But neither touched on politics and, whereas Colbert delivered barbs as master of ceremonies last year, this time the programme dispensed with the role of host, perhaps wary that whoever filled the role would find political provocations irresistible. Instead there were cameos by Abrams, Anthony Anderson, Quincy Jones, Queen Latifah, Leona Lewis, Rob Reiner, Kenny Rogers and Stevie Wonder in a spectacle of song, dance, film clips and heartfelt speeches. (Much has changed in a year: the 2016 performers included Kevin Spacey, now in disgrace.) On the red carpet before the black tie event, Lear, producer of All in the Family and other shows pioneering for their exploration of race relations and other social issues, clearly did not feel that Trump\u2019s no-show hurt the event\u2019s prestige. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a hand I needed to shake,\u201d the 95-year-old said. But not all the the recipients of awards were sworn anti-Trumpers. Richie has known the billionaire businessman for about 30 years and played many private concerts at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. \u201cAs far as hangout buddy, no. As an employer, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI love Mar-a-Lago, it\u2019s a great place.\u201d Asked whether he applauded Trump\u2019s absence, the 68-year-old replied: \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to do tonight is not focus on that. I\u2019m going straight for the fact: have you seen this on my neck? [the Kennedy Center rainbow-ribboned medallion] That\u2019s where we\u2019re going, celebrating the arts. Let\u2019s just talk about it: I\u2019m graduating with the class of Norman Lear. Excuse me?!\u201d Fellow singer Gloria Estefan also has a long history with Trump. She launched a 2004 tour from one of his properties and her husband, Emilio, was a judge on many of his Miss Universe contests. \u201cI\u2019m thankful he chose not to come because all it does is overshadow the accomplishments of people that have spent a lifetime trying to something,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it was very thoughtful.\u201d Cuban-born Estefan criticised the president\u2019s decision to restore travel restrictions on the island. \u201cI wish certain things could be improved,\u201d she said of his tenure so far. \u201cLet\u2019s give him some time. Maybe he\u2019ll surprise us.\u201d LL Cool J \u2013 real name James Todd Smith \u2013 became the first hip-hop artist (and at 49, the youngest person) to receive a Kennedy Center honor. He declined to say whether he would have gone to the traditional White House reception. \u201cI think in this environment, right now, the political climate can be a bit distracting and tonight it\u2019s about the arts, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to use this as a soapbox to take shots or try to be divisive. I don\u2019t want to go there. I think it\u2019s about the love, the culture. I want hip-hop to be remembered as a unifying force. We\u2019re coming in here and it\u2019s going to be unity and music and love and art and dance and TV.\u201d In a list striking for its multiculturalism, another recipient of an award was the African-American dancer and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade, 86, who received testimonials from Streep, who was her pupil at Yale University, and the dancer Misty Copeland, who said: \u201cMe, as a black prima ballerina dancing at the Metropolitan Opera House, I stand on your shoulders.\u201d Trump\u2019s allies were reluctant to speak about his absence. DeVos said during the interval: \u201cI think that decision was made months ago. I just happen to be here.\u201d Cohn denied that he was disappointed: \u201cNo. That was his decision.\u201d Senator Rand Paul and Caroline Kennedy, daughter of the former president John F Kennedy, declined to comment. But Senator Jeff Flake, an outspoken critic of Trump, praised the president for his absence: \u201cWell, it sounded like it was the right thing to do, just given what other people have said. So it was probably magnanimous.\u201d Other figures in attendance included the Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Obama White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, the former national security adviser Susan Rice and the British ambassador Kim Darroch. The recipients were also honored on Saturday at a gala state department dinner, hosted by Andrews, where Lear, a white American born in Connecticut, joked: \u201cI\u2019m very proud to be among these honorees representing my race.\u201d The programme will be televised on America\u2019s CBS channel on 26 December. Asked if Trump would be invited next year, Deborah Rutter, president of the Kennedy Center, said: \u201cAbsolutely. We take it one day at a time. It is important to have the president of the United States, to have that individual, as the highest in the land, appreciating and understanding and telling the world how important the arts are.\u201d"
"22||How was your weekend running?Despite being well into December now, I haven\u2019t quite got to grips with my winter running wardrobe. It doesn\u2019t help that the temperature seems to be see-sawing in London - one day frost on the ground, the next you could run in a vest and shorts (well, double Centigrade figures is vest weather in my book). I have an awkward combination of a hatred of too many layers and terrible circulation/ Raynauld\u2019s - which means I end up sporting odd combinations of very lightweight running gear with excessive amounts of peripheral accessories: shorts fine, gloves mandatory. Vest ok, but must wear buff/hat. Last week I even managed to lose feeling in my right ear after forgetting the latter during a cold run. As for the weekend, on Saturday I pootled happily round the local parks, and yesterday took part in the Windmiler club championships - a 5k or 10k race around the paths of Womble territory. No Wombles spotted (nor, of course, any litter dropped for them to have to pick up) but I did come home with silverware. So, over to you - and your top running accessories tips for nippy weather below the line please - I seem to have lost my best gloves and my buffs keep disappearing mysteriously into my eight year old\u2019s wardrobe ..."
"6||Union launches new legal action over blacklisting of buildersThe Unite union is seeking compensation for more than 70 construction workers who were \u201cblacklisted\u201d by some of Britain\u2019s biggest construction firms. The new legal action targets key individuals involved in a shadowy organisation, the Consulting Association, which the construction industry used to monitor more than 3,000 building workers. It comes after about \u00a310m was paid in compensation last year to more than 250 building workers on the blacklist, which is believed to have operated for 30 years. The Consulting Association\u2019s offices were raided by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office after revelations in the Guardian. The new case, involving workers not party to the previous legal action, names four individuals who all held the role of chairman at the Consulting Association: David Cochrane and Cullum McAlpine, previously of Sir Robert McAlpine; Danny O\u2019Sullivan, formerly of Kier; and Stephen Quant, previously of Skanska. Those companies and nine others are listed in the action, which alleges unlawful conspiracy, breach of privacy, defamation and Data Protection Act offences. The Unite assistant general secretary for legal affairs, Howard Beckett, said: \u201cUnite is determined to ensure that the people directly responsible for blacklisting workers and ruining their lives are brought to justice and have to answer for their actions. \u201cSince 2009, the individuals who were the controlling minds behind the systematic blacklisting of workers have sought to avoid taking responsibility for their actions. The workers who had their lives ruined deserve to see the leading blacklisters in court.\u201d It is understood that some of the workers involved in the new case have already been offered compensation, despite the formal closure of the previous compensation scheme. One source told the Guardian that 55 such claims had been \u201cfully settled\u201d. However, those individuals are understood to remain involved in the legal action as issues relating to retraining and apology remain. Sir Robert McAlpine said in a statement that it had a \u201czero-tolerance policy towards blacklisting, illegal or unfair recruitment practices and we expect all our sub-contractors to comply with this\u201d. It said it had also signed up to the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority construction protocol to protect workers from exploitation. \u201cBlacklisting in construction was, until 2009, an industry-wide issue \u2013 most of the largest British construction companies in operation today were involved in the past when there was no legislation in place to outlaw the practice. Sir Robert McAlpine has admitted to, and apologised for, its past involvement and has paid compensation to affected workers,\u201d it said. Only eight companies apologised and paid these financial settlements. Kier and Skanska declined to comment."
"2||The IOC must do its duty this time and ban Russia from Winter OlympicsThis time there is no justifiable room for doubt, nor reason to go wobbly. When the International Olympic Committee meets in Lausanne on Tuesday it must ban Russia from the Winter Games in Pyeongchang. The scale of its sporting crimes is outrageous. The evidence is conclusive. Only the appropriate punishment has so far been lacking. We live in a world where every story seems to be branded as fake news by fools, trolls, and those irreversibly blinded by their prejudices. Yet remarkably, Professor Richard McLaren\u2019s reports into Russian doping, the second of which was published a year ago this week, have not only withstood every smear but have found their truths hardened. McLaren, remember, told us more than 1,000 Russian athletes across more than 30 sports had been involved or benefited from state-sponsored doping between 2011 and 2015. He told us the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi was corrupted by an extraordinary ruse, in which steroid-ridden urine samples from Russian competitors were swapped for clean urine by using small metal rods to prise open supposedly tamper-proof bottles, which were then passed through a tiny hole in the dead of night. And he told us the Russian state, its security services, its sports authorities and anti-doping agency were all in on the grand deception. Even now it sounds almost too outlandish \u2013 an institutionalised conspiracy that John le Carr\u00e9 might have paused before telling \u2013 yet it was all too real. The Russian government has tried to discredit McLaren and his main whistleblower, Grigory Rodchenkov, who ran the Russian Anti-Doping Agency laboratory in Moscow until fleeing last year \u2013 and to cast shades of grey on a black-and-white case, but none of the muck has stuck. Before the Rio Olympics, however, all the evidence was somehow not enough for a conviction. When McLaren published his first report in July 2016, the IOC promised it would not hesitate to take the \u201ctoughest sanctions available\u201d against those implicated, with its president, Thomas Bach, saying there had been \u201ca shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sports and on the Olympic Games\u201d. And what happened? The IOC flinched, coming up with an unholy fudge that passed the buck to the individual sports and led to 278 Russian athletes being waved through to compete in Rio under their nation\u2019s flag. Many insiders had feared a repeat of that shabby trick before Pyeongchang, especially given that Bach \u2013 a good friend of Vladimir Putin \u2013 has been so reluctant to criticise Russia. In the past month, however, there has been a dramatic sea change. It started when the World Anti-Doping Agency revealed that it had received fresh evidence from a whistleblower that Wada said had \u201creinforced\u201d McLaren\u2019s findings. Rodchenkov\u2019s credibility as a witness was further confirmed when the IOC\u2019s Oswald commission said he was telling the truth about the nature of the cover-up when it stripped the Russian cross-country skier Alexander Legkov of his Sochi medals. Legkov is now one of 25 Russians who has been retrospectively banned since the start of November \u2013 a number that is still climbing. Separately, the IOC has also said it believes 2014-dated entries in Rodchenkov\u2019s diary which directly implicate Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister for sport, Vitali Mutko, in a state-run conspiracy, is \u201csignificant\u201d evidence. Mutko, incidentally, remains in charge of the Russia 2018 World Cup despite McLaren finding an email trail showing he gave the order to \u201csave\u201d a banned player who had failed a drugs test. There are also suggestions from McLaren that the whole Russia team for the 2014 World Cup was under \u201cprotection\u201d from the authorities. It was hardly reassuring either that when Fifa\u2019s own ethics committee appointee, Michael Garcia, investigated rumours that bribes were paid to secure the 2018 tournament, the Russian bid committee \u201cmade only a limited number of documents available for review\u201d \u2013 because \u201cthe computers used at the time had been leased and returned to their owner after the bidding process [and then] destroyed\u201d. Fifa has shown little willingness to tackle any of this but there is no reason for the IOC to be so lily-livered. On Tuesday it must make a decision that is both obvious and fair. Ban the Russian team from Pyeongchang but allow those athletes not implicated by the McLaren report, and who have passed sufficient doping tests, to compete under a neutral flag. This solution \u2013 which was adopted by athletics for Rio \u2013 would serve justice and natural justice. Russia would be deprived of sporting glory but its innocent stars would still get to live out their dreams. It would show that a ban is not about vengeance but fair play. There is growing noise within Olympic circles that the IOC is heading in this direction, and that Russia might respond by boycotting the Games. It would be better served by admitting its mistakes \u2013 something it still refuses to do. As Rodchenkov told ESPN: \u201cI wish Tuesday began with a confession and apology from Russia, which would give the world confidence they might embrace truth and reform \u2013 [but] this is not the Russian way. If they are not disciplined seriously, they will be laughing at the IOC behind closed doors and plotting their next caper.\u201d It is hard to disagree. This time there must be no weasel words, no back-room deals, no ugly accommodations. Merely justice that is desperately overdue."
"4||How American women's growing power finally turned #metoo into a cultural momentThe Harvey Weinstein scandal has prompted a flood of accusations and admissions \u2013 but, unlike previous sexual harassment flash points, it has also sparked a moment of national reckoning. Women once silenced by fear are speaking out, and the names of perpetrators keep coming: in recent days, TV hosts Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose were fired, New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush was suspended, and the head of Pixar, John Lasseter, said he would take a six-month sabbatical. The huge number of stories, covering lewd texts to predatory advances to rape, is unparalleled. The power structures that used to protect the harassers are crumbling. Companies are acting more swiftly and punitively than ever before. Anger at men\u2019s behaviour has erupted in the US several times in the past: from the \u201csmash the masher\u201d movement of the early 1900s, where women fought back against street harassers with hatpins and umbrellas, to the feminist \u201cspeak-out\u201d sessions of the 1970s to the support for Anita Hill in the 1990s. But what led to today\u2019s tipping point? While the #metoo campaign played a crucial role, other elements also helped create a tinderbox waiting for a Weinstein-like spark. Estelle Freedman, a history professor at Stanford University, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not technology alone, it\u2019s also about the other contexts. It\u2019s a gradual, accumulative process and then a tipping point.\u201d Among these factors are the election of a president who once bragged about \u201cgrabbing women by the pussy\u201d; the increasing economic and political power of women in recent years; and corporate awareness of the national mood and worries about brand reputation. It is also suggested that because many of the women involved in the Weinstein revelations are famous, powerful and named, their testimonies are more credible and have encouraged others to feel they would also be believed. Freedman says the story of disbelieving women is long and deep. \u201cThis works through culture, in Anglo-American law and in popular culture. \u201cIt\u2019s privileged men who are protected by this mechanism, more than immigrant men or African-American men. They had a long history of privilege, of being able to say: \u2018She\u2019s lying. I didn\u2019t do it\u2019 or \u2018We did it. She consented.\u2019 Those men are losing a long legacy of privilege right now.\u201d Anita Hill, a trailblazer against sexual harassment The #metoo hashtag went viral, as women gave voice to decades of latent anger and resentment. Emily Martin, vice-president for workplace justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center (NWLC), said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly empowering to hear other women expressing what you have experienced and never expressed.\u201d This was the case too in 1991 when Anita Hill testified before a Senate panel that the supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her for years. Her credibility was attacked and Thomas was confirmed. Martin said: \u201cThere was this cultural moment then as well about sexual harassment and whether we believe women. A lot of women felt activated at that moment. The next year women came into Congress in greater numbers than ever before.\u201d The number of complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rose from 6,126 the year before Hill testified to 10,578 the year after, a 73% increase. Back then, women showed their support by wearing \u201cI believe Anita Hill\u201d buttons, now they have a means to show solidarity in an instantly accessible and more far-reaching way with #metoo. Martin said: \u201cThis [Weinstein] moment is different because we have social media which magnifies and amplifies the power of individuals sharing their stories. It allows women to talk to each other and hear each other in a way that makes you feel less isolated and alone, which is the way harassment works. \u201cThe internet can definitely be a harmful and harassing place itself but we\u2019ve seen the capacity here for the opposite, the capacity to build a movement.\u201d Many point to the election of Donald Trump, a man accused of sexual assault, harassment and misogyny, as a time of political awakening. Freedman said: \u201cThe fact that a man who feels he has that privilege \u2013 \u2018I have a right to speak this way, to touch, to feel, to intimidate\u2019 \u2013 could be the president of the United States is a wake-up call to anybody who didn\u2019t speak out before.\u201d A surge in female activism followed the election. Martin said: \u201cWe can see it from the Women\u2019s March and all the levels of increased political engagement that have happened since, where people report it is women who are calling Congress and who are showing up at the town halls. \u201cWhen these [sexual harassment] stories broke it happened in a cultural moment when women were all ready to stand up and say: \u2018We are not going to accept what is unacceptable. It is not a sufficient response to say this is how the world is. We want to make a change.\u2019\u201d With more women in power, speaking out becomes easier Sexual harassment is as old as US history, a fact of life for slaves and domestic workers in the 18th and 19th centuries. When women started to work in manufacturing and clerical jobs in the early 20th century, their complaints of being harassed were dismissed as trivial. Around this time, a \u201csmash the masher\u201d movement grew up against aggressive street harassers (\u201cmashers\u201d). Women defended themselves against these men, and in Chicago some trained in parks to build both physical strength and confidence so they would be left alone. Female police officers were hired specifically to protect women. Public outrage over the masher fell away after women got the vote in 1920 and the flapper embodied a new sexual era where public \u201cflirtation\u201d was more acceptable. It wasn\u2019t until the women\u2019s liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s that anger over street harassment emerged again. As increasing numbers of women joined the workforce in the 1970s, the issue of sexual harassment at work became ever more pressing. Women shared their stories at consciousness-raising sessions and a group at Cornell University came up with the phrase \u201csexual harassment\u201d to define a range of inappropriate behaviors. In 1975 the term entered the national lexicon when journalist Lin Farley, then a lecturer at Cornell, used it publicly for the first time at a Human Rights Commission hearing into women and work, and it was reported in the press. But it was 1980 before sexual harassment was recognized by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as a form of discrimination, and something women could sue over. Freedman, author of Redefining Rape, said that although there was \u201can eruption of information\u201d about sexual harassment during this time which was documented in the press, memoir, poetry and fiction, women had little political power to effect change. \u201cThey were not very represented in state houses or in Congress. They did not have economic clout. They did not run companies,\u201d she said. \u201cNow there are so many more women with access to power and privilege. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not extremely hard for them to speak out given there\u2019s still a culture of disbelief and given the stakes, but there\u2019s a bigger, critical mass of empowered women who can do something about this.\u201d Employers now have to deal with the court of public opinion Companies are also rethinking their approach. A zero-tolerance attitude towards perpetrators is apparent, with high-profile figures being fired or resigning following accusations of sexual misconduct. Businesses don\u2019t want their brand sullied by association. Netflix has cut its ties with Kevin Spacey following sexual assault claims by multiple men; Cond\u00e9 Nast has banned the work of photographer Terry Richardson, who is accused of sexually harassing models; and the Republican National Committee has withdrawn financing from the Alabama Senate candidate, Roy Moore, following allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Elizabeth Tippett, a law professor at the University of Oregon, said: \u201cNowadays employers have to contend with the real possibility when they\u2019re investigating a harassment complaint that the victim will speak out publicly at some point and the employer will have to account for the decision it made. It has to think about whether it will be able to tell a story that is defensible in the court of public opinion.\u201d There is now a greater incentive for firms to discipline the harasser, she believes. \u201cCourts tend not to inquire very much regarding whether the employer disciplined the harasser, they care more about whether the employer took remedial measures to protect the victim, like whether they offered a change in schedule to accommodate them, or training for the harasser. Courts care a lot about whether there was a complaint process and an investigation process. They care somewhat less about what happens after that process is over. \u201cBut now employers have to think: \u2018Well, the court might say what we did was OK, but is the average person on the street going to buy our products if we kept this harasser on the payroll?\u2019 Martin, of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said that when employers feel they have something to lose they are much more likely to prioritize fixing and addressing an issue. \u201cI would expect a lot of employers are thinking about what they need to do to prevent a problem before it happens. If they\u2019re doing training, is it the right sort of training? Are there other things they need to do to identify if there is an issue \u2013 whether it\u2019s anonymous workplace surveys, or bystander training so that the entire workplace feels some responsibility to address harassment if they see it happening. \u201cEmployers are looking at the current landscape with a certain amount of trepidation and that\u2019s good.\u201d It\u2019s too soon to tell if this is the dawn of a new era of social justice, with sexism replaced by equality and respect. Anita Hill told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on 26 November that for all the takedowns of icons in Hollywood, politics and the media, there were many other ordinary women \u2013 including minimum-wage workers, immigrants, women of color \u2013 who still felt too marginalized to speak out. However, there seems no doubt that Weinstein will be seen as a major moment in the history of sexual harassment. As Tom Hanks recently told the BBC, the name Weinstein will become \u201can identifying moniker for a state of being for which there was a before and an after\u201d.

"16||Poem of the week \u2013 Walter Osborne: Apple Gathering, Quimperl\u00e9 by Frank OrmsbyWalter Osborne: Apple Gathering, Quimperl\u00e9 Weep for the green orchards of northern France before the two world wars, their apple-rich largesse bound ripely to the sap and to the sun in fertile villages. At Quimperl\u00e9, two girls are harvesting a tree bent sideways by the weight of apples, one wielding a long stick to bring them to earth, the other in her wake, bending to gather. Just now their backs are turned to the blockish bell-tower on the hill. They seem composed in their rough working clothes, and are aiming to fill that barrow with a fresh cargo of apples. The promise of baking and brewing is a scent in the air, and the prospect of rest after, say, one more tree, is what keeps them going. Each of them will wipe an apple on her dress and close her eyes and eat it slowly until the ringing of the angelus bell sets them moving to the next tree. Now their work has a taste, now they can taste the work of the orchard and will soon, for all we know, begin to sing as their arms resume stretching. Weep for the green orchards of northern France before the two world wars \u2026 Frank Ormsby\u2019s multi-stranded new collection, The Darkness of Snow, ranges over five parts, each composed of thematically connected poems or sequences. Memories of a Catholic boyhood in Enniskillen predominate in Part I, its epigraph a characteristically rueful quotation from one of the ensuing poems: \u201cWhere I grew up / the fields had names.\u201d The focus in Part IV is the poet\u2019s experience of the early stages of Parkinson\u2019s disease, and the final section, The Willow Forest, concerns itself with a fictional war-crimes tribunal whose participants bear witness from different perspectives. While such themes might promise a long descent into suffering and seriousness, Ormsby brings humour and lightness of touch to his personal writing, and lifts the darkness of snow at apt moments throughout the collection. There\u2019s a further source of light and colour: a glorious third section devoted to poems about art, Twenty-Six Irish Paintings. This is where my eye finally settled to select this week\u2019s poem. Ormsby\u2019s source was Julian Campbell\u2019s exhibition catalogue, The Irish Impressionists: Irish Artists in France and Belgium, 1850-1914. Brittany was a favoured location for many of these artists and it seems, from the ease and confidence of his writing, that Ormsby may know and love the region as intimately as they. Whatever the setting, his poems are always scrupulous representations of the paintings. Easily located online, which is some compensation for not having them to hand in the collection, the pictures add up to a revelation of the underpraised achievement of Irish impressionism. Walter Osborne: Apple Gathering, Quimperl\u00e9 is number three in the ekphrastic series and is both a war poem \u2013 of a kind \u2013 and a lament for a lost culture, pre-industrial, and seemingly prelapsarian. Ormsby\u2019s chant, \u201cWhere I grew up / the fields had names\u201d, echoes the rhythm of the opening couplet of Louis MacNeice\u2019s Autobiography. (\u201cIn my childhood, trees were green / And there was plenty to be seen.\u201d) And MacNeice\u2019s and Ormsby\u2019s lines echo distantly in the enchanted \u201cgreen orchards\u201d of Quimperl\u00e9. At such an unguarded apex of fecundity and simplicity, we might also remember Larkin\u2019s \u201cNever such innocence again.\u201d Ormsby resists intrusion on the paintings he selects. He stands discreetly back but, as their gently observant elucidator, he sets the painted figures in motion, and rearranges the stillness captured by brushstrokes to reflect the poet\u2019s concept of narrative time. In Apple Gathering, after the exhortation of the first line, to \u201cWeep for the green orchards of northern France / Before the two world wars\u201d he plunges us into locality, the rhythm of the seasons and the working day. It\u2019s harvest time, the apples are ripe, and there\u2019s a certain leisurely pressure to accomplish the work, with a future purpose, economic but also pleasurable, of \u201cbaking and brewing\u201d. The angelus bell provides the two girl-labourers with a way of dividing their work into manageable portions. Richard Doody writes that: \u201cA million Bretons answered the French call to arms in the first world war. A quarter of them never returned. Bretons were killed and wounded at a rate twice the national average.\u201d But the poet\u2019s retrospective awareness of the devastations inflicted by both world wars is not allowed to overshadow the painting\u2019s innocence. Osborne died long before the war, of course, in 1903. He was politically an even-handed painter, equally scrupulous in depicting scenes of middle-class and working-class life, more interested in his medium than any message. The girls he painted at Quimperl\u00e9 are clearly poor, but not obviously oppressed: and the land itself, or what we see of it, so far unbetrayed, rests calmly under the protection of the church and \u201cthe blockish bell-tower\u201d looming on the hill above. Ormsby takes Osborne\u2019s narrative further. His apple-gatherers achieve a perfect unity of nature and labour when they bite into the apple and find that \u201cnow their work has a taste, / now they can taste the work of the orchard\u201d. The joyous focus remains unspoiled. The largesse of the late summer orchard is not exaggerated, but it is heightened. War artists such as Paul Nash, and artist-poets such as David Jones, did lasting work in this eco-elegiac dimension. With the humbler journalists, they have branded war\u2019s \u201coutrage on nature\u201d into human consciousness, at least for present generations. We imagine battlefields and see not only mangled human corpses but trees reduced to hideous splinters. Ormsby needs only the simple refrain-like exhortation to show us these things. But first he transfixes time with an angelic image of the girls stretching upwards and \u201cfor all we know\u201d starting to sing. After which moment the only song is a keen, and the orchards vanish into smoke and mud."
"21||The Last Jedi: can Star Wars\u2019 Rey break Hollywood\u2019s obsession with privilege?British cinema is often ridiculed for its obsession with royals and aristocrats, but here\u2019s the thing: Hollywood is even worse. Having sold us American dream fables of little people rising to the top on their own merits for decades, cinema seems to have given up the pretence and admitted that it\u2019s more about who you know \u2013 or who your parents are. Looking around (the Trump dynasty, the Eton chumocracy, entrenched inequality), perhaps they\u2019re just being honest. So often, our blockbusters peddle the fantasy of social mobility, only to reveal the dice were loaded. True, some heroes get superpowers by accident (Spider-Man, Captain America, Hulk, most X-Men). But others benefit from huge inherited wealth (Batman, Iron Man), and many more are the children of royals and/or powerful families: Wonder Woman, Thor, Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s Peter Quill, Kingsman\u2019s Eggsy, the Incredibles. Harry Potter takes a more nuanced approach: magic powers can be both acquired and inherited. Compared to \u201cpureblood\u201d dynasties, half-muggle Harry is a class warrior, but still he\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d because of his ancestry. Which brings us to Star Wars. Like Harry Potter, it started out as an \u201cit could happen to you!\u201d adventure: Luke Skywalker was some random kid on a far-off planet. But, like Potter, it couldn\u2019t really happen to you. It was Luke\u2019s \u201cdestiny\u201d all along. Darth Vader was his dad, Leia was his sister, and a close brush with incest was a small price to pay for some expedient retroactive plotting. Now we have Star Wars: The Last Jedi, where the chief baddie is Luke\u2019s nephew. Star Wars\u2019s ingrown family tree makes The Crown look genetically diverse. What\u2019s more, the Force seems to be hereditary. Initially, it was \u201can energy field created by all living beings\u201d, but by the Phantom Menace, it was something in the blood. You could even test for it by measuring levels of \u201cmidi-chlorians\u201d. Star Wars lore fudges and backtracks over all this stuff, but the upshot is it\u2019s now basically a saga about aristocrats who call themselves \u201crebels\u201d. Which is why there\u2019s a lot riding on the parentage of Rey, which The Last Jedi promises to shed some light on. Is she yet another offshoot of the Skywalker clan? The secret lovechild of Leia and Jar Jar Binks, maybe? Or is Rey of some fresh, commoner blood? If it\u2019s the former, Star Wars is essentially still hooray for the blue bloods; if it\u2019s the latter, perhaps social mobility isn\u2019t extinct after all. It could be a new hope. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is in cinemas on 14 December"
"11||Jorja Smith wins 2018 Brits critics' choice awardThe Brits critics\u2019 choice award, typically a bellwether of pop music success, has been won by Jorja Smith. The Walsall neo-soul singer has already been featured on two tracks by Canadian rap superstar Drake, and scored a club hit with On My Mind, a collaboration with grime and garage producer Preditah. Her solo singles Beautiful Little Fools, Teenage Fantasy and Where Did I Go? have all earned millions of streams and YouTube views. The chairman of the Brit awards, Jason Iley, said she had \u201ca huge future ahead of her\u201d. Smith said it was \u201csuch a special way to end the year \u2026 it\u2019s been an unforgettable 2017 during which I\u2019ve fulfilled so many of my dreams.\u201d The award, voted for by figures in the music industry from major labels to the media, is designed to \u201chighlight and identify future British recording talent\u201d, and has previously been won by Adele, Ellie Goulding and Sam Smith. 2017\u2019s winner, Rag\u2019N\u2019Bone Man, went on to score the second-fastest selling album in the UK this year. Also nominated for this year\u2019s award were rapper Stefflon Don, who has already hit the Top 10 with her track Hurtin\u2019 Me, and soul singer Mabel, daughter of Neneh Cherry, whose slow-burn hit Finders Keepers also recently reached the Top 10. It was the first all-female shortlist, and Smith ends a run of five years of solo male winners."
"10||Looking after Dad led to a career in care. It's the best job I've ever hadWhen I took on the main role of caring for my dad, I recognised I had become part of the \u201csandwich generation\u201d but I didn\u2019t imagine that stage in my life would lead to a new career. A GP practice manager for much of my early working life, I had taken a step back to raise my daughter. In 2003, Dad\u2019s health deteriorated, with heart problems and Parkinson\u2019s disease. My siblings helped and visited him when they could but I lived the closest and had more time, so it made sense for me to help out the most. I\u2019d always thought of care as helping people who need to be taken to the toilet or helped into bed each evening. What I was doing was sitting and talking, going to the supermarket or helping with housework. What I didn\u2019t see at that time was the truth in front of me, that I had actually been delivering relationship-led care and companionship. I feel privileged to have spent that time caring for Dad, and in many ways I got to know more about him over those five years than I might otherwise have done. It came completely naturally to me, but in my mind being a care worker was something very different, so after Dad passed away and I felt ready to get back to work, I discounted it. I had a strong CV after my time in the NHS and felt ready for a new role. I felt I had lots to offer, but I was being told different. I went for many interviews but none led to a job offer. Then the real \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d moment came. I went for a job as a GP receptionist and, despite 12 years as a practice manager, was told I\u2019d need to retrain in all areas of office work as I was classed as unskilled. My self-esteem and confidence hit rock bottom. I drifted along with a few cleaning jobs, feeling that was how the rest of my working life would pan out. I felt professionally bruised but my career watershed came when I saw an ad in the local paper looking for care givers to work with seniors. It reignited a spark I\u2019d felt looking after Dad. It made me start to think seriously about a new career path in adult social care. I called and found that Home Instead Senior Care has a values-led recruitment approach: it is looking for people with compassion and empathy \u2013 the core character traits to do the job \u2013 rather than necessarily looking for previous experience. The fact that I didn\u2019t have qualifications in care wasn\u2019t held against me. Far from feeling like I was on the professional scrapheap, I could see a new future and, despite being 56, had a personal development plan too. I carried over the need to have a spirit of understanding from my healthcare career into the new role. It\u2019s important to build a relationship with clients as everything hinges on that. Some people aren\u2019t ready to accept they need extra help, so I take everything at a pace they\u2019re happy with. I care for six clients, working four days a week. One is centenarian Peggy, who I see on Wednesdays. I help with the morning routine: getting out of bed, bathing, dressing then making breakfast. Peggy loves poetry and I read to her most weeks. Whether it\u2019s Wordsworth, Keats or Pam Ayres, we will often say the words together. She\u2019s remarkable. Everything I do is about giving people the confidence to carry on with what they love, but with the reassurance that someone is there. It may be as simple as standing outside the bathroom door while they bathe, but it\u2019s encouraging them to do things they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have the confidence to do \u2013 and it\u2019s about building trust. The best thing about working in the care sector is really getting to know my clients: it\u2019s wonderful to build that relationship and to hear and share in their life stories. The most surprising thing about caregiving with has been the support I\u2019ve received. There are opportunities to progress further and full training is given for everything. This job is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s given me back professional purpose and I\u2019ve never done anything more rewarding.

"2||Talking Horses: 'Mr Versatile' Mick Easterby can get Monday winnerToday\u2019s best bets, by Chris Corrigan Mick Easterby has certainly proved his versatility over the last fortnight, the Sheriff Hutton trainer having saddled winners of a handicap chase, a maiden hurdle, a bumper and an all-weather handicap at Newcastle, from a total of 13 runners. Easterby\u2019s only runner on Monday is Ladies First (12.20) at Southwell. This three-year-old has very much a sprinting pedigree and she tackles six furlongs following her racecourse debut at Wolverhampton two weeks ago over an extended mile. Ladies First finished third there at 28-1, behind two short-priced rivals, and market support for her chance this time would definitely make her of interest. She\u2019s 5-2 at present. Later on the same card, Queen Moon (1.20) has a fine chance. This filly had her first run on the all-weather in October, over the same course and distance, finishing third. The winner and fourth from that race have certainly franked the form since. David Probert again takes the ride on Andrew Balding\u2019s runner, an 11-4 shot.

Ben Pauling and Harry Fry still top the table, with slightly reduced strike-rates since last Monday. Emma Lavelle has shot to prominence, thanks to three winners in the past week. Nick Williams has done well with a handful of runners. Donald McCain has had five winners since our last table was published, moving him up. That\u2019s two more than Paul Nicholls, who has slipped a bit, as has Nigel Twiston-Davies, with just one winner since Bristol De Mai\u2019s Haydock romp nine days ago. Nicky Richards and Jonjo O\u2019Neill have had a couple of winners each. Brian Ellison and Rebecca Curtis got themselves away from the bottom of the table with a single winner each, but both were on the Flat (I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have time to weed the Flat runners out of these numbers but they don\u2019t affect many of these trainers).

"2||England set to name Ben Stokes and Alex Hales in squad for Australia ODIsThe fallout from the Ben Stokes affair could bleed into England\u2019s plans for the one-day series in Australia after Christmas, with both the all-rounder and Alex Hales looking set for inclusion in the squad this week. Stokes remains suspended from international duty but Hales is free for selection after confirmation he is deemed a witness not a suspect regarding the incident in Bristol on 25 September. Eoin Morgan\u2019s touring party was due to be announced at the end of the English summer until Stokes\u2019s arrest over the incident. Though the selectors had no choice but to press ahead with the Ashes squad that week, the 50-over side was pushed back. But they will now publish their plans after the conclusion of the second Test in Adelaide and both players are expected to be provisionally included. As in the case of Stokes\u2019s absence from the Ashes series, this does not guarantee both will tour. Stokes is waiting to discover whether he will be charged after Avon &amp; Somerset police handed his case over to the Crown Prosecution Service last week, with the timing of his cricket disciplinary hearing \u2013 and any lifting of his suspension - dependent on the outcome. The England and Wales Cricket Board will not begin an internal disciplinary process for Hales or Stokes until the conclusion of any potential criminal proceedings related to the incident. In short, it all remains a bit of mess. As well as alerting the England selectors and management to Hales\u2019s availability, the ECB also approved a \u201cNo Objection Certificate\u201d to allow Hales to play in Dubai in the inaugural T10 Cricket League just before Christmas. Neither has played for their country since the third one-day international against West Indies on 24 September, the match they were celebrating when Stokes was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm at 2.35am, before being released under investigation. Stokes made a domestic comeback for Canterbury in his native New Zealand on Sunday and would naturally slot back into England\u2019s one-day side when available. Hales, however, may face a battle to win back his spot as opener after Jason Roy saw out the remainder of the West Indies series in his place and made scores of 84 and 96 alongside Jonny Bairstow. England take on Australia in a five-match one-day series that begins at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 January, before wrapping up at Perth\u2019s new stadium a fortnight later. The two countries then play a Twenty20 tri-series with New Zealand before England\u2019s epic winter continues on the other side of the Tasman with five one-dayers and two Tests."
"2||Rugby union: talking points from the weekend\u2019s Premiership action1) Care just keeps on getting better The rivalry between England\u2019s two leading scrum-halfs, Ben Youngs and Danny Care, is becoming every bit as intense as that between Matt Dawson and Kyran Bracken in the side of the late 90s/early 00s. If that was England\u2019s last great team, the vim of warring No9s is as strategically a valuable a dynamic as any. To date Care has been seen as the sparky game-breaker, with Youngs the game-shaper, but Care\u2019s all-round game continues to develop. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to remember him as a fantastic rugby player,\u201d said John Kingston, Quins\u2019 director of rugby, \u201cbut I\u2019ve talked to him about a more enduring legacy. I see a different side of him now, certainly more mature. When he manages to amalgamate that with the smatterings of sparkle dust he\u2019s always had, he looks some player.\u201d Quins aren\u2019t the only team set to benefit. Michael Aylwin Harlequins 20-19 Saracens 2) Northampton\u2019s confidence requires quick restoration Of Newcastle\u2019s five Premiership wins this was their third secured by a late score for a narrow margin of victory. When the game is tight the Falcons seem to have the golden ability to fashion a score, a good attribute to have, particularly given it secured a first league win since September. \u201cOur defence was outstanding,\u201d said their director of rugby, Dean Richards. \u201cAgainst better sides we might have been found out a little bit but we dug in and came back. I loved that aspect of it. Both sides made mistakes on the night but we found a way to win it.\u201d For Saints this was a fifth straight defeat, with only one win in nine now. They were often second best at the breakdown on Friday night and having a couple of early efforts ruled out seemed to sap their confidence, which needs restoring by the coaching team. Quickly. Claire Tolley 3) Sale\u2019s defence answers all the questions Frustration for Gary Gold as his Worcester side failed to defend a 14-11 lead against 14 men in the late stages of the game when they were the ones pushing for a score. The Sale winger Byron McGuigan was sent off for a second yellow-card offence after 66 minutes but it was the visitors who took the victory after Mark Jennings went over for a converted try on the left wing. Sale spent much of the second half defending and had their forwards to thank for what was their first away league win in 13 months. \u201cWe played 34 minutes when we only had 14 men and we showed great character to dig in for the whole of the second half,\u201d said their coach, Paul Deacon. CT 4) Exeter exhilarate in preparation for Leinster Have Exeter ever played better in the Premiership than in the opening 50 minutes of Saturday\u2019s 42-29 defeat of Bath? Probably not. Fast, physical, smart, direct, relentless \u2026 the league leaders have never been in better nick before their pivotal back-to-back European pool games with Leinster. Todd Blackadder, Bath\u2019s director of rugby, correctly identified the Chiefs\u2019 back-row trio of Matt Kvesic, Don Armand and Thomas Waldrom as \u201cunbelievable\u201d and the fly-half Gareth Steenson marshalled the onrushing traffic superbly. \u201cIt really exposed our weaknesses under pressure,\u201d admitted Blackadder, whose side were 42-10 down with eight minutes left. \u201cIt showed us what the gap is.\u201d His squad now head to Toulon for Saturday\u2019s Champions Cup game with fitness doubts still hanging over the back\u2011rows Fran\u00e7ois Louw (shoulder) and Sam Underhill (head). Robert Kitson 5) London Irish cannot afford to be off the Paice Gloucester find themselves second in the table. The comprehensive nature of the win may have come courtesy of David Paice\u2019s first-half red card but Johan Ackermann\u2019s side are the form team in the Premiership, having taken 22 points from five matches. For Irish, Nick Kennedy, the director of rugby, could hardly be blamed for his anger towards Paice. The exiles were 21-10 down at the end of the first half, when their captain was sent off for a dangerous tackle. Irish are not adrift at the bottom of the table but they desperately needed a win to build on two narrow defeats. Games against Worcester and Newcastle around Christmas will have huge significance for their season. CT Exeter 42-29 Bath 6) Cipriani proves his class to Jones, but probably in vain Nothing can be taken for granted when Eddie Jones picks an England team but it looks pretty certain that Danny Cipriani will never feature in his plans. He recently turned 30 and his season has been disrupted by a knee injury, but his return to form in Saturday\u2019s wonderful win over Leicester was a reminder, not that England\u2019s head coach will need one, of the quality of the Wasps No10. Wasps are always more of an attacking threat when Cipriani and Jimmy Gopperth are in tandem and, with Dan Robson back to his sniping best at scrum-half, Leicester were run off their feet. \u201cDanny is one of the best attacking No10s,\u201d said Wasps\u2019 director of rugby, Dai Young. \u201cHe\u2019s worked his socks off to return early and has a massive appetite to play.\u201d England\u2019s current fly-half George Ford, back in the No10 shirt for Leicester this weekend, would have been a grudging admirer. Ian Malin Wasps 32-25 Leicester"
"1||Football transfer rumours: Troy Deeney and Steven N'Zonzi to Everton?Everton\u2019s failure to adequately replace Romelu Lukaku in the summer transfer window has been cited as one of several reasons for their sluggish start to the season. The Toffees have drawn seven blanks in all competitions already this season and their new manager, Sam Allardyce, has his beady eye on Watford\u2019s club captain and striker, Troy Deeney, as a potential January recruit. Deeney has started just four Premier League matches for Watford this season and irritated his manager, Marco Silva, with very public and disparaging remarks he made regarding Arsenal\u2019s lack of \u201ccojones\u201d, an appraisal one suspects might have had Allardyce nodding in agreement. A robust, physical and no-nonsense striker built in the Kevin Davies mould, one suspects Deeney and Allardyce might get along like a house on fire. Everton are also preparing to hitch their skirts in the direction of Sevilla midfielder Steven N\u2019Zonzi, who has fallen out with his manager, Eduardo Berizzo, since being substituted in his side\u2019s draw with Liverpool last month. The \u00a325m-rated France international midfielder has not played since Sevilla\u2019s epic second-half comeback two weeks ago and has since been exiled from the first-team squad. Arsenal are also understood to be interested in giving him a new home. And on an unsurprisingly busy morning of transfer speculation regarding Everton, considering the identity of their new manager, the club \u2013 along with West Ham and Swansea City \u2013 are also being linked with a move for Augsburg\u2019s 27-year-old Ghanaian right-back, Daniel Opare. The fear of losing their best players to top Spanish sides gnaws constantly at Liverpool fans, who will be unimpressed to hear that Mohamed Salah\u2019s international manager, H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper, has confirmed that Real Madrid are keeping tabs on the Egypt winger. \u201cI\u2019ve received confirmed news revealing Real Madrid\u2019s interest in Salah, but let\u2019s not rush things,\u201d he said in an interview on Egyptian TV. \u201cTo me, he is in an amazing position right now.\u201d With most Liverpool fans resigned to losing Philippe Coutinho come season\u2019s end, it looks like another close season of fretting over another potential exit looms for denizens of Anfield. Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur both think the cut of the jib of unsettled young Real Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos is particularly well tailored, while both north London clubs are also monitoring the progress of Trabzonspor\u2019s 20-year-old Turkey international Yusuf Yazici. Arsenal\u2019s popular but underused French striker Olivier Giroud has been urged to find a new club in January in a bid to help him nail down a place in France\u2019s World Cup squad. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that he is not getting enough playing time and Didier has already spoken to him about it,\u201d said France\u2019s assistant manager Guy Stephan, of a striker who has played just 234 minutes in the Premier League this season. \u201cHe has to find a solution in the coming weeks. A departure? It is up to him. He\u2019s been very good in the past [for France] and he\u2019s played a lot of games and scored very important goals, so now he has to play.\u201d Could that summer move to Everton that failed to materialise be resurrected in January? Spanish media outlet Don Balon have said that, having grown tired of dealing with Liverpool\u2019s bean-counters in their efforts to secure the services of Coutinho, Barcelona will turn their attention to Tottenham\u2019s Christian Eriksen. Perhaps naively, they see the Denmark international as a cheaper and more low maintenance option, but if they think dealing with the Liverpool hierarchy is hard work wait until they get a load of Daniel Levy. And finally, reports in Italy say Real Madrid have set their hearts on Juventus striker Paulo Dybala and will attempt to turn the Old Lady\u2019s head with an offer of Toni Kroos plus cash."
"2||The limping Seattle Seahawks simply refuse to go awayLast week, with the Seattle Seahawks weakened by injuries and the NFL\u2019s best team coming to town, Seahawks linebacker KJ Wright uttered the phrase that might ring through the final stages of this NFL season. \u201cDon\u2019t sleep on us, man,\u201d he told The Seattle Times. \u201cThis team is still good,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are still talented. We can be the best of the best. We are the best of the best. And so just because we have injuries don\u2019t mean that things will change.\u201d On Sunday night, the Philadelphia Eagles came into Seattle on a run few teams ever experience. Their offense had been so explosive, their defense so intimidating they were looking to be the first team in 18 years to win five straight games by 20 points. They hoped to leave with the NFC East title wrapped up a month early. Given the way they had been playing and the way the Seahawks were limping, it seemed a logical conclusion both would happen. By now the NFL should know the Seahawks might be the league\u2019s grittiest team, surviving more on belief than talent these days. Instead of winning by 20, the Eagles only scored twice, losing 24-10. Carson Wentz, assumed by many to be the 2017 MVP, was harried all night. His 348 yards passing were mostly garbage yards. When Seattle\u2019s defense needed to make a stop, Wentz was pressured by swarms of players in blue, sacked three times and knocked to the ground several others. Even his two best throws \u2013 in the Eagles\u2019 only touchdown drive \u2013 came under great duress. It was as if the Seahawks were the Seahawks again \u2026 if only for a night. Injuries have been especially cruel to Seattle. Their famed Legion of Boom has been torn apart. Richard Sherman, their great defensive star, watched from under a blue jacket, his season done with a torn achilles. Kam Chancellor, their biggest intimidator, wore a stocking hat instead of a helmet. They have pieced together an offensive line and are on their sixth running back. Even with Russell Wilson having an MVP-level season of his own, there has been little about these Seahawks to say they can make another Super Bowl run. Except that they won\u2019t go away. \u201cThey didn\u2019t waver,\u201d Wilson said about his team\u2019s defense after the game. \u201cWe can\u2019t waver. This is playoff football, you can\u2019t waver.\u201d This is probably the biggest question as the season heads into the final month \u2013 and many of the NFC\u2019s top teams lack the Seahawks\u2019 playoff experience. The Vikings (the new top seed), Eagles and Rams are unaccustomed to being good this time of year. They have all been on magnificent runs but much as the Eagles discovered in Seattle, they may not be prepared for nights like Sunday when an experienced team comes at you with a frenzy you\u2019ve never encountered. Seattle have now played themselves into a wildcard spot with four games to play. They are 8-4 and just a game behind the Rams who come to Seattle in two weeks. Given the way the defense rattled Wentz and the Eagles and the way Wilson keeps making plays when no plays seem possible, there is every reason to believe Wright. Don\u2019t sleep on the Seahawks. They may just be waking up for their time of year. Fantasy player of the week Blake Bortles. Imagine the Jacksonville Jaguars at 8-4 and in seeming control of a playoff spot \u2013 perhaps even a division title? Imagine too the Jags\u2019 embattled quarterback Blake Bortles throwing for 309 yards and two touchdowns without any interceptions as he did Sunday in Jacksonville\u2019s 30-10 victory over Indianapolis. Yes, he did this against the Colts who are 3-9 in this year without Andrew Luck, but Bortles has been more efficient as the team has developed an aggressive defense and solid running game around him. There is a belief the Jaguars will look for another quarterback next season but if Bortles keeps playing as he did Sunday, the search might not be necessary. Stat of the week Eight. The number of consecutive games Denver have lost since starting the season 3-1. Given the way the Broncos have tumbled, with a sluggish offense and dreary quarterback play, it\u2019s hard to imagine they once looked like serious contenders to win the AFC West. That was back in early October, right after Denver had beaten Oakland 16-10 and the offense seemed strong enough to win games. Then everything fell apart. The Broncos, who scored 42 and 28 points in their first two games, have scored more than 20 only once since and as they have bounced between Trevor Siemian, Brock Osweiler and Paxton Lynch at quarterback. None have looked impressive as evidenced by Siemian\u2019s three interceptions in a 35-9 loss to Miami on Sunday. It\u2019s safe to say none of the three will be Denver\u2019s starting quarterback next season. The question is who will? The Broncos defense is too good for this team to be 3-9 less than two years after winning a Super Bowl. Video of the week Last week, this space wondered if the Kansas City Chiefs would be best served by benching Alex Smith and replacing him with Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback they took with the 10th pick in last spring\u2019s draft. Given the way Smith had failed miserably in third-down situations and given the way the Chiefs had stumbled in the season\u2019s second-half a quarterback change seemed likely. Instead, Kanas City coach Andy Reid gave up play-calling duties, handing them to offensive coordinator Matt Nagy. Then on Sunday Smith looked more like the Smith of the early season completing 19 of 36 passes for 366 yards and four touchdowns. But most impressive was this 70-yard run that showed off Smith\u2019s speed. Still, Smith\u2019s performance on Sunday was not enough to keep the Chiefs slide from ending. That\u2019s because \u2026 Video of the week II \u2026 Kansas City\u2019s defense could not slow the might Jets and so the Chiefs found themselves in an 11-play goalline stand that twice would have held the Jets to a field goal in a one-point game, only to have New York be awarded a fresh shot at the end zone with Chiefs penalties. When the Jets did finally score \u2013 barely \u2013 to go up by six, a two-point conversion failed. Except Kansas City was called for (what else?) another penalty. Fed up, Kansas City cornerback Marcus Peters picked up the flag and heaved it into the stands. The NFL tends to frown upon their players throwing penalty flags, especially because those little yellow handkerchiefs actually have small weights sewn into them. You can laugh and say such a thing could take an eye out, but that almost happened in a game back in 1996 when an official\u2019s flag caught Cleveland\u2019s Orlando Brown in the eye causing Brown to miss the rest of the season. Fortunately, the flag Peters threw did not hurt anyone. In fact the fans in the stands took selfies of themselves with penalty flag, but the Chiefs were unable to come back, losing their sixth game in seven weeks, 38-31. Quote of the week \u201cThrow him out!\u201d \u2013 Chant from Bills fans aimed at Rob Gronkowski. The sight of the 265lbs Gronkowski plunging onto the back of a helpless Tre\u2019Davious White as White lay on the ground was shocking. The Bills cornerback clearly not expecting contact, he held the ball he had just intercepted against his stomach and when Gronkowski jumped on him it appeared to knock his breath out. Gronkowski, who grew up in Buffalo, had reason to be angry, however. White had been holding his jersey on the previous play, keeping him from getting open and allowing the ball to be intercepted. Gronkowski appeared frustrated by the fact no penalty had been called but leaping on a defenseless player was simply dirty \u2013 a fact he acknowledged after the game when he apologized for what he did to White. None of this made a difference in the final score, a 23-3 New England victory, the Pats\u2019 eighth straight win. Elsewhere around the league --Aaron Jones ran 20 yards for a touchdown in overtime to give Green Bay a 26-20 victory over Tampa Bay and keep the Packers\u2019 flickering playoff hopes alive at 6-6. --The Baltimore Ravens are back in postseason contention with a 44- 20 victory over Detroit behind Joe Flacco\u2019s 269 passing yards and two touchdowns. Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford left the game with an injured hand in the fourth quarter. --Atlanta were far from the offensive power of last week as they lost 14-9 at home to Minnesota. Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan had just 173 yards passing as a Super Bowl team from last year fell to 7-5. They are in danger of not making the playoffs. --Jimmy Garoppolo won his first start as a San Francisco 49er, throwing for 293 yards but no touchdowns as the Niners rode five Robbie Gould field goals in an ugly 15-14 victory over Chicago. --Marshawn Lynch had his first 100-yard rushing game in two years as Oakland added to the New York Giants misery with a 24-17 victory."

"34||My childhood Christmas by Conchita Wurst, Carlos Acosta, Oti Mabuse and moreConchita Wurst, Austrian singer If they\u2019ve been good, Austrian children wake up on 6 December to find that St Nicholas has left them chocolates and nuts in their shoes. If you\u2019ve been naughty, you won\u2019t get any presents \u2026 and you\u2019ll get attacked by Krampus. He\u2019s a devil-type creature with horns, black fur and a belt with big bells, so you can hear him coming. Yes, it\u2019s terrifying. Kids go crazy for the Krampus tradition and dress up as little monsters \u2013 they have beautiful masks, handmade from wood. Our village in Austria puts on a special play in which the creature tells an old beggar to repent his sins; when he refuses, he\u2019s beaten up by lots of Krampuses at once. One year, my parents hired someone in the village to dress up as Krampus for a surprise visit to our home \u2013 and they regretted it for ever. I went to the door and this huge creature was standing there. I think I passed out. But we have nice traditions too, like St Barbara twigs. These are twigs from a fruit tree that you cut and bring into your home at the start of December. If they blossom before Christmas Eve then you will have luck for the next year. I like to party at Christmas. We always have a duck, which my brother prepares. On Christmas Eve in our house I get blackout drunk. This is fun for everyone else because the rest of my family don\u2019t drink. So I decorate the tree and entertain everybody and they\u2019re cooking and laughing like crazy at me. I think 10 in the morning is a good time for champagne, don\u2019t you? Sofie Hagen, Danish comedian In Denmark we\u2019re serious about the countdown to Christmas Eve. Yes, Eve. Danish Christmas is on the evening of the 24th. There are several TV Christmas calendars \u2013 shows that each consist of 24 episodes, with one broadcast each day. They are often about nisser, little creatures from Nordic folklore. They dress like Santa but their hats and shirts are too big for them. So the nisser might wake up on 1 December to discover that Christmas has disappeared and begin a race to find it. Or there are adult versions, such as a father taking his family hostage with a shotgun because he wants them all to get along. Spoiler alert: on Christmas Eve, everything works out for everyone. It\u2019s quite common for kids to have a whole Christmas present calendar. That means that each morning they will get a small gift, like a colouring book, a yoyo or funky socks. For the last gift, on the 24th, a clever parent will have bought a computer game or a really long film, because Danish children are notoriously uncontrollable as they have to wait right until the evening to open their main presents. Christmas dinner consists of roast pork or duck, plus boiled potatoes and caramelised potatoes which are the best thing in the world. Dessert will usually be rice porridge with whipped cream, chopped almonds and vanilla with sweet cherry sauce poured over. Then the game begins. Someone (usually the grandmother) has hidden an almond within the dessert. Whoever finds it wins a lump of marzipan shaped like a pig. You cannot go through a single Christmas party in Denmark without drinking snaps. You will all look each other in the eyes, say \u201cSk\u00e5l!\u201d and down it. Then question all your life choices. A British comedian once teased me for ordering a gin and tonic so I ordered him a shot of snaps. He downed it and started crying. I have never felt more patriotic. Carlos Acosta, Cuban dancer I grew up in Castro\u2019s Cuba, where Christmas was effectively banned because the communist tradition was against religion. In the 80s, when I was a kid, you could be fired from your job if they discovered that you were devoted to a religion, so people kept it secret. It wasn\u2019t until I arrived in America to dance with the Houston Ballet at the age of 20 that I celebrated Christmas for the first time. The director of the company had a party, with a pine tree as tall as the roof and presents under the tree. He dressed up as Santa, with the red gown and the beard, and brought all the presents around. After Pope John Paul II visited Cuba for the first time in 1998, we slowly began to celebrate Christmas publicly again. But we\u2019ve always celebrated new year in style. It\u2019s traditional to eat roasted pig and we have pork crackling, black beans and rice. Plus there\u2019s a lot of beer, rum \u2013 and music all over the place. Some people throw buckets of water out on to the street to signify a fresh start. There are celebrations in houses all along the street and you go from door to door, trying food from every neighbour\u2019s house. Henning Wehn, German comedian In Germany we have the Christkind, a little pixie who brings children their presents. It\u2019s a funny concept \u2013 she\u2019s like Father Christmas but a bit more nimble. It\u2019s easier to imagine her climbing down the chimney. Some children write to the Christkind, but not me. I wasn\u2019t raised in an overly gullible household. People reckon putting a pickle on the tree is a German tradition but we prefer angels, stars and R\u00e4ucherm\u00e4nnchen \u2013 little bearded figurines that blow out smoke. In Germany we give out presents on the 24th rather than the 25th. We go to the pub on the 23rd. But otherwise our Christmas is pretty much like it is in the UK: everyone is just pleased when it\u2019s over. Gl\u00fchwein is popular at the German markets but I can\u2019t stand that stuff. It gives you the headache of the century. Even if it\u2019s minus five outside, I\u2019d rather have a beer. To enjoy gl\u00fchwein you really need to drink it year round otherwise it\u2019s like trying to run a marathon without the training. Over Christmas, Germans often watch the 1944 movie Die Feuerzangenbowle (The Punch Bowl), about a benevolent schoolteacher who wins round all the children. But that\u2019s not as popular as Dinner for One, which we all watch on New Year\u2019s Eve. It\u2019s a 10-minute, English-language film that stars British actor Freddie Frinton as a butler who has to impersonate all four guests at a dinner party hosted by an old lady whose friends have died. The butler ends up drinking all the guests\u2019 wine and still has to do the serving. You can watch it any time from midday to midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2013 just zap through the channels because they\u2019ll all show it at some point. Oti Mabuse, South African dancer South Africa is really diverse, with many cultures and 11 official languages, so there are lots of different Christmas traditions. As it\u2019s our summertime, people will often celebrate outside. We\u2019re a meat-loving country: our family has a barbecue with chicken, pork chops, steak and fish \u2013 and we\u2019ll make lots of salads. Then we go to the beach and play in the water and swim. We\u2019ll put up an artificial tree at home. My sister loves to play Christmas music \u2013 especially Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas Is You \u2013 that\u2019s definitely the best to dance to. I was born and raised in Pretoria. Nobody ever really talked about Santa because the whole concept just didn\u2019t make sense to us. Think about what South Africa looks like: I mean, we don\u2019t even have any chimneys for him to come down! When I was 11 we went to Germany for Christmas and I remember hating the fact I had to wear boots and a scarf to stay warm. My face was frozen and I couldn\u2019t move! In London, I live with one of the other Strictly dancers, Amy Dowden. She got me a chocolate advent calendar and I had no idea what it was. I\u2019d never seen one before! We have the Strictly final on 16 December and then I\u2019ll fly straight home to South Africa. Then I\u2019ll be back to the beach, wearing a summer dress and eating an ice cream. Alma, Finnish singer In Finland we give Santa the name Joulupukki. He lives in the northern part of the country. In some countries, Santa is just for little kids but in Finland he\u2019s really a big deal for everyone. My grandparents lived in Lapland so I visited them many times at Christmas with my twin sister. There\u2019s a place in Lapland where you can go and meet Joulupukki \u2013 it\u2019s touristy, of course, but cute too. On the 25th, people go to church or they visit the graves of their relatives. It\u2019s a day to be with your family. We open our presents on the 24th and that\u2019s when we have the big meal. We don\u2019t do turkey: we eat ham with a variety of vegetable mashes. Having a sauna is the main tradition. I\u2019d say 70% of Finns have a sauna on Christmas Eve. There\u2019s snow too, of course, so you can go and play or ski. I like to go ice-dipping but some people definitely don\u2019t. I mean, it\u2019s not nice, but the feeling afterwards is crazy. You can feel every vein in your body pumping. It\u2019s good if you\u2019ve been feeling gross after eating all day! Sofie Hagen is at Soho theatre, London, 11-15 and 19-21 December. Henning Wehn\u2019s DVD Westphalia Is Not an Option is out now. Oti Mabuse is on a UK tour with Ian Waite in The Rhythm of the Night, from 20 March to 17 June. Alma\u2019s new single Phases is out now."
"7||If Meghan Markle represents the \u2018mixed-race community\u2019, what about me?When Prince Harry announced his engagement to Meghan Markle it was clear she was going to be a very \u201cdifferent\u201d kind of princess. Markle is a successful American actor and campaigner for women\u2019s rights. But the many headlines that labelled her \u201cunconventional\u201d did so not because of her career or anything particularly striking about her personal life, but because of the fact that she is mixed-race. Media coverage of their engagement focused heavily on Markle\u2019s ethnicity, with the BBC doing a feature on interracial couples and an article in the Metro boldly stating: \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for interracial couples and mixed-race girls everywhere.\u201d It could have been a moment to open up a wider and much-needed conversation about the diversity of the mixed-race experience. Markle herself has spoken about growing up biracial, telling an interviewer that she remembers not knowing whether to tick \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d when filling out a diversity form, so she left it blank. She says how this sense of uncertainty followed her into her acting career, being too \u201cblack\u201d for white roles and too \u201cwhite\u201d for black ones. However, the media mostly responded by using Markle\u2019s ethnicity to \u201cprove\u201d how far we\u2019ve come as a nation in terms of embracing people from all races and cultures. The truth is, if we insist on depicting her as symbolic of the mixed-race experience, Markle serves as a reminder that no matter what we achieve, our ghost of \u201cincompleteness\u201d will continue to haunt us. The incredible scope of the mixed-race experience is continually glossed over. Former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman said there was a \u201cperfect type of mixed race\u201d, with fair skin and straightened hair, that Markle conforms to. However, many women of black and white heritage, myself included, have darker skin and curly, afro hair that, thanks to our Eurocentric standards of beauty, are seen as less desirable. The media\u2019s effort to paint Markle as a patron for this imaginary mixed-race community therefore excludes many of us who do not have this commonly assumed \u201cbeauty privilege\u201d. Today, advertisers have hit on the idea of selling us the multicultural dream, using the mixed-race experience to symbolise modernness, diversity, and integration \u2013 though hardly ever treating it as a racial identity in its own right. What\u2019s more, it lulls us into believing that our nation is a tolerant one, a description that many ethnic minority individuals would disagree with: given the rise in hate crime, the fact that black and minority children account for 60% of child arrests, and the day-to-day micro-aggressions we face. Nevertheless, I will be glued to my television when the royal wedding takes place. I think it\u2019s important that we see it for what it is \u2013 a celebration of love and commitment between two individuals. Forcing a multicultural symbolism on top of it is just too complex and heavy a burden, and in reality proves how far we still have to go as a nation in understanding racial identity. \u2022 Georgia Chambers is a freelance journalist and writer. Her blog, Breaking Tides, documents her experiences trying to navigate her mixed-race identity"
"4||Cathay Pacific flight crew say they saw North Korean missile testThe crew of a Cathay Pacific flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong reported seeing a North Korean ballistic missile break up and fall out of the sky last week, the airline has said, highlighting an unforeseen danger of Pyongyang\u2019s weapons tests. Flight trackers put the plane close to Japan around the time of Pyongyang\u2019s Hwasong-15 missile test on 29 November. The missile fell into the Sea of Japan. Pyongyang claimed its latest intercontinental ballistic missile was capable of striking anywhere in the US. North Korea has not yet proved it can mount a miniaturised nuclear warhead on its missiles, but the latest test is likely to strengthen its negotiating power with Washington. \u201cThe flight crew of CX893 reported a sighting of what is suspected to be the re-entry of the recent DPRK test missile,\u201d an airline spokesman said, referring to North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. \u201cThough the flight was far from the event location, the crew advised Japan [air traffic control] according to procedures.\u201d The flight was not affected and the company had no plans to change existing routes, the airline said. Mark Hoey, Cathay Pacific\u2019s general manager of operations, recounted the message from the crew of the passenger plane to ground staff. \u201cBe advised, we witnessed the DPRK missile blow up and fall apart near our current location,\u201d the pilots said, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. A Cathay Pacific cargo plane \u2013 CX096 \u2013 may have been even closer to the missile, at a lateral distance of a few hundred metres, Hoey added, according to the report. That flight was bound for Alaska and was also over Japan at the time of the missile test."
"4||Abbas warns world leaders over Trump's recognition of JerusalemThe Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has sought to rally last-minute diplomatic support to persuadeDonald Trump not to recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, amid persistent speculation that he might do so in a speech this week. The suggestion that Trump might unilaterally recognise Jerusalem \u2013 parts of which Palestinians also claim for the capital of their own future state \u2013 has been circulating in recent days as the US president deliberates on whether to renew the six-monthly waiver to a law mandating the transfer of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The deadline for Trump to sign the waiver falls on Monday. It has been claimed \u2013 including by his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, on Sunday evening \u2013 that he has still not decided what to do. Kushner \u2013 who was speaking at the Saban Forum in Washington for the first time at length in public about his role in the Middle East peace process \u2013 said the president was \u201cstill looking at a lot of facts\u201d, and he did not deny that Trump was considering the issue. The suggestion that Trump could recognise Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital was being touted as a step short of moving the embassy. While largely symbolic, it is being fiercely opposed by a number of countries in the region. Among those adding their voices to stark warnings against the move was the Arab League leader, Ahmed Abul Gheit, who said his organisation was closely following the issue and was in contact with the Palestinian authorities and Arab states to coordinate a position if Trump takes that step. \u201cIt is unfortunate that some are insisting on carrying out this step without any regard to the dangers it carries to the stability of the Middle East and the whole world,\u201d he said in Cairo on Sunday. \u201cNothing justifies this act \u2026 it will not serve peace or stability, instead it will nourish fanaticism and violence.\u201d The White House was warned again last week by US foreign policy and security officials of the risks to US diplomacy and security in the region raised by moving the embassy. Jordan\u2019s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, tweeted that he had contacted the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, over the risks of recognising Jerusalem. \u201cSpoke with #US Secretary of State Tillerson on dangerous consequences of recognising Jerusalem as capital of Israel. Such a decision would trigger anger across #Arab #Muslim worlds, fuel tension &amp; jeopardise peace efforts,\u201d Safadi wrote. Abbas placed a series of phone calls on Sunday with world leaders both to \u201cexplain the dangers of any decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem or recognise [Jerusalem] as Israel\u2019s capital,\u201d a spokesman said. Abbas told a group of visiting Arab lawmakers from Israel: \u201cAny American step related to the recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel, or moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, represents a threat to the future of the peace process and is unacceptable for the Palestinians, Arabs and internationally.\u201d Abbas has called Arab leaders, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Erdo\u011fan told Abbas that an independent Palestinian state must have East Jerusalem as its capital, the Turkish state-run Anadolu news agency reported. Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, HR McMaster, said the president\u2019s advisers had presented him with a number of options on the issue. \u201cThere are options involving the move of an embassy at some point in the future, which I think could be used to gain momentum toward a peace agreement and a solution that works both for Israelis and for Palestinians,\u201d McMaster said."
"1||Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend's action1) Guardiola\u2019s men chasing possible record number of records After another victory that seemed inevitable, despite West Ham basically building a wall, then behind it a slightly taller wall on the edge of the penalty area, it\u2019s worth having a look at some records that Manchester City could have their eye on. Beat Manchester United next weekend and they will equal the mark for most consecutive wins (14, by Arsenal in 2002) in the Premier League era. They are nearly halfway to the most wins in a season (30, by Chelsea last term) and well on the way to the points record (95, by Chelsea in 2004-05) and goals record (103, Chelsea again, in 2009-10). A victory over United will put them on 46 points from 16 games, which would have been enough to come eighth last season, and their 46 goals are already more than were managed by the team that did finish in that spot, Southampton. They\u2019re pretty good, really. Nick Miller Manchester City 2-1 West Ham: Silva digs in to beat Hammers Guardiola happy as City repeat \u2018Fergie time\u2019 trick against West Ham West Ham\u2019s show of attacking gusto serves up hope for Moyes 2) Brilliant Hazard challenged to aim even higher Eden Hazard has played the best football of his career under Antonio Conte and it is clear that the Belgian can get even better if he trusts his manager. Conte is a relentless coach and, though he regularly champions Hazard\u2019s talent, the Italian was quick to point out that the world\u2019s finest players make their names on the biggest stages. Hazard excelled in Chelsea\u2019s 3-1 win over Newcastle United, scoring twice, but the forward has been challenged to aim even higher than destroying Premier League defences. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Eden is at the peak of his career,\u201d Conte said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for him to work, work, work in every training session to improve himself. You are at the top when you win the Ballon d\u2019Or the first time, when you win the Champions League, when you win the Word Cup. At that moment you are at the top of the world.\u201d Jacob Steinberg Chelsea 3-1 Newcastle: Hazard puts paid to visitors\u2019 hopes of shock 3) Lacazette showing his worth even in defeat Ars\u00e8ne Wenger seemed a bit vexed trying to explain the slightly paradoxical nature of Arsenal\u2019s loss to Manchester United because he had seen something very positive from his team\u2019s attacking waves, yet it was all overshadowed by the result. One theme that has emerged in the last week, over the home games against Huddersfield and United, is how Alexandre Lacazette has taken a big step in his integration. Wenger took a cautious approach with his record signing in the first part of the season, rather puzzlingly holding off on starts and regularly substituting the French striker. The match against United was his first complete 90 minutes in the Premier League since the opening day. His adjustment to Arsenal\u2019s game \u2013 and his team-mates better reading of his excellent movement \u2013 has taken time but he now looks totally involved and pivotal to the way Wenger wants his team to attack. Amy Lawrence Arsenal 1-3 Man Utd: Lingard strikes twice as Pogba sees red Arsenal gifts undermine display as United make the right calls De Gea brings greatness to bear for United to repel onslaught Pogba was United\u2019s heartbeat but has given Mourinho headache 4) Pochettino unfazed by latest defensive setbacks With Davinson S\u00e1nchez likely to miss three matches as a result of the straight red card he received for throwing his arm into Richarlison\u2019s face, Spurs are facing a defensive shortage. Toby Aldeweireld has suggested he could be out for as long as four months with injury, while Cameron Carter-Vickers is on loan at Sheffield United with no recall option. Mauricio Pochettino, therefore, has only Jan Vertonghen and Eric Dier with significant experience at centre-half. On the other hand, Ben Davies has deputised in a back three and there is the Argentinian teenager Juan Foyth, signed from Estudiantes in the summer. Pochettino remained unruffled, though, after watching his team battle for a point at Watford (only their second in four matches). \u201cI am not going to complain if S\u00e1nchez will be out for a few games\u201d, he said. \u201cThat is football. It is about the squad. If he cannot play we will play with another.\u201d Paul MacInnes Watford 1-1 Tottenham: 10-man Spurs hold on for point 5) Rooney renaissance enthuses Allardyce Wayne Rooney gave a display of passing and pointing. His defence-splitting ball led to Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s goal and he also enforced Sam Allardyce\u2019s orders, talking team-mates into position. This authoritative display, coupled with his hat-trick against West Ham three days earlier, came after he had been an unused substitute in the previous two league games. That may not happen again soon. \u201cHe produced a good performance today and a brilliant one on Wednesday,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cSo we have to really make sure we get him ready for every game. If we get the physical side of Wayne right then that ability never ever leaves you.\u201d He remains such an admirer of Rooney that it feels possible the stand-in skipper will replace the injured Phil Jagielka as captain. \u201cHe has had more criticism in the last couple of years than he has had praise and I think that he has handled that brilliantly,\u201d added Allardyce. Richard Jolly Record-breaking Sam Allardyce is off to a flying start at Everton Everton 2-0 Huddersfield: Allardyce has desired effect in win 6) Liverpool leave tantalising taste of what could be It was a slightly curious experience watching Liverpool thrash Brighton 5-1. On the one hand their counterattacks were so good they were life-affirming. But on the other you were left with the nagging question: if Liverpool are this good, then why aren\u2019t they better? The win, their fifth in six Premier League games, took them up to fourth, but their vim and quality going forward is that of a side who should be challenging Manchester City. The obvious answer is their defence but the glint of mental fragility that led to them conceding a three-goal lead against Sevilla is a big part of it, too. After the win at the Amex J\u00fcrgen Klopp admitted that when Glenn Murray made it 3-1, that game flashed before his eyes. \u201cWhen you have it once, unfortunately it needs a bit of time to get rid of it completely,\u201d he said. When that speck of doubt is erased, Liverpool will be much stronger. NM Brighton 1-5 Liverpool: Firmino on target twice for five-star Reds 7) Allen shows Swansea what they are missing In a poor game at the Bet365 Stadium that served up precious few moments of class, Joe Allen was a shining light with his display in the centre of the Stoke City midfield. The Welshman set up Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s equaliser with a lovely through ball and was at the heart of Stoke\u2019s more promising moments, with the sort of composure and intelligent passing that deserved a better stage than a scrappy fixture between two uninspiring teams. It was, in summary, an excellent piece of business on Stoke\u2019s part when they signed Allen from Liverpool in the summer before last, and a glaring and unforgivable error from Swansea\u2019s point of view to miss out on him. Allen, after all, had wanted to return to the club that he continues to support. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to stick at it and, as a fan now, I\u2019m hoping they do just that,\u201d Allen said about Swansea after Stoke\u2019s 2-1 victory. Stuart James Stoke City 2-1 Swansea City: Clement says Swans deserve to be bottom Swansea tempers boil over in angry dressing-room row among players 8) Further justification of Puel intentions When Leicester sacked Craig Shakespeare eight games into the season, a few months after he saved them from relegation, it was fair to wonder if the board had acted hastily. Less reasonable was the antipathy that greeted the appointment of Claude Puel. The rules that govern such matters are not scientific, but he had previously led Monaco to a Ligue 1 title and Lyon to the Champions League semi-finals. Then in his first season in England he took Southampton to a final \u2013 where they played superbly \u2013 and to an eighth-place finish, only to be sacked for football unbefitting the club\u2019s sophisticated tastes. At Leicester, he is extracting the most from Riyad Mahrez, Jamie Vardy, and Demarai Gray \u2013 whose talent Shakespeare was not prepared to trust. City, third-bottom when he was appointed, now sit ninth, two places and three points above ... Southampton. Daniel Harris Leicester City 1-0 Burnley: Gray takes pains to sink Clarets 9) Bournemouth hope for best of Fraser Ryan Fraser\u2019s biggest challenge has been finding some consistency. If he can perform well regularly, Bournemouth will reap rewards. The Scotland winger\u2019s indifferent form has frustrated himself as much as it has Eddie Howe, so much so that he asked to play for the under-21s against Plymouth Argyle last month to build some confidence. Fraser, a \u00a3400,000 signing from Aberdeen four years ago, scored his first league goal of the season against Southampton on Sunday and Howe is hoping that strike will prove significant in the long run. \u201cI\u2019m one of Ryan\u2019s biggest fans,\u201d the Bournemouth manager said. \u201cFor whatever reason he\u2019s had a slightly stuttering start to the season. We haven\u2019t seen him at his fluent best. I can\u2019t speak highly enough of his ability as a player. I just hope he can do it on a consistent basis.\u201d Ben Fisher Bournemouth 1-1 Southampton: Austin cancels out Fraser opener 10) Field and Loftus-Cheek stand out in stalemate It was edifying to see some of the best moments of quality from Saturday\u2019s goalless draw between two relegation-threatened teams at The Hawthorns come from a couple of England youngsters promising to make a consistent impact in the Premier League. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, now 21, has long been heralded as the best of Chelsea\u2019s loan stars and is playing without fear despite Crystal Palace only just rising off the foot of the table; Sam Field, 19, has returned to West Brom\u2019s team since Tony Pulis\u2019s dismissal and played three games in an unbeaten week. Recently promoted to the England under-21s after starring for Keith Downing\u2019s Under-20s, the local lad has grace and poise. Outstanding on his recent full senior international debut, Loftus-Cheek is also being edged into a wide role in a compact midfield four for Palace. But while he has licence to roam, he is also willing to track and do some of the dirty work required of that position in a lower-half team.

"0||Turnbull government scrambles after temporarily losing vote on New Zealand refugee offerThe Turnbull government has briefly lost control of the lower house, losing a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, with the chamber passing a motion calling for asylum seekers on Manus Island to be sent to New Zealand. The Greens motion, calling on the government to accept New Zealand\u2019s offer to resettle 150 refugees and negotiate conditions similar to the US refugee resettlement agreement, initially passed the house 73 votes to 72 in an upset vote late on Monday afternoon. The Liberal MP Warren Entsch missed the division because he was being interviewed on television, as did the frontbencher Steve Ciobo, who later told the house he was \u201cunfortunately detained\u201d \u2013 an explanation that prompted howls of derision from across the chamber. The manager of government business, Christopher Pyne, scrambled shortly after the defeat to recommit the vote, ignoring voluble protests from the Labor party. The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, declared the vote had been lost because \u201c[government MPs] can\u2019t turn up for work\u201d. Burke said the vote had been entirely anticipated so there could be no valid claims of misadventure requiring a rerun of the vote. Once the missing MPs returned to the chamber, the government was able to force a rerun and it eventually won the division, successfully seeing off the Greens motion. The motion, which had passed the Senate, was always going to be a close-run vote, because it had the support of the ALP and all of the lower house crossbenchers, apart from Queensland\u2019s Bob Katter. As the chamber descended into a procedural skirmish before the vote was recommitted, the journalist Behrouz Boochani, who is one of the refugees on Manus Island, took to Twitter to express hope that Australia could ultimately turn to New Zealand. The Greens lower house MP Adam Bandt also took to Twitter to declare supporters of the men on Manus would keep fighting to try to secure a transfer to New Zealand. The government enters the final sitting week for 2017 vulnerable because it is down two MPs in the lower house. The Liberal John Alexander is fighting to hold his seat of Bennelong at a byelection, and the National Barnaby Joyce prevailed in the New England byelection at the weekend but is not yet back in the chamber. The lost vote on Monday afternoon followed separate disruption to government business in the Senate, with the government pulling superannuation legislation and reordering business because it lacked the numbers to steer the bill through the chamber. The government was, however, spared one embarrassment, with a decision by the outspoken Queensland MP George Christensen to backflip on an earlier suggestion he could go against government policy and support amended legislation restoring lost penalty rates. The headline for this story was amended on 5 December 2017 to clarify that the vote to accept New Zealand\u2019s refugee offer was later overturned."

"7||The key to a great Christmas film: misery and mayhemAt first glance, it might appear that Christmas films are pretty easy to make. Take a mediocre family film, put everyone in knitted jumpers, have a couple of scenes set at a snowy ice rink where the protagonist delivers some festive dialogue (\u201cbrrr, it sure is cold this mid-to-late December\u201d), and just like that, you\u2019ve got a film like Daddy\u2019s Home 2, a film so Christmassy it\u2019s made everyone in the world forget all those things Mel Gibson said about Jews and black people. But creating a classic Christmas movie is actually quite hard. For one thing, the original story of Christmas is kind of a snoozefest - \u201cI gave birth in a barn and then a bunch of academics gave me some gold\u201d is a killer anecdote to liven up a dinner party, but not a great basis for 2,000 years of storytelling. For a Christmas movie to really pop, it needs some magic ingredients. After extensive research (hey, I\u2019ve read more than 10 plot summaries of Christmas movies on Wikipedia) I can reveal the secret elements for creating the most joyous Christmas movies ever! Murderous criminals All good Christmas movies feature a few people who have killed before and will kill again. What would Die Hard be without Alan Rickman\u2019s Hans Gruber and his terrorist team of Baywatch rejects? It would be a film about Bruce Willis making awkward small talk at his estranged wife\u2019s office Christmas party. Home Alone, without Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, is effectively 90 minutes of boring child neglect. Paul Blart: Mall Cop (a future classic Christmas movie, if only for the bizarre fact that all the bad guys are named after Santa\u2019s reindeer) would just be Kevin James riding a Segway around an empty mall (admittedly that\u2019s arguably a better film). In fact, the tale of a group of criminals attempting to burgle a vulnerable building before being defeated by a rogue hero is now pretty much a classic Christmas story, the 21st-century version of A Christmas Carol. In 20 years\u2019 time there will probably be a Muppet version of it, where Kermit has to stealth around office vents with bloody feet and garotte Muppet members of Hans Gruber\u2019s team (inevitably played by Christoph Waltz). Attempted suicide What Christmas movie is complete without a couple of miserable people deciding to end it all? Obviously the big one here is It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, wherein Jimmy Stewart almost jumps to his death, driven by the Human Embodiment of Hypercapitalism (Mr Potter), and is only stopped by a man in a nightie. But it comes up in a surprising number of other Christmas films: in Trading Places, Dan Ackroyd tries to kill himself after being made destitute on a whim by the super-rich Duke brothers, while in Scrooged, Bobcat Goldthwait goes on a rampage in a TV studio after being fired by Bill Murray, who is basically the unshrivelled American version of Rupert Murdoch. It\u2019s worth noting that every one of these characters is pushed towards suicide by the worst excesses of capitalism: in fact, most Christmas films have a pseudo-communist edge to them (people are more important than money, commercialisation is evil, follow the star). Remember parents \u2013 if you see your kids watching too many Christmas films this year, try to balance it out with some pro-capitalist media too: the animated Animal Farm, a documentary on Warren Buffet and a bingewatch of Theo Paphitis-era Dragons\u2019 Den. Accidental manslaughter If you can\u2019t fit in a murderer or a suicide, try to make sure at least one of your characters is responsible for the death of an innocent. At the very start of (U-certified) The Santa Clause, Tim Allen causes Santa Claus to fall off his roof to his death. After the first 15 minutes, which are effectively an extended Christmas special of an Injury Lawyers 4U advert, it only gets weirder. Due to the death occurring on his property, Tim Allen is forced to give up his old life as Scott Calvin and is pressed into servitude as Santa Claus. Not only that, he becomes a host body for a parasite known as \u201cthe Christmas Spirit\u201d, which makes him put on weight and grow a beard against his will. By the end of the movie, Scott Calvin no longer exists \u2013 there is only Santa Claus. The best Christmas movies challenge children, making them ask questions like: \u201cWhat happened to the body of the old Santa Claus?\u201d; \u201cDid the entire identity of Scott Calvin deserve to be erased from the Earth?\u201d; and \u201cHow did this get two sequels?\u201d Ultimately doomed marriages There are countless failed marriages in Christmas movies, and most of them are in Love Actually. Emma Thompson and the cheating Alan Rickman (cementing his place as the Best Christmas Bastard) are clearly doomed, but all the other marriages in that movie are also fatally undermined: Andrew Lincoln destroys Keira Knightley\u2019s marriage to Chiwetel Ejiofor by turning up on her doorstep with a stack of cuecards and a lack of understanding about boundaries; Martine McCutcheon would have left prime minister Hugh Grant after years of press intrusion; and Colin Firth and L\u00facia Moniz don\u2019t speak the same language and rushed into marriage mostly based on him falling into a pond. Special mention has to go to Elf as well, which ends with an oversized elf with questionable understanding of modern society marrying a sophisticated New Yorker 13 years his junior. Either Zooey Deschanel\u2019s character would have divorced him before next Christmas or Will Ferrell\u2019s character would have died trying to use a microwave. The realisation that laws and society are ultimately meaningless The best Christmas movies should challenge your very understanding of civil society. Miracle on 34th Street (1994), in which Father Christmas is put on trial by the state of New York, does that and so much more. There\u2019s so much to unpack in this movie \u2013 at one point Father Christmas is facing life in a mental institution, and at another point it\u2019s heavily implied he has the power to make women magically pregnant \u2013 but the highlight is the conclusion of the court case, in which the judge, upon realising that all money has \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d on it, rules that people can believe in Richard Attenborough as Santa Claus without proof because the US government trusts in the existence of God without proof. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most terrifyingly libertarian legal judgments to ever be recorded on film. Sure, it gets Kris Kringle off the hook, but at what cost? It effectively legitimises the idea that all evidence-based reasoning can be dismissed, challenges the very concept of objective truth and would, followed to its logical conclusion, lead to the end of the rule of law and the destruction of civilisation as we know it. And really, in the end, isn\u2019t that what Christmas is all about? \u2022 Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and occasional performer.

"22||My husband is always irritable, but says he wouldn\u2019t be if we had sex moreI am really frustrated with my husband. He is irritable, disengaged and sulky. When I ask what\u2019s wrong, he replies \u201cnothing\u201d, but then later attacks me about how he would be in a much better mood if we had sex more. But I don\u2019t want to have sex with a person who constantly tries to make me feel ashamed/guilty over not wanting him. Would opening up the relationship help? When anger arises in a relationship and becomes as pervasive as it has in your marriage, it causes such a gulf between the partners that getting back on track \u2013 including recovering your erotic connection \u2013 can be enormously challenging. I understand your despair, but an open relationship is not the answer. What is required is a frank and respectful expression of true feelings, and a serious attempt by both of you to solve this impasse. Many people are afraid of their anger and do not know how or where to direct it. Your husband seems to prefer a passive-aggressive style, and perhaps neither of you is comfortable with expressing anger directly. But unexpressed anger kills sexual feelings and destroys relationships, so finding a way to express it appropriately is vital. Very often, other feelings lie beneath the anger and they need to be expressed in a way that avoids blame, shame or escalation of conflict, and acknowledges the underlying pain. There is no magic wand to restore your sex life; just talk. \u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders \u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).

"5||The \u2018second-hand dad\u2019 look \u2013 why hiking jackets are having a momentFashion loves to find something thumpingly banal and declare that it\u2019s \u201chaving a moment\u201d and, right now, this season\u2019s most in-demand menswear item is ... the dog-walking jacket. Welcome to the world of haute hiking wear: the kind of thing you keep stashed in the car boot, the sort of thing Theresa May wears to walk over the Dolomites, and which is \u2013 like one North Face Supreme X jacket \u2013 now fetching up to \u00a34,500 on the resale market. It is a perfect storm of high, new fashion and serious technical wear. Take, for example, North Face, whose padded Nuptse jacket turns 25 this month. Current collaborations with designers Junya Watanabe, Sacai and Supreme have long sold out at fashion mecca Dover Street Market and it has just launched a new collaboration with the cult Japanese brand Mastermind, which should sell like hot cakes. Elsewhere, the Italian technical brand Napapijri has a second collaboration with designer Martine Rose, who recently dressed singer Frank Ocean, and the US outdoors brand Columbia \u2013 known for its technical T-shirts and fleeces \u2013 has launched a new collection of pop-coloured anoraks with the hip New York store Opening Ceremony. In September, GQ Style coined the term \u201csecondhand dad\u201d for the look: an aesthetic it describes as \u201cdressing like your dad, going for a walk in the woods, some time in the early 1990s\u201d. But why spend thousands on the designer version of a technical piece when it is probably equally or less effective than a true outdoor brand? \u201cYou\u2019re not going to go and scale the Eiger in this coat. It\u2019s made for hanging out in Dover Street Market,\u201d says Richard Gray, senior editor at 10 magazine, who bought the Junya Watanabe jacket, which costs up to \u00a31,895. For Gray, owning one of these pieces is equally about the bragging rights that comes with it. \u201cIt\u2019s like Top Trumps,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s something competitive about it. And I could bore you to death with the technical details on it.\u2019\u2019 To insiders, luxury variants of these coats come with a refinement that you won\u2019t get from a typical outdoor brand: this season\u2019s technical jackets by the US designer Patrik Ervell are lined in silk instead of synthetic fabric. Yet they are still sturdier than a typical designer coat \u2013 Damien Paul, the head of menswear for matchesfashion.com, notes that the designer coats that the site carries are still made to highly technical specifications. \u201cThey have to work in real life,\u201d he says. These come hot on the heels of the rise of athleisure and sportswear, a market that has dominated menswear. If you wear running gear to a party, why not a hiking jacket? The US fashion press tried to make the neologism \u201cgorpcore\u201d happen this season (gorp is shorthand for trail mix) but since \u201cgorp\u201d doesn\u2019t exist in the UK as a term it never took off. Hiking wear, however, sounds less sexy but is actually happening. The online retailer SSENSE reports rapid sellouts of its Balenciaga ski jackets, while matchesfashion.com has seen a \u201chuge uplift\u201d in styles from the likes of Lanvin and Martine Rose. Paul has responded by introducing heritage technical brands, such as Helly Hansen, to the site\u2019s roster for this season. Meanwhile, for years brands such as Stone Island and Moncler have quietly built multimillion-pound businesses from elevated, functional garments \u2013 but even these brands are seeing a greater traction with younger, more fashion-led consumers, who are looking to buy into the authentic outerwear brands, instead of designer variations. Napapijri\u2019s hooded pullover jacket, originally designed for Arctic exploration and now a fixture on streetwear sites, is seeing a \u201ctriple-digit\u201d growth in sales, while Helly Hansen has noted a large increase in sales from the younger market. Stone Island, in particular, has become revered among a new generation ofyounger consumers following successful collaborations with Supreme and Nike. \u201cThey are certainly hard to beat,\u201d argues David Fischer, founder of the streetwear site Highsnobiety. \u201cIt\u2019s something they\u2019ve always done. Stone Island was founded on technical innovation and still does that today.\u201d Tapping into a younger, trendier market was a conscious decision on the part of Carlo Rivetti, Stone Island\u2019s creative director. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working for 10 years now to attract a new generation of fans,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut since our inception we have looked at function and performance fabrics. Fashion houses do not have this kind of approach.\u201d This article contains affiliate links to products.

"14||Doctors tell Home Office to scrap immigration removal centresThe British Medical Association is calling for immigration removal centres (IRCs) to be phased out and replaced with a more humane system of community monitoring because of concerns about the serious impact on the health of detainees. The report, published on Monday, calls for sweeping changes to the way IRCs are run because of a range of concerns about issues including restraint, segregation, PTSD and the management of complex health conditions. BMA chiefs say a \u201cfundamental rethink\u201d is required by the Home Office. While human rights campaigners have expressed concerns about immigration detention conditions for many years, it is the first time that the doctors\u2019 union has made such a strong call. The BMA says it has published this report because of its growing concern about health and human rights in detention settings. The UK operates one of the largest systems of immigration detention in Europe, holding around 3,500 individuals in 11 IRCs at any one time. The new report, Locked Up, Locked Out: health and human rights in immigration detention, finds that immigration detainees are \u201cvilified and ignored in equal measure\u201d behind bars. The BMA is demanding action from government and policymakers on aspects of detention policy and practice that are detrimental to health. While immigration detention continues, it aims to support doctors and other members of the healthcare team in providing the best possible care for those detained. \u201cIn our view, the detention of people who have not been convicted of a criminal offence should be a measure of last resort,\u201d the report states. \u201cDetention should be reserved for individuals who pose a threat to public order or safety. Ultimately, we believe that the use of detention should be phased out and replaced with alternate, more humane means of monitoring individuals facing removal from the UK.\u201d The researchers add that while detention continues, it should be time-limited, with asylum seekers and other migrants detained for the shortest possible time. The report is highly critical of the Home Office and also of NHS England, which has been responsible for commissioning healthcare in IRCs in England since 2013. \u201cProblems with the accuracy and timeliness of health assessments, availability of services, staff shortages, and ensuring continuity of care have all been identified as adversely impacting on the standard of care provided in detention. For some detainees with complex health needs, there is a question of whether their needs can be met in the detention setting,\u201d the report states. Of particular concern to the BMA is the way doctors may find their ethical obligations to patients in conflict with the demands of the centre staff and Home Office officials who may try to draw them into issues around restraint and segregation. The rule 35 process is supposed to highlight specific vulnerabilities, such as torture and PTSD relating to detainees, but the report says the rule 35 process is not always properly understood by detention centre staff. The BMA is calling for a pre-detention screening process to be introduced before individuals are detained to highlight those who are too vulnerable to be locked up. The practice of moving detained individuals into and between IRCs at night or early in the morning should end, says the BMA, unless there are exceptional reasons for doing so. Forced restraint and segregation should be used only as a last resort. In particular, segregation units should not routinely be used as a way of managing individuals at risk of suicide, self-harm, or those experiencing a serious mental health crisis. The authors of the report emphasise that doctors must be able to act with complete clinical independence and ensure that principle is enshrined and respected across the immigration detention estate. Doctors should never be involved in disciplinary or non-therapeutic activities within IRCs. \u201cInternational standards of medical ethics make clear that any medical involvement in these measures will be in direct contradiction with the doctor\u2019s primary duty to patients.\u201d the report states. \u201cDoctors should therefore resist formal or informal involvement with centre administration or security tasks, such as the use of force or restraint.\u201d Concerns have been raised about the confidentiality of health records in IRCs, with detainees being asked to consent to their medical records being shared with the Home Office. Commenting on the report, Dr John Chisholm, BMA medical ethics committee chair, said: \u201cMigrants and asylum seekers shouldn\u2019t have their health-related human rights infringed and must be able to access healthcare adequate for their needs. The BMA hopes to work with policymakers and other organisations to restructure and develop policies that meet the health needs of people in detention and ensure doctors can meet their ethical and professional obligations. A fundamental rethink of current policies is required.\u201d Emma Ginn, coordinator of the charity Medical Justice, which works to improve the health of immigration detainees, said: \u201cMedical Justice welcomes the call from the BMA to phase out immigration detention. We agree wholeheartedly and call for immediate action. The BMA\u2019s report echoes concerns we have been raising for over a decade of many disturbing healthcare failures. The Home Office and NHS England would be wise to take heed of such an authoritative voice as the BMA.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cDetention and removal are essential parts of effective immigration controls, especially in support of the removal of those with no lawful basis to stay in the UK. \u201cIt is vital these are carried out with dignity and respect and we take the welfare of our detainees very seriously. We operate on the basis of a presumption against detention, and the adults at risk policy aims to improve our approach to identifying individuals who may be particularly vulnerable to harm in detention. \u201cThe provision of 24-hour, seven-days-a-week healthcare in all immigration removal centres ensures that individuals held there have ready access to medical professionals and levels of primary care in line with individuals in the community.\u201d"
"35||'Addis has run out of space': Ethiopia's radical redesignWrapped in a white shawl and sporting a wide-brimmed cowboy hat, Haile stares out at his cattle as they graze in a rocky patch of grass. \u201cMy family and I have been here since I was a child,\u201d he says, nodding at the small, rickety houses to his right. \u201cBut we will have to leave soon.\u201d In the distance loom hulking grey towers, casting long shadows over his pasture. This is Koye Feche, a vast construction site on the edge of Addis Ababa that may soon be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest housing project. Koye is the latest in a handful of miniature cities that are gobbling up land all around the Ethiopian capital. Since launching the integrated housing and development plan (IHDP) in 2006, the Ethiopian government has built condominium estates like these at a pace unrivalled anywhere in Africa. To date, more more than 250,000 subsidised flats have been transferred to their new owner-occupiers in Addis Ababa and smaller towns. Situated 25km south-east of the city centre and covering over 700 hectares of land, Koye will house more than 200,000 people in row upon row of muscular concrete high-rises. Modelled on the modernist housing estates found across the postwar west, in particular east Germany, Addis Ababa\u2019s condominiums symbolise the vaulting ambition of the Ethiopian government in its efforts to manage the country\u2019s relentless urban growth. But whether they will ever solve its housing problems is uncertain. The population of the capital alone is expected to double to more than 8 million over the next decade. The number of houses needed to meet supply is estimated to be as many as half a million, but nearly a million people languish on the waiting list for a condominium. Nationwide, the urbanisation rate is estimated to be somewhere from 4-6% per year. A slum in the old Piassa neighbourhood of Addis Ababa, slated for demolition As more and more of Ethiopia\u2019s 100 million inhabitants \u2013 80% of whom still live in the countryside \u2013 spill into Addis Ababa, strains on the city\u2019s land have intensified. The consequences may be explosive. \u201cAddis Ababa has run out space,\u201d says Felix Heisel, an urban expert at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. Though the state theoretically owns all land, seizing it from farmers like Haile can cause problems. The \u201cmasterplan\u201d \u2013 shelved last year \u2013 to develop farmland belonging to Oromia, the region that surrounds the capital, was the catalyst for widespread anti-government protests that led to the declaration of a nine-month state of emergency. Expanding the city is for now out of the question. Financed entirely by public resources and without the support of foreign donors, the condominium programme has, however, won its fair share of plaudits. \u201cIt represents a commitment to social housing that is rarely seen in Africa,\u201d says Patrick Lamson-Hall of New York University. \u201cIt shows other African nations that Africa can solve its own problems,\u201d agrees Alazar Ejigu, an Ethiopian architect and urban planner based in Sweden. Left, the half-finished Koye estate; right, the Tilu Dimtu complex, completed two years ago and now housing 10,000 people All construction is carried out by local firms, which means employment for young men like Nibrat, who lays cement on the Koye estate. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to live here myself as I won\u2019t be able to afford the rent,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I like this job and prefer it to farming.\u201d The IHDP is thought to have created semi-skilled jobs for nearly 200,000 men and women since 2006. But it also has plenty of critics, including the World Bank, which considers it fiscally unsustainable. Those who can afford the deposit \u2013 and manage to win the lottery that allocates apartments \u2013 often struggle to pay off the mortgage. More than half, according to Simon Franklin of the London School of Economics, choose to rent the property out and move to places where it is easier to travel to work and find employment, or where social ties are stronger. Older and cheaper apartments in Bole Arabsa The government was \u201ctoo modern, too radical in its approach\u201d, says Ejigu. \u201cThe building design fails to sustain people\u2019s ordinary, traditional way of life.\u201d He and others fear that these European-style constructions breed loneliness and segregation. \u201cIn the informal settlements the rich and poor live side by side,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut the condominiums are socially and economically segregated. The poorest cannot afford to live in them.\u201d The spectre of the many failed, empty high-rises littering the peripheries of cities elsewhere in Africa hangs over Ethiopia\u2019s condominiums \u2013 although, as Franklin notes, there is little sign of the same happening here. New estates quickly become bustling, lively neighbourhoods even while they are still half-finished building sites. \u201cWinning an apartment is an enormous asset,\u201d Franklin says. \u201cIn spite of the common view that no one would want to live in them, their price keeps going up and up.\u201d His research has found that this demand is driven disproportionately by a young, urban professional class. Condominiums being built outside Addis Ababa In Bole Dimtu, a few kilometres east of Koye, thousands of such residents have recently moved in. They include middle-class professionals like Tesfaye, a government employee. He and his family of six used to live in rental housing in the heart of the capital. \u201cI won the lottery,\u201d he beams, cradling his youngest child. \u201cIt\u2019s so much better here. I own this house \u2013 finally I\u2019m not renting.\u201d But there are problems in Bole Dimtu, too. Water has not been running for months and mountains of rubbish pile up in public areas designed to be parks. Merchants sell water cartons from horse-drawn carts. \u201cI need water, I need water,\u201d shouts one woman as they rattle by. A group of condominiums being built on the outskirts of Addis Ababa There is another flipside that worries even the IHDP\u2019s staunchest supporters. Since its inception, the scheme has developed in tandem with a slum clearance programme in Addis Ababa\u2019s inner city. In the past year the pace of demolition has quickened, with 360 hectares and more than 3,000 homes slated to be cleared over the next three years. A revived city centre and business district comprising high-rises of at least nine storeys will replace the old neighbourhoods. It is an \u201cextraordinary high-modernist project\u201d says Franklin. Scenes from a slum in the Addis Ababa\u2019s Piassa neighbourhood, where people are preparing for eviction The centre is slowly being cleansed of its poorer residents, freeing up high-value land for the government to lease to private developers. \u201cThe slum clearance and the condominiums are closely linked,\u201d Franklin explains. \u201cThere seems to be a concerted effort to use the condominiums to suck people out of the centre.\u201d All evicted tenants are offered a condominium apartment, but many cannot afford it. The alternative for homeowners \u2013 financial compensation and a new plot of land \u2013 is often paltry, and usually many miles from their original neighbourhoods. So it is for Tirualem, who has lived with her family of six in a neighbourhood called Piassa for 30 years but was recently told to move so that, she thinks, a nearby hotel can build a swimming pool. She has been promised an apartment in a new condominium estate, 20km away. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the money for a condominium. And there\u2019s no work there. We are moving only because we are forced to.\u201d Farmland and traditional housing next to near-finished modern apartments in Koye, the largest condominium site under construction As Ethiopia\u2019s capital creaks under the weight of its rising population, some are starting to plan for a future outside of Addis Ababa. For the first time, the government\u2019s five-year development plan has a clear urban focus, with efforts being made to promote secondary towns like Hawassa, Bahir Dar and Mekele, in part by linking them to an ambitious network of industrial parks under construction. At the same time it has begun building 1.7m new rural homes across the country. Other schemes are also taking shape. Tsedeke Woldu, an Ethiopian millionaire and construction developer, has drawn up a plan to build 8,000 new towns across the country in partnership with local governments, hoping to stem the tide of urban migration by bringing infrastructure and jobs to rural areas. \u201cWithout efforts like this you can see Addis Ababa eventually being suffocated,\u201d says Zegeye Cherenet, an architect and urban planner. Woldu intends to start work on 13 pilot towns early next year. Will this be enough? Ethiopia has shown that in the face of seemingly insurmountable urban pressures it is possible for even a very poor country to take radical steps. But it also demonstrates their limits: the government\u2019s top-down, authoritarian approach often threatens to be its own undoing. Ethiopia\u2019s government can steamroller grand plans through like few others. But the question is always the same: at what cost?

"0||Government loses vote on New Zealand refugee offer \u2013 as it happenedAnd on that note, we shall call it a night. The government was able to have that vote again, because of a procedure called a recommittal, which basically means Christopher Pyne argued that the vote didn\u2019t properly reflect the chamber\u2019s will. Once the apologies occurred, the chamber had the vote to have the vote and by that time the government had the numbers and then won the vote. And it was the Greens motion, which Labor supported (it was moved by Adam Bandt) I\u2019ve been informed it is actually about the fifth time the government has lost a vote in the House of Representatives. No wonder Malcolm Turnbull didn\u2019t look happy. The marriage equality debate will continue tonight before being picked up again tomorrow. At this stage, the house will run out of time to vote on it by the end of the sitting week, if all the speakers stay on the list and then the amendments are dealt with. We shall see. Milo Yiannopoulos will speak to any interested MPs and staff in one of the parliament function/dining rooms tomorrow, at the invitation of David Leyonhjelm. Yay. We should get to banning foreign donations sometime in the near future. As soon as the government finishes dealing with bills it makes a priority, in this case, the superannuation changes, and then filibusters on and then pulls from the priority list when the crossbench support seemingly dissipates, in the Senate. And we have more citizenship saga to look forward to. How members will be referred is still being worked out but the government is not ruling out using its numbers (plus a crossbencher) to force opposition referrals. That has some way to play out. Oh, and be prepared to never want to hear the word \u201cBennelong\u201d again. Because the government is going to use every opportunity it has (read: dixer) to talk about that byelection. (And for those wondering, there is still no official Queensland election result. This is going to take some time, as the Election Commission Queensland are now making their way through postal votes) But in the meantime, congratulations on making it through Monday! And for helping me through it! For those asking, it doesn\u2019t look as though Barnaby Joyce will be back in the parliament anytime before at least Thursday, which means the government is going to be short on the numbers for a few days more. That makes Bob Katter\u2019s vote with the government pretty important today. Make sure you watch for that. The biggest of thank yous to Mike Bowers and please make sure you check out his Twitter and Instagram for more of today\u2019s insanity. As always, thank you to the Guardian Australia brains trust for all their help and typo catching (which are always just mine) and again to you, for reading, tweeting, and playing along. Even those of you who seemed a bit cranky today. We have three (scheduled) days left and I promise you we will get through them. I\u2019ll see you back here just after 8am tomorrow for more fun and games. Have a wonderful night. The unavoidably detained Steve Ciobo We have had the final divide and the motion was voted down, 74-73. It is at this point that Labor would like to remind you that Anthony Albanese didn\u2019t lose a vote in the three years he oversaw a (minority) government\u2019s business. This is either the third or fourth time this has happened to this government. Which includes one in the first week of the 45th parliament. A nice bookend then. See what I mean about the mood? That feeling when you lose a vote the first day back after suspending parliament the week before. (That\u2019s Bob Katter siding with the government there.) So much being said in one photo: Tony Smith wants the two who missed the vote to explain why they missed the vote. Steve Ciobo apologises for missing it. \u201cI was unfortunately detained and not able to get here on time,\u201d he says. If I had known that was all you had to say, my teen years would have been a lot easier. Warren Entsch also apologises and says it was \u201cmembers\u2019 misadventure\u201d. Smith says they have confirmed they did not deliberately miss the vote and calls the divide again. From my perusal of that list, Steve Ciobo looks like he was the other missing MP. Actually, we must have had two missing persons. I\u2019m guessing Warren Entsch may have been one, as he was on Sky. Working on finding out who the second one was. Back in the House, the chamber just had a division to agree with a Senate resolution to accept the New Zealand offer to settle refugees in Australia\u2019s offshore detention centres. It was won 73 to 72. Christopher Pyne is calling for the House to divide again, which is just code for someone missed the division. So the government lost the vote. But is calling for another one. Speaking to David Speers on Sky, Warren Entsch is making the argument to keep any amendments to the marriage equality legislation separate from the legislation itself. He says the inquiry the government has set up (led by Philip Ruddock) is the place for anything else to be considered but he also believes that as time moves on \u201ca lot of the fear will dissipate\u201d. The Greens have put forward a motion condemning \u201cthe offensive behaviour of alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos, as well as any senator who seeks to use parliament to provide a platform for the hate, abuse or harassment of women, Jews and members of the LGBTIQ and multicultural communities.\u201d From Richard Di Natale\u2019s statement: The Senate today condemned the despicable behaviour of Milo Yiannopoulos and any senator, like Senator David Leyonhjelm, who seeks to use the Australian parliament to provide a platform for people who preach hate and incite abuse and harassment of minority groups. Milo Yiannopoulos is a white supremacist, a paedophilia apologist and a shameless self-promoter completely lacking in moral character. He aims to lower our political discourse into the sewer and turn neighbour against neighbour for the sake of his own bank account. It is a disgrace that Senator David Leyonhjelm is bringing him to our parliament. Our parliament should be a place that celebrates the diversity of our community, not one where peddlers of hate are given a platform to preach their abuse. Unfortunately the parliament\u2019s presiding officers declined the Greens\u2019 call to revoke his permission to speak here, which would have been the appropriate action. But we do commend the ALP and the Senate crossbench for standing with us and refusing to let hate go unchecked. At this stage, it doesn\u2019t look like we will have an answer on citizenship referrals or an end to the marriage equality legislation debate by the end of the week. This could change, and very quickly, but right now time is not on our side. As you can imagine, the mood is not overly festive in this place right now. That photo Labor used in question time has spilled over onto Twitter, with Labor and the Coalition playing a strange sort of pictionary game: As mentioned a little bit ago, the speakers list is now up to 102 people on the marriage equality bill. As Lane Sainty points out, this is going to have ramifications ... Over in the Senate ... The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, asked the attorney general, George Brandis, a series of questions a while ago about a vague donation to the NSW Liberal party from controversial Chinese billionaire businessman Huang Xiangmo. Di Natale: Malcolm Turnbull reportedly hinted at a probe into Labor senator Sam Dastyari\u2019s dealing with businessman Huang Xiangmo, someone who intelligence experts believe was, until recently, part of a global campaign run by the Chinese Communist party to advance China\u2019s interests overseas. Since 2012, Mr Huang has donated almost $3m to both sides of politics, but, importantly, on 27 September 2017, some two years after Asio had briefed both the Liberal and Labor parties about the threat of taking donations from Mr Huang, an amended return was lodged with the Australian Electoral Commission by the NSW Liberal party, which reveals a $44,000 payment from Mr Huang. Minister, what\u2019s the purpose of this payment? And, given the prime minister\u2019s concerns, will you now commit to repaying the money? Brandis responded: Well, Senator Di Natale. First of all. We don\u2019t ever speculate upon investigations. That little opener led to guffaws from the opposition bench. The Senate president, Scott Ryan, had to bring the chamber to order. Brandis continued: Senator Di Natale, I have actually reviewed the transcript of the prime minister\u2019s remarks this morning and, in my view, it is not a fair or indeed an available construction of anything he said to suggest that he hinted, even hinted, at the existence of an investigation. In addressing these matters, what I have said is that certain matters have been credibly alleged by reputable journalists against Senator Dastyari and that is undoubtedly true. But I will not comment on, nor will the prime minister or any minister, comment on, confirm, or for that matter deny, the existence of an investigation.\u201d Di Natale then asked Brandis to return to the point of his question. Will the Liberal Party commit to repaying the $44,000 donation from Mr Huang? Brandis said: I don\u2019t know the details of that donation but I can assure you that the Liberal party is compliant with all of its disclosure obligations under the commonwealth electoral act. All electoral parties receive donations from business people. My side of politics does, the Labor party does. The Greens do. And there is no prohibition on business people donating to political parties just because they are Chinese. Di Natale said he just wanted to know if the Liberal party would repay the $44,000 donation. Brandis replied: What is alleged against Senator Dastyari has nothing whatsoever to do with the disclosure of donations, it has to do with other matters, as you\u2019re aware. George Christensen has weighed in on the penalty rate amendments Labor forced onto the Fair Work bill: Time for some Mike Bowers magic: Back in the Senate and George Brandis is now arguing to remove the superannuation bills as a priority. Labor had attempted to do that last week and failed. So, I guess we can take that as a given that the government no longer has the numbers for all the moving parts on those ones. Tanya Plibersek is up again with another question on the NBN: Last week, the NBN announced it was halting the HFC rollout of the second-rate NBN. Can the prime minister outline just how many millions of dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money is being wasted by this latest failure? Malcolm Turnbull: I can tell the honourable member that there are billions and billions of dollars being saved by not doing the NBN in the way the Labor party had proposed to do and, of course, between such \u2013 $30bn in savings and six to eight years in terms of time to complete it. The reality is that the NBN is one of the fastest rollouts of a telecom network, ever. It is extraordinary. 40,000 premises being activated just about every week. Now, Mr Speaker, what we\u2019ve seen, I gave some figures just a moment ago, is 6.5 million premises as of the last published data, are available to be connected right now. So that\u2019s so people can sign up and get hooked up now, and there\u2019s three and a quarter million paying customers right now. Of course, like any big rollout like that, it has challenges in some areas. What the NBN is doing, is ensuring with respect to HFC, it\u2019s making sure the technology works well. It is a complex business rolling out this network, they\u2019re doing an outstanding job and making sure they put the customer experience first.\u201d And after working himself up in to a lather, he puts further questions on notice and question time is over. While that Dixer is going on and my will to live is dripping out of my fingers, an update on the speaking list for the marriage equality legislation. There are now 102 speakers listed. Out of an eligible 147. Labor \u2013 57/69 MPs (50 to go) Coalition \u2013 41 out of 73 (34 to go) Crossbench \u2013 4/5 (Katter is not on the list) We now have a total of 102 speakers listed (out of a potential pool of 147 \u2013 minus Speaker, Alexander and Barnaby) ALP 57/69 (with 50 still to go) Govt 41/73 with 34 still to go Cross 4/5 (No Katter) So 88 to go. So far, the average speaking time has been just under 15 minutes. A Dixer for Scott Morrison on what the government is doing in regards of tax cuts, including for the people of Bennelong. Sigh. Tanya Plibersek has another question on the NBN HFC delay: \u201cCan the prime minister confirm he first became aware of the problems back in 2015 and did he take any actions?\u201d He is taking it on notice. Another Dixer, now on Medicare, from Greg Hunt. Who makes it a whole minute before mentioning Bennelong and Kristina Keneally. My liver is lucky this is not a drinking game. Another Dixer aimed at attacking Kristina Keneally. Anyone would think the battle for Bennelong is bothering the government. Bill Shorten also wants to talk about Bennelong and what is happening with the NBN there. The prime minister and John Alexander promised voters in Bennelong before the last election that they\u2019d all have NBN now. But last week NBN announced it will delay the rollout to 40,000 premises. Why do those 40,000 premises now have to wait even later. If John Alexander couldn\u2019t even deliver on his last promise, why should the voters in Bennelong believe him now? Malcolm Turnbull (after attacking Keneally\u2019s infrastructure record while premier). Out of the, I think, 3.3 million customers that have got the NBN now activated, there\u2019s well over 6 million premises that have got it available. It\u2019s on track to be available to around three-quarters of Australian households this coming year, Mr Speaker, and the company has said it\u2019s on track to be completed in accordance with their schedule by 2020. So the project is under way. The rollout on the hybrid fibre coaxial network has experienced some technical difficulties and what they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve delayed it ... delayed it or paused it so as to get those difficulties sorted out. Peter Dutton takes a Dixer designed to attack Kristina Keneally. Who, last time I checked, was not in parliament. Then we move on to Mark Dreyfus who asks: My question is to the prime minister. I refer to Labor introducing a bill to parliament to ban foreign political donations over a year ago and I also refer to reports in the Daily Telegraph that Mr Huang\u2019s right-hand man is campaigning for Liberal candidate and former MP John Alexander in Bennelong. What else have Mr Huang and his associates given to the Liberals to help keep the prime minister in his job and is this one of the reasons why the prime minister has delayed banning political foreign donations for over a year? Speaker Tony Smith only rules the part of the question dealing with policy (foreign donations) in order. \u201cThe foreign donations legislation will be introduced into the House this week,\u201d the PM says. Malcolm Turnbull then starts talking about Sam Dastyari and Tony Burke points out part of the question was ruled out of order and the prime minister can\u2019t address it. So, we move on. Christopher Pyne gets a Dixer designed to let the government talk more on Sam Dastyari. We move on to Tony Burke who asks about where the information regarding Dastyari came from, without actually mentioning Dastyari: On Wednesday and Thursday Fairfax reported two stories on national security. The attorney general even confirmed that national security information should never find its way into the hands into the media but it has. Has the government ordered any investigation into what the attorney general has admitted a leak of national security information and who had possession of that information among ministers and their staff? Malcolm Turnbull: The honourable member omitted one important fact which was the information he is describing as having been referred to in the Fairfax press apparently, it was something on Wednesday and Thursday. Now, is he talking about Senator Dastyari ... is that right? No, OK, very, good. He\u2019s referred to Senator Dastyari\u2019s, he\u2019s referred to Senator Dastyari and the \u2013 my observation is very simply this, that leaks of national security information should never occur, full stop. Now, if the honourable member is alleging that a security agency was responsible for putting information into the press, then he should make that allegation. Burke interrupts to say that Turnbull is answering a question that wasn\u2019t asked. The Speaker allows it and Turnbull finishes: If the honourable member wants to ask me a question about information published in the Fairfax press, or anywhere else, then he should actually spell out what this information is,because he has, in some rather coy way, failed to actually describe it, which makes me think it might have something to do with a certain senator. The senator whose name, apparently, cannot be mentioned by the Labor party. Let me say this to the honourable member \u2013 if you\u2019re not prepared to name him, you shouldn\u2019t be prepared to keep him in the Senate. Again, Labor can\u2019t sack Dastyari from the Senate, only disendorse him. Also, how many questions on national security information appearing in the media does the prime minister take that he needs names to be able to answer ... oh, that\u2019s right. Politics. Rebekha Sharkie has the independents\u2019 question and wants to know when the government will action the findings of the royal commission, which included the Don Dale investigation: Malcolm Turnbull: My government will now consider the recommendations made in the report and with the Northern Territory government, in respect of whose activities most of the recommendations apply to, key stakeholders and communities, to form the development of our response. Now, most of the recommendations, as I noted, are matters for the Northern Territory government. The Australian government will now also carefully consider the findings that are directed to the commonwealth. We have already committed to ratifying the optional protocol to the convention against torture will ensure that oversight of places of detention, including youth detention, is strengthened in the Northern Territory and of course everywhere else. Mr Speaker, when children are safe, the whole community benefits as well. This is our greatest obligation, to look after our children, we understand that. All children deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, all children deserve to be safe and that\u2019s the responsibility of the whole community and, importantly, of course, families and government agencies. Now, I want to make a note I observe to the honourable member\u2019s benefit, an observation about funding. I quote from the royal commission here. The commissioners wrote: \u2018A consistent theme heard by the commission was that there is insufficient funding in the Northern Territory to address the issues it\u2019s grappling with. However, having reviewed financial data available to the commission, the commission considers it is underlying problem is not the level of overall funding but that commonwealth and Northern Territory government investment is not rigorously tracked, monitored or evaluated to ensure that it\u2019s appropriately distributed and directed. Value for the money expended cannot be demonstrated. The major investment in Aboriginal affairs over many years has delivered mixed success, often with dismally poor returns. A combination of underperforming programs, poor coordination across governments and a lack of engagement with Aboriginal people in the design and delivery of services is producing continually poor results. The approach must be changed.\u2019 Now, we absolutely recognise the force of that observation. As you know in 2017-2018, the Northern Territory government will receive $4.2bn from the commonwealth. We are determined to ensure that every dollar that we spend on Indigenous affairs [and] Indigenous welfare delivers the outcome [we need]. So I thank the honourable member for her question. It is a very important question. Back in the House and it is a Dixer. Scott Morrison tries to appear enthused. Then on to Chris Bowen. He wants to know about Phil Coorey\u2019s report in the Fin about the banks expecting the royal commission, and that the terms were \u201cworked out\u201d a long time ago because \u201cit was inevitable\u201d. \u201cSo why was the treasurer kept in the dark for so long?\u201d Morrison: The terms of reference for the inquiry and the announcement of the royal commission into the banking sector was made at nine, Mr Speaker, on that day and that was the first that the banks and others were aware that this government was going to put a royal commission in place. There is no doubt, Mr Speaker, that the government over a period of time had been aware of the various arguments that had been put in place. Indeed, the arguments being put by the opposition over two-and-a-half years, which I note over all that period of time they called for a royal commission for the banks they never came up with the terms of reference, not once, Mr Speaker. Not once, not once did they come up with the terms of reference yet they were the ones that wanted to announce a royal commission into the banks, Mr Speaker. So, to my knowledge, and the minister for revenue\u2019s and the prime minister\u2019s acknowledge, that Treasury has been working into the terms of reference but at the end of the day the decision to go forward with a banking royal commission was made. But the recklessness of the leader of the opposition and the shadow treasurer for over two years calling into question the security of the financial sector, on which the entire economy depends. It was the point of their recklessness that required to government to take control over the situation and that\u2019s what we have did. They have demonstrated a reckless behaviour towards the economy. If they put ever got to put that into office, it would be a shocker. Over in the Senate, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, is asking George Brandis about a $44,000 donation the Liberal party received from Huang Xiangmo sometime in the 2015-16 election year, which doesn\u2019t appear to have been declared until recently: Di Natale: \u201cQuestion is to the leader of the government representing the prime minister: 1. On 27 September 2017, some two years after Asio had briefed Liberal and Labor parties about the threat of taking donations from Mr Huang for being closely linked to the Chinese government, an amended political party disclosure return was lodged with the AEC by the NSW Liberal party. Because our donations laws encourage secrecy, the public don\u2019t know what the $44,000 provided by Mr Huang\u2019s Yuhu Group and Mandarin International Investment was for. It is simply listed as \u2018other receipt\u2019. What was the purpose of this payment? A few tables at Liberal fundraising dinners? Free rent? Please inform the Senate of its precise purpose. 2. Can the government assure the Australian people that no foreign donations, \u2018other receipts\u2019, or in-kind support such as Yuhu Group employee Tim Xu campaigning for Mr Alexander will have made their way into the Bennelong byelection campaign and that any such donation or payment will also be returned? 3. The government and opposition\u2019s response to the Senator Dastyari and Mr Huang controversy has deftly sidestepped the deeper problem lying at the very heart of this scandal and our entire democracy \u2013 that political influence can be bought, especially without an ICAC. Whether they are foreign sourced, from corporations, unions or wealthy individuals \u2013 big donations create a sense of obligation or generosity to the donor. With this in mind, will the government examine strict caps for political donations across the board, no matter where it comes from? Amended donation declaration: http://periodicdisclosures.aec.gov.au/Returns/60/VQRP9A02.pdf Brandis says he doesn\u2019t know the details of the donation. Tony Burke is next with a question for Malcolm Turnbull: I refer to the photograph of Mr Huang, which was published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 12 February 2016. Can the prime minister please identify the person on the right? Spoiler \u2013 it is the prime minister. I\u2019m delighted to get that question. I really am. Because it shows the desperation of the Labor party. Their desperation, so desperately trying to spread, blow some smoke around and cover up the intimate relationship between Senator Dastyari and, so it would seem, the leader of the opposition. So they have a photograph with me at an event in a public street in Sydney. Hooray for that. What a revelation. If you had had a wider-angle lens, you could have got the other 5,000 people that were there as well. What we really need to know is this: What did the leader of the opposition say to Senator Dastyari directly or indirectly that prompted him, Senator Dastyari, to go to Mr Huang\u2019s house, the house that the leader of the opposition had visited and knew well, to go to Mr Huang\u2019s house and tell him how to avoid surveillance activities by Asio? The leader of the opposition has got to tell us that. He hasn\u2019t. First Dixer. Just how amazing is this government (is the general gist) particularly when it comes to cost of living? Oh so very amazing, says the prime minister. Actually, the most amazing. Rinse and repeat. Question time! First up is Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull: Can the prime minister confirm that since the House last sat five weeks ago, he has cancelled parliament, ruled out a banking royal commission, then announced a banking royal commission, halted the NBN rollout for 2 million households, had cabinet ministers calling for investigations into each other over cabinet leaks and been accused by his own backbenchers of a failure of leadership. When will the prime minister admit he has lost control of his government and lost authority as prime minister? Turnbull: The Labor party put in a strong showing comfortably ahead of the informal vote, just got into double figures. Barnaby Joyce\u2019s swing was larger than the Labor party\u2019s primary vote. It only happened on Saturday but I\u2019m not surprised the leader of the opposition has blotted it out of his memory. One of the things that has occurred over the last five weeks that the leader of the opposition should not blot out of his memory is what advice he gave to Sam Dastyari. Before he met with Mr Huang. The leader of the opposition should not easily forget Mr Huang because he visited him at his house last year. He has a very good familiarity with the gentleman. Mr Speaker, the leader of the opposition remembers very well the function that he attended on 17 June with Senator Dastyari, with Mr Huang and then, shortly after that, Senator Dastyari had a press conference with Mr Huang. In the media briefing room at the commonwealth parliamentary office in Sydney. There are two lecterns there, two podiums. Each of them has the Australian coat of arms. Dastyari stood at one. Mr Huang stood at the other. Senator Dastyari stood at one and Mr Huang at the other. Senator Dastyari said these words, apparently written for him by someone else, \u201cThe South China Sea is China\u2019s own affair\u201d. This came after Mr Huang paid off debts for Senator Dastyari. It reads like talking points from the Global Times in Beijing. That\u2019s what it was. Senator Dastyari contradicting Australian government policy, Labor party policy, on the South China Sea. He got sacked for that. But then, then, perhaps the leader of the opposition, as he trolls through the last five weeks, could remember what advice he gave Senator Dastyari that prompted him to tell Mr Huang how to avoid surveillance by Asio. The House is dealing with condolence motions. In the Senate, George Brandis said he had never heard of the NSW deputy premier, John Barilaro (that broad church must be very broad indeed) until Friday and said his comments (you know, the ones where he said the prime minister needed to step down for the good of the nation) were the rants of \u201can obscure politician who no one outside of NSW has heard of\u201d. Count down to question time is on. In the words of Taylor Swift, are you ready for it? Over in the Senate and the superannuation debate appears to be going well, if \u201cby well\u201d you mean the government appears to be filibustering its own bill. Labor has no further speakers but government senators have many, many things to say about super, which has some speculating it may have some problems with crossbench support for the part of the bill that seeks to change the governance structures of super boards. \u201cPolitically correct bigotry\u201d is emerging as a late contender for this year\u2019s T-shirt competition. Arthur Sinodinos has taken to Twitter to update his citizenship declaration with a document that was missing from his official citizenship declaration. The marriage equality legislation debate has been suspended (House timetables and all that) and the chamber has moved on to members\u2019 statements, in the lead-up to question time. Cathy O\u2019Toole is up first and she is congratulating Annastacia Palaszczuk on her election win (almost) with Labor inching towards 47 seats and a majority in the Queensland one-house parliament. The ECQ is still counting tens of thousands of postal votes, there are still preferences to be distributed (and those preferences have been all over the place, so it has made it very difficult to predict) and Labor won\u2019t be declaring victory until the seats are declared by the commission. For those playing along at home, the LNP have still not conceded for the same reason. There has been a lot of interest in this election (especially from me, because it\u2019s my old patch, but also because it has been fascinating) and you can watch the seat results here. Seats like Maiwar are particularly interesting \u2013 a handful of votes will decide them. The La Trobe MP Jason Wood says he used to \u201cstand very proudly in firm opposition\u201d to same-sex marriage, despite the protests outside his office, the angry emails and former colleagues in the police service criticising his decision. He said he then met some youth from his electorate, who told him about the rates of homosexual men taking their lives because of a lack of acceptance and a conversation with a friend in a same-sex relationship, who simply told him \u201cI would love to get married\u201d. \u201cI love Anna and want to marry her,\u201d his friend said when he asked why. He then began meeting same-sex couples and families in his electorate \u201cand for the first time I started to see that my views on same-sex marriage were causing great sadness to others\u201d. \u201cI then realises it was time for me to seriously rethink this issue \u2026 following that, which I did, I decided to support same-sex marriage\u201d. There will be cynicism to this view, I know. But I also think that it is a positive thing when our politicians make an effort to change their views. Anthony Albanese finishes his speech by mentioning something that has been left out a little in this debate, the idea that a child needs two parents to be part of a complete family. Albanese, raised by a single mother, said every time he heard that, \u201cwhat I hear is intolerance, what I hear is that, somehow, some families are better than others\u201d. \u201cWhat matters in a family is love and care,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat matters in a family is love, it is is simple as that and no other family arrangement is better than another.\u201d Anthony Albanese says he is \u201cvery proud\u201d to support the legislation \u2013 but notes that the parliament is not leading but following in this instance. He is not supporting any of the amendments and says he has argued for it to be a conscience vote \u201cbut the fact is that people\u2019s religious freedom will not be impacted by this legislation, just as the institution of marriage will not be undermined.\u201d He also paid tribute to Paul O\u2019Grady and those who marched in the first mardi gras, towards police, in 1978. You can follow along with the bill\u2019s progression here Tony Abbott has moved amendments on the marriage equality bill. I would like this to be a unifying moment for our country. And the best way to make this a unifying moment for our country would be to acknowledge the continuing concerns that many decent Australians have about freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of religion and parental rights. The best way to make this a unifying moment for our country would be to ensure that the anti-gay prejudice of the past is not replaced by s new politically correct bigotry. We certainly do not want new forms of division to replace old ones. I believe that the passage of the bill, as amended, will enable our country to go forward together, united in decency and in respect for the rights of all. Now, Mr Speaker, I certainly do not pretend to be an overnight convert to supporting same-sex marriage but I pledged to respect and facilitate the verdict of the Australian people. Same-sex marriage should now be recognised. It will now be recognised. There should be a clear distinction between how marriage is understood by the church and marriage as recognised by the state and, on that basis, I looking forward to attending the marriage of my sister, Christine, to her partner Virginia early in the new year. Katy Gallagher is not in parliament today \u2013 she\u2019s with her child in hospital. She has put a statement out on Facebook in regards to her citizenship issue (she remained a dual citizen until a month after the election). Labor MP Warren Snowdon tells the chamber he is a Catholic but \u201cthis is a matter of equality, not faith\u201d. He thanks Warren Entsch for the work he has done. There has been a lot of cross-party thanks given today. Malcolm Turnbull did not single out any opposition MPs. But he did take the time to say this: Previous governments have failed to take it on. The Labor party did nothing about it for six years in power. Now with a strong message from the Australian people which my government enabled, the way is clear. For those wondering, Bill Shorten did say a cross-chamber thank you Now this legislation will bear Senator [Dean] Smith\u2019s signature and that is a worthy tribute to his patience and hard work down the years. And to his Liberal and conservative colleagues who stood up to be counted, you know who you are, you know what you did and what you have accomplished. Scott Morrison is speaking on the marriage equality bill now. He has a lot to say about the separation of church and state. You just can\u2019t help but think that if parliament hadn\u2019t been suspended last week, we would be voting on this now. And then Turnbull\u2019s speech took a slightly strange turn: Codependency is a good thing ... and gay people are better off together then living alone comforted only by their respective cats. Last one, because it will probably be the last nice moment we have in this place this week. Prepare for the amendment debate. Here is why Malcolm Turnbull says he will be supporting amendments to the bill (which he admitted last week): There is nothing in the bill which prevents anyone from maintaining or adhering to the teaching of their church on marriage or morality. But we must not fail to recognise that there is sincere heartfelt anxiety about the bill\u2019s impact on religious freedom. And that is why I will support amendments to the bill which will provide the additional reassurance and respect of these fundamental rights and freedoms. Turnbull has made a point of making this known: I am the first prime minister of Australia to be unequivocally and consistently in support of legalising same-sex marriage. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is speaking on the marriage equality bill. I am very firmly of the view that families are the foundation of our society and would be a stronger society if more people were married and by that I mean formally, legally married and fewer were divorced. If consulted by friends about marital dramas I always encouraged the singles to marry, the married to stick together and the neglectful to renew their commitment and the wronged to forgive. I am utterly unpersuaded by opposition [to marriage equality] that my marriage to Lucy or indeed any marriage is undermined by two gay men or women setting up house down the road whether it is called a marriage or not. Let\u2019s be honest with each other, the threat to traditional marriage is not from gay people but a lack of loving commitment, whether found in the form of neglect, indifference, cruelty or adultery to name just a few manifestations of that loveless desert in which to many marriages come to grief. If the threat to marry today is lack of commitment, then surely other couples making and maintaining that commitment is as good example rather than a bad one. Speaking of citizenship, Katy Gallagher appears to have been a dual citizen until after the election. I doubt she is the only one who is going to be relying on the \u201creasonable steps\u201d argument, as this train continues down the track. We go on to the Senate citizenship disclosures. Just back to the Senate and the penalty rates amendment, here is what Brendan O\u2019Connor had to say in a statement: Labor\u2019s amendment to reverse the cuts to penalty rates and protect penalty rates in the future has successfully passed the Senate this morning. Turnbull and his Liberals are so emphatically against penalty rates that they voted against their own bill \u2013 the Fair Work Amendment (Repeal of 4 Yearly Reviews and Other Measures) Bill 2017 \u2013 after we forced the government to bring it on for debate. The government voted against protecting penalty rates, because they support wage cuts for 700,000 workers. One Nation voted against protecting penalty rates by voting with the government and against the bill at the third reading stage. Now the heat is on George Christensen to see whether or not he will cave into his Canberra masters or remain loyal to his commitment to his electorate to stop cuts to penalty rates. Turnbull and his Liberals have a callous disregard for Australian workers and this was on display in the Senate today. Just how out of touch can this government get? Under the Turnbull government we are headed to a low-wage, easy-to-hire, easy-to-fire society. Champagne all round The mea culpa continues There are at least 77 speakers on the marriage equality bill. But this is what everyone is talking about at the moment: For those wondering about the speakers, here is the list so far: The ACCC will start its inquiry into Facebook and Google. From its release: The ACCC\u2019s inquiry will look at the effect that digital search engines, social media platforms and other digital content aggregation platforms are having on competition in media and advertising services markets. \u201cThe ACCC goes into this inquiry with an open mind to and will study how digital platforms such as Facebook and Google operate to fully understand their influence in Australia,\u201d ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said. \u201cWe will examine whether platforms are exercising market power in commercial dealings to the detriment of consumers, media content creators and advertisers. The ACCC will look closely at longer-term trends and the effect of technological change on competition in media and advertising. We will also consider the impact of information asymmetry between digital platform providers and advertisers and consumers. You\u2019ll find more on that here The Nationals party room met this morning, where they celebrated Barnaby Joyce\u2019s byelection victory. They just invited the media into their party room so Joyce could say thank you to New England voters, via the television camera. An ebullient Joyce, who was wearing a visitor\u2019s pass (he doesn\u2019t have official access yet to Parliament House), reminded everyone in the room that they shouldn\u2019t take for granted that they can work in the building. \u201cWhat an incredible honour it is to be able to walk through the door without one of these things on,\u201d he said, tugging his pass. \u201cDon\u2019t take it for granted. Treasure it. And note that every day is almost a sacred duty you have, the Australian people give you a sacred responsibility, and we have to earn it, and re-earn it, every day we come in here.\u201d He said his re-election proved that New England voters liked what the Nationals stood for, while his time on the campaign trail reminded him that voters will not support politicians in Canberra who lose touch with their electorate. He extended a non-partisan-but-still-obviously-partisan hand to the Greens, saying at least they \u201cfessed up\u201d about colleagues of theirs who were were found to be ineligible to sit in parliament, due to their citizenship status, just like Nationals MPs had done, and unlike Labor. \u201cBill Shorten, it says something about you \u2026 that even to this day you have given us all of these slippery words, you know full well that you have people in your party who have questions to answer and you should have put them out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could have been all these byelections on the one day but you didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Tim Wilson cries as he proposes to Ryan Bolger, again, who is sitting in the gallery. Ryan gives a very enthusiastic yes and it is marked in the Hansard. Mark Dreyfus offers his congratulations before giving his speech. Liberal MP Tim Wilson is talking about his engagement to his partner, Ryan. He tells how he told one person who said \u201cwhy bother?\u201d, and did not want to throw an engagement party as he thought the muted reaction he received from those who he told meant no one would come. But he says the survey have answered the question for him and the result shows \u201cthe Australia we want to be\u201d. Quick trip to the Senate, where Labor\u2019s amendment to reverse the penalty rates cut got up 35 to 26, which meant the government had to vote against its own bill. Labor MPs went over to pay homage to Penny Wong and Louise Pratt following Bill Shorten\u2019s speech. But there is a lot of cross-party support here as well. Terri Butler gave Trent Zimmerman\u2019s shoulder a squeeze as she walked by. Liberal MPs are also stopping by to chat to Dean Smith and George Brandis. A little more from Bill Shorten\u2019s speech and then I\u2019ll grab some of Mike Bowers\u2019 pictures for you. I think this is an uplifting moment in our nation but we need to be mindful to match our joy without humility. Humility to acknowledge on so long on marriage equality, Australia has trailed the world. The humility to seek forgiveness from LGBTQI Australians, forgiveness I speak of the long delay but the injustices and the indignities are both great and small. Forgiveness for subjecting you and your relationships to public judgment. Forgiveness for the hurt and harm you and your families have suffered. We seek your forgiveness, we salute your courage and we thank you for including us in your historic moment. And, let me be clear, in voting for marriage equality, the campaigners for marriage equality have not just delivered equality for them, they have made the Australian identity better. The gift of this legislation is not just in allowing people to get married, the gift of the legislation is it says Australia can be a better place, a more inclusive place. I want to say to all these LGBTQI Australians who found themselves for subsequent days examining the result, seeing it as some kind of reflection on them in percentage terms, let me declare this. You are not 61% anything, you are 100% equal, 100% loved and you are 100% right to live your life the way you want and we are lucky to count each and every one of you as our fellow Australians. This law is not the end of the ancient institution of marriage. It is a new beginning for a more equal world. In a generation to come, I hope and imagine that Australians will look back to these days and this debate and most will wonder what was the fuss all about. My children will attend the weddings of their friends and not give a moment\u2019s thought to whether they are gay or straight, whether it is in a church or a park. All that will matter is do the couple love each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together. All that will matter is that they are people like us, our friends, neighbours, our family members, our loved ones, our fellow Australians. This moment, this debate, this week, belongs to all those who have waited. This moment belongs to all those who have fought. It belongs to all those who did not live to see their dream realised, it belongs to those who have felt that inequality in the law has meant they are unequal in our eyes. We have come too late to this moment but we are here at last. Today is an outstanding day when we vote on this bill will be an outstanding moment. It will be, I predict, an uplifting moment. So it is with joy, with humility, with privilege, with love for our brothers and sisters and, with hope in our future, I commenced this bill to the house. Katharine Murphy is in the chamber and reports that Labor is out in force for Shorten\u2019s speech. Penny Wong and Louise Pratt are also in the chamber. The other side of the chamber is looking a little bare. We count Warren Entsch, Trent Zimmerman, Trevor Evans, Tim Wilson and a couple of other Liberals. Oh, and Tony Abbott. Bill Shorten is now speaking on the bill. This is a chance for our parliament to demonstrate that we are worthy of the people that we serve. A chance to honour the courage of LGBTIQ Australians to recognise our rights and celebrate our love. It is a chance to atone for the inaction and failures of the past. After years of discrimination, disappointment and delay, to write into law a truth that we know in our hearts. Marriage is defined by love and loyalty, not gender. And while this final legal change depends on the overdue vote of our parliament, today is not actually about the parliamentarians. For me today, it is about the teenager in the country town who stood in front of his footy club, asked his teammates to support him to be the person that he has always been. Today is about an office worker in the city who challenged her colleagues to put aside their old thoughtless prejudices and respect her right to equality. Today is about tens of thousands of loving same-sex couples who prove every day that they are wonderful parents, parents raising brilliant kids ... Today belongs to all the LGBTIQ Australians who have borne the burden of a long battle for equality. Some of whom could deservedly be described as proud warriors who remember when their very existence was considered to be a criminal offence but always knew it was the law that had to change and not their love. The Brisbane MP Trevor Evans also seems to point to not wanting amendments in his speech on the bill. Brisbane voted yes overwhelmingly \u2013 79.5%. I was at the Brisbane Pride ball this year, where Evans was heckled as he gave his speech in support of marriage equality, while part of a government which was then blocking it. He took the heckles then but seems very pleased to be able to deliver this speech today. This is a bill that finds a good balance between the need to protect important religious freedoms while still implementing the clear will of the Australian people to change the marriage act to allow same-sex couples to marry. This bill contains specific protections for religious organisations, it contains protections for individual ministers of religion, even if they are acting outside the tenants of that organised religion. It contains protections for the civil celebrants and four chaplains and for businesses and organisations and other bodies if they are set up probably for religious purposes ... I accept that not all religious organisations agree with this bill, and nor do all of the gay advocacy groups, but this bill does have the blessing of many of the religious organisations and gay advocacy groups that are capable of reaching agreement on this matter. This bill has the support because it doesn\u2019t open any new forms of discrimination and equally, it does not remove any religious freedoms or protections. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, it is with pride and joy and love that I second this bill. It is a good bill. It strikes a good balance and it enjoys wide support across our community. Now that the Brisbane community and the broader Australian community has voiced its strong support to the same-sex marriage, it is time for us in this parliament to do all bit. This week, in the businesslike fashion. I second this bill. George Brandis is also in the House. For those asking, Barnaby Joyce is in the party room, not yet the parliament. And yes, he is considered a \u201cvisitor\u201d. The Fairfax-Ipsos poll was also published today. It reported the same 53 to 47 result to Labor. It also found that 71 per cent of respondents do not think the prime minister should be rolled. Which just makes me wonder what the other respondents were thinking, and whether they had paid any attention over the last seven years or so. TFW you are just wondering what John Wayne would do As my colleague Paul Karp just pointed out, there are a lot of MPs on the speaking list for this one. A lot. I think the predictions we won\u2019t see a vote on this until at least Wednesday night is correct. Senator Dean Smith is in the House watching as Entsch speaks on the bill. Entsch seems a little choked up. It has been a long time coming for him, as he said, and he makes a point of saying he doesn\u2019t believe the \u201creligious freedom\u201d amendments needs to be part of this debate. This bill is about marriage and only about marriage. Nothing in this bill takes away the existing rights of freedom. It doesn\u2019t create different classes of marriage. What it does is give same-sex marriage the same legal rights as other couples. We have made sure we have removed any element of discrimination in this bill while ensuring that religious freedoms are protected. The LGBTQI couples will be free to marry the person they love in the civil marriage and religious marriage celebrants to only perform religious marriages in accordance to religious beliefs remains unchanged. There may be an amendment is proposed, amendments on free speech, discrimination, education, charity law and tax law. They are all worthy causes and important debates but they don\u2019t need to form part of this bill today. Australia\u2019s sick of excuses and are sick of delays. The majority [voted] yes on same-sex couples being able to marry in this country that they call home in front of friends and family that loved them. They did not vote for a new form of discrimination. Amendments about unrelated issues, amendments which seek to delay same-sex marriage, with a 61.6% of Australians who made their preferences clear ... amendments who seek to unwind or remove any legal rights or discrimination protections will be posed. Australians did not vote for fairness and equality to have their rights peeled away this bill. He finishes and there is applause. But it\u2019s naive to think there is not going to be a very rough amendment debate. Warren Entsch, rainbow tie and all (no one tell Ian Macdonald), has the floor and is talking about the marriage equality legislation. As you are well aware, I have been a longtime advocate to changes in this area and initially found the journey to be very lonely but something that I was absolutely determined to do. In 2004, when the parliament changed the definition of marriage to exclude LGBTIQ Australian, I stood in the party room and questioned the decision. I didn\u2019t understand why we needed to do this. Hadn\u2019t LGBTIQ people been through enough? Why do we need to kick them on the way out the door? To me, it did not make any sense, denying any Australian equal status, and the same of dignity and respect is, in my mind, completely unAustralian. To me, it was really quite simple \u2013 I don\u2019t understand how one section of our community should be treated any different to any other. Life is tough enough and sometimes very hard. And if you are lucky enough to find someone to join you in the good and the bad, well, in my mind, it is fantastic. I strongly believe that couples seeking would like a strengthening the institution of marriage. There have been a lot of commentary about the length of my advocacy and some very flattering remarks in the media. I was labelled as fiercely heterosexual, far north Queensland ... liberal. However, the 12 or 13 years I have been raising this issue to seek the removal of legal and financial discrimination within the gay and the transgender community, and also educating for the right to same-sex and couples to marry, has been relatively short. Compared to those Australians who have had to endure these inequalities of their entire life. Pyne ends the resolution with a celebration over the New England result: We had a byelection in New England, which we have spectacularly won on the weekend, and we have a spectacular win on Saturday, a record-breaking win, the biggest win for a government in a byelection by the way since 1911. Since 1911! The swing was bigger than the Labor vote. As the deputy leader of the House points out, Mr Speaker, we have a byelection in Bennelong as referred to this morning, Mr Speaker. So we have done the right thing on this side the House but I think it is in everyone\u2019s interest to make sure that everyone sitting in the parliament is legitimately sitting here and that is why we move this motion and I look forward to the support of the opposition and the crossbench. I know the government is very excited and all about the New England byelection result but I can\u2019t help but think that if Bennelong doesn\u2019t go its way, or it comes close to not going its way (and honestly, I have no idea how it will all play out on 16 December), the reaction has to go both ways. You can find the whole motion here: Christopher Pyne has the floor in the House of Representatives moving the citizenship resolution. Once those disclosures are in, the parliament will decide how any referrals to the high court will occur \u2013 basically, will the government follow through on its threat to use its numbers (plus one crossbencher) to refer opposition members? The bells are ringing. Hope you\u2019re all ready. Burke also popped up on ABC radio this morning. Responding to questions about Bill Shorten\u2019s meeting with Huang Xiangmo, which came after a 2015 Asio briefing on the potential for Chinese interference with Australian politics, Burke said Labor had responded as the advice had strengthened and stopped taking foreign donations. And this is why as the security advice strengthened Labor took a decision that the government still hasn\u2019t taken that for the people who had concerns raised about them we would stop taking donations from them, even if that put us at a disadvantage. And you\u2019re talking about people who have been significant donors to both sides of politics. You know, for every photo of Bill Shorten there\u2019s a photo of Julie Bishop or some senior member of the government with the people concerned. But Labor, as the advice strengthened, took the decision that we would no longer be taking donations and to this day even for donations to the Bennelong byelection the government won\u2019t rule out whether or not they\u2019re receiving that no matter what advice they get from the security agencies. As for calls to \u201csack\u201d Sam Dastyari, well, my understanding is he could be disendorsed by the party. But it can\u2019t remove him from the Senate. But nothing like a bit of hubris to kick the morning along. Tony Burke has been out and about this morning. Here is a bit of what he had to say about the government\u2019s threat to refer Labor members to the high court, a massive break from convention, which has the potential to have a lot of implications for the future: The government, in cancelling parliament last week, thought they were going to avoid chaos. This government\u2019s able to deliver chaos all on its own. It doesn\u2019t need parliament to help with that. But today, the parliament will have to make a very significant decision because there is a change in the way this place is going to operate. Mr Turnbull has made clear that we will no longer have the practice where referrals are made to the high court on the basis that members of parliament come forward and indicate that they want their cases checked by the high court. He said now it will be made, those decisions would be made by rival political parties and he\u2019s already flagged his intention for the Liberal party to move motions of that nature against Labor and against the Xenophon team. We can\u2019t have a situation, if they\u2019re the new rules, where the new rules apply to the benefit of the Liberal party and no one else. At the moment, the government is going down a path where the parliament will be able to refer members of the Labor party or the crossbench to the high court but will not be able to refer members of the Liberal or National parties any more to the high court if those motions are moved by the Labor party. We need to have a change resolved by the parliament today that, at the end of this week, any member of parliament can move that somebody should be referred to the high court and, if the majority of the parliament votes that way, then the referral will happen. It is born to rule to the extreme. To have a situation where the Liberal party can refer its opponents to the high court but nobody else can do the same back to the Liberal party. It\u2019s not a surprising approaching from Mr Turnbull but it\u2019s completely unacceptable and we\u2019ll be pushing in the parliament today to make sure that we don\u2019t have yet another example of one rule for Mr Turnbull and another rule for everybody else. Someone is having a good morning. Christopher Pyne, who has been subjected to attacks from both Peta Credlin and Andrew Bolt in recent months, seems to be enjoying how they were dragged into the George Christensen non-event. That would be where Bolt admitted he was \u201cauthorised\u201d to send a message to the government that an unnamed MP was going to quit if Malcolm Turnbull wasn\u2019t dumped, only for Christensen to reverse course. Again. Speaking to the ABC this morning, Pyne was positively chipper. \u201cI think it is interesting that George Christensen apparently made those comments to Andrew Bolt and Peta Credlin, who are supposed to be columnists and journalists, and they were engaged in that discussion with him,\u201d he said. Barnaby Joyce will address the Nationals\u2019 party room at 10.30. It is amazing how encouraged a government that claims not to govern by Newspoll is by the New England byelection result. They are taking it as an endorsement of the government. I would have thought it was probably more a reaction to the high court decision more than anything, given that there didn\u2019t seem a lot of people there happy with the ruling, but what would I know? The Brotherhood of St Laurence has released its report into long-term unemployment. From its release: Among 267,000 unemployed people aged 15 to 24 in Australia, almost one in five \u2013 or 50,500 young people \u2013 fall into the \u2018long-term unemployed\u2019 category; that is, they have been out of work for a year or more. Amid recent improvements in overall unemployment, the national anti-poverty group\u2019s analysis of Australia Bureau of Statistics data paints a more uncertain picture for millennial job hunters in the labour market. The Brotherhood\u2019s latest report said the consequence of the 2008 global financial crisis remains defining in the trajectory of Australia\u2019s youth unemployment story. Long-term youth unemployment in Australia is presently three times the number it was before the GFC hit and youth unemployment generally has been hard to shift in the fast-changing modern economy, according to the report, Reality Bites: Australia\u2019s youth employment in a millennial era. Released as part of the Brotherhood of Laurence\u2019s campaign for youth employment, the report points out that the unemployment rate for 15 to 24-year-olds in the labour force sits stubbornly high at 12.4% (trend rate in October 2017) \u2013 more than double the overall unemployment rate of 5.5%. Digging deeper to probe stereotypes of unemployed youth, the report also analysed Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey data and found that unemployed youth undertake as wide a range of job search activities as older jobseekers. \u201cBlaming young unemployed people for their predicament is simply not supported by the facts,\u201d the report said. You can find more information here The Nationals MP Darren Chester says it is disappointing that his Liberal National colleague from Queensland, George Christensen, lied to journalists and others about his plans to quit the Coalition. He said in the \u201cspirit of Christmas\u201d we should forgive George and move on. Christensen admitted on the weekend that he was the anonymous Turnbull government backbencher who had been threatening to quit the government last week but that Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s decision to open a royal commission into the banking industry had changed his mind. Christensen\u2019s decision to stay with the government infuriated News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt, who responded by revealing yesterday that Christensen had encouraged him and Sky News host Peta Credlin to \u201cspread the word\u201d last week that an unnamed Coalition MP was about to quit the government if Turnbull did not step down as leader. Bolt said the tactic was designed to \u201ccreate maximum pressure on Turnbull\u201d but it ended up going nowhere because Christensen wimped out on his threat. Chester told the ABC on Monday that it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that Christensen had \u201cmisled a few people\u201d but he hoped we could move on from it. \u201cHe needs to reflect on that and I\u2019ll have a chat to George privately this week,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s someone that I\u2019ve always regarded as a mate. I think he\u2019s made a blue but he\u2019s owned up to it. In the spirit of Christmas, I think we should forgive him and move on.\u201d When asked about the role that Bolt and Credlin played in the conspiracy, Chester said it raised an important point about \u201cwhat is the role of journalists\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t like the thought that there are active players behind the scenes trying to conspire to bring down a prime minister,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the role of a journalist or columnist.\u201d He did not mention the fact that Credlin is a former chief of staff to Tony Abbott, nor that Bolt is a partisan commentator and entertainer rather than a journalist. Darren Chester was just on Sky saying he did not believe Sam Dastyari would last the week. That is picking up from Malcolm Turnbull who added from his comments last week calling on Dastyari to step down or be sacked from the parliament, with this yesterday: \u201cHe has betrayed Australia\u2019s interests. How Shorten can stick with Dastyari and represent himself as a fit and proper person to be prime minister of Australia is utterly beyond me. Dastyari took thousands of dollars from a Chinese businessman, Mr Huang, to pay off his personal debts. That in itself was incredible, incredibly wrong. He did so and then went to a function for Chinese media and read a script \u2013 we haven\u2019t found out who wrote it \u2013 he read a script in which he abandoned the Labor party\u2019s policy on the South China Sea and essentially delivered the talking points that could have been written by somebody in Beijing. That was also an extraordinary betrayal of Australia\u2019s national interests. Then, we now know he goes to a meeting with Mr Huang and tells him they should leave their phones inside and walk out into the garden so that they can\u2019t be listened into by Australian security agencies. I mean, Dastyari must go. He is not putting Australia first and Shorten is utterly failing as a leader to leave him in the Senate. Just on marriage equality, here is what the prime minister had to say about those \u201creligious freedom\u201d amendments George Brandis moved in the Senate (and was defeated on), on Sky News on Sunday: There are others that I may not be aware of but, broadly speaking, I support the amendments that George Brandis moved in the Senate that weren\u2019t adopted. In particular, I don\u2019t believe that a celebrant, a marriage celebrant, should be obliged to celebrate any wedding they don\u2019t want to. You know, we could make this very simple, just simply say that if you\u2019re authorised to celebrate a marriage, you\u2019re not obliged to celebrate any particular marriage that you choose not to. You know, there a plenty of marriage celebrants. No one is every going to have difficulty finding someone to celebrate their marriage, so you just deal with that in a very practical way. The other point that George raised \u2013 there are other amendments of similar intent \u2013 is to make it clear that there is nothing in the bill that prevents or inhibits or hinders anyone from expressing their views about what is the right, you know \u2018morally right\u2019 form of marriage. I mean there are plenty of things that are legal but that people reasonably feel are morally wrong. Adultery is wrong but it\u2019s not illegal. Marrying somebody who has been divorced before, who has been married before, is perfectly legal but many churches teach that that is not in accordance with their teachings. So people are entitled to express their own heartfelt views on these issues and that shouldn\u2019t be inhibited. You know, frankly, the bill doesn\u2019t do that, it doesn\u2019t inhibit it. So what what George has proposed, what George proposed to the Senate, was really belt and braces to confirm that which was already plain. I have legitimately never heard of this word before. Never. Newspoll #24 has Labor leading the Coalition 53 to 47 points on the two-party preferred measure. That\u2019s a slight bump from the 55 to 45 poll in the last Newspoll. It really speaks volumes that being behind, but not being as behind, is seen as a win by this government. Any Coalition MPs who haven\u2019t checked their emails as yet, a secret squirrel has passed this along to us from Nola Marino: Members, including ministers, should attend the members\u2019 annex at 9.30 today for a briefing with the prime minister, leader of the House and chief whip about proceedings in the House this week. Thank you for your cooperation. The House sits at 10, with the citizenship resolution up first. For those wanting to follow along with the disclosures once they are published, you will find them here. They should be up from midday. The House disclosures are due by 8pm on Tuesday. The Senate is also sitting at 10, where the Fair Work bill is up first. Penalty rates will be part of this. The House will probably get around to voting on marriage equality midweek. Looks like we are not the only one preparing for a rough day. George Christensen is indulging in the age-old tradition of Vague Booking to make his feelings know this morning. I hope everyone has had their breakfast and is gripping an extra large coffee, because you are going to need it today. Barnaby Joyce romped it in at the New England election (no surprises there) and the government is hoping that is the start of a much-needed reset. The Turnbull government has lost its 24th Newspoll in a row (Malcolm Turnbull rolled Tony Abbott after 30). But the government is hopeful that the return of Joyce will bring the Nationals back in line. Joyce will attend party room today, which might be a slightly uncomfortable time for George Christensen who outed himself as the unnamed MP who \u201cauthorised\u201d Andrew Bolt and Peta Credlin to make known he was planning on quitting the government if Turnbull remained PM. Christensen, who denied to multiple journalists he was the MP in question, said he changed his mind about quitting after the government capitulated and decided to hold a royal commission into the banks. This is about the third or fourth time Christensen has made this threat and not followed through. Doubt he is in for a good day. Then again, the New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, is standing by his Friday call that Turnbull should stand down and give the nation a Christmas present. Oh to be a fly on the party room meeting wall. Also unlikely to have a good day is Sam Dastyari, as the government continues to seek the Labor senator\u2019s resignation following revelations he met with a Chinese donor and warned him he was probably under surveillance by intelligence agencies. Bill Shorten demoted him last week but said he hadn\u2019t broken any laws. On the weekend Turnbull said one shouldn\u2019t assume Dastyari wasn\u2019t under investigation. But either way the government is now seeking to tighten up some laws and will act on banning foreign donations. Shorten himself is in the news, with Fairfax Media reporting he met with the Chinese donor in question, Huang Xiangmo, to secure donations ahead of the 2016 federal election, despite Asio warning the major parties about possible Chinese influence in Australian politics in 2015. Both major parties have dealings with Huang, with the Daily Telegraph reporting over the weekend one of Huang\u2019s former advisers has joined John Alexander\u2019s Bennelong byelection campaign. Stay tuned. And all of that before we even get to the citizenship declarations, which are due this week. Christopher Pyne has warned the government will go against convention and refer Labor members with questions over the timing of their renouncements to the high court. Turnbull swears there are no other Coalition members with questions, something he said before Stephen Parry resigned over dual citizenship and then John Alexander resigned over dual citizenship. So it should be a fun week. Then there is marriage equality, which hits the House this week, with a question over whether it will get through without \u201creligious freedoms\u201d amendments. Penalty rates are also on the agenda. Who knows what else this week will throw up? Certainly not a festive spirit. As always, Mike Bowers, fresh from Tamworth, is prowling the halls and chambers. Follow along with him here and here. You can reach me in the comments, or on twitter at @amyremeikis with updates here (including on the Queensland election, just head to the story) as well. I am on coffee number three, so it\u2019s going to be a great day! Ready? Let\u2019s get started."
"24||Can you solve it? This traffic teaser will drive you to distractionHi guzzlers, Key to ignition. Brain in gear. Now drive: Five cars are driving round a roundabout. In order, the drivers are Akira, Basho, Chie, Daichi and Etsu. The cars have licence plates numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, but not necessarily in that order. Each driver can see only the licence plate of the car in front of them and the car behind them, but not of the car they are driving. All the drivers can speak to and hear each other via headphones. A voice comes into their headphones and asks: \u201cIs your licence plate a square number?\u201d They all reply in unison: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d The voice repeats: \u201cIs your licence plate a square number?\u201d They reply in unison \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d except Etsu, who pipes up saying: \u201cErm, no\u201d. The voice asks: \u201cIs your licence plate number bigger than the number of the plate behind you?\u201d Daichi is getting annoyed now: \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d. After which Basho and Etsu state: \u201cNo\u201d And Akira and Chie grin: \u201cYes\u201d Who is in which car?

If you like paper-and-pencil puzzles, no one makes puzzles as beautiful and interesting as the Japanese do. In the Spring I flew to Tokyo to interview their best-known puzzle inventors and find their most entertaining and interesting creations. The result is my new book Puzzle Ninja, which includes more than 200 original, handmade Japanese puzzles, as well as background material about Japanese puzzle culture. If you are looking for an entertaining, beautifully-designed book for Christmas, it also comes in a lovely, soft Japanese-style jacket. I very much recommend it!

"8||Theresa May fails to strike Brexit border deal with Irish governmentTheresa May and the Irish government have failed to reach a deal on the crucial Brexit issue of the Northern Ireland border ahead of a crunch meeting on Monday lunchtime with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Despite intense efforts over the weekend to agree a proposal on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Irish officials revealed at midnight on Sunday that \u201cthere is still a way to go\u201d to achieve a meeting of minds on the issue. \u201cThe Irish government remains hopeful \u2013 but at this stage it is very difficult to make a prediction,\u201d said an official. The failure to seal a deal threatens to delay the progression of the Brexit negotiations to the second phase covering trade and the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. May will meet Juncker with the UK\u2019s final offer on the three main issues in the first round of Brexit talks \u2013 the Irish border, citizens\u2019 rights and the financial settlement. Talks could continue into Wednesday when the European commissioners are due to meet to discuss their recommendation to European leaders on whether \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been achieved to move talks on to trade and transition arrangements. May had been given the deadline of Monday 4 December to table the offers before a European council summit on 14 December, when EU leaders will decide if \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made to proceed to the next phase. But although the money and citizens\u2019 rights issues have been mostly resolved, the future arrangement with Ireland has remained a significant obstacle because the British government has yet to offer a firm commitment explaining how it will guarantee avoiding a return to a hard border after Brexit. For Ireland, and the EU27 as a whole, the problem has become a potential dealbreaker, with Dublin given an effective veto on progress of talks. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Simon Coveney had said on Sunday morning that Ireland had \u201cno desire\u201d to be a roadblock to progress but said the country wants \u201cconcrete\u201d proposals on how a hard border with customs and people checks would be avoided. Coveney told the broadcaster RTE that Monday was \u201cundoubtedly a very big day in the context of Brexit negotiations\u201d and that \u201ccertainly the hope is that those meetings will result in a momentum that can be carried into the leaders\u2019 summit\u201d. Chances of a deal with British officials had been put at 50:50 on Sunday afternoon, but at midnight Brussels time, officials said an agreement had not been reached. \u201cContacts continue at official level in order to reach agreement. There is still a way to go,\u201d said an Irish official. \u201cThere must be clarity on the need to avoid regulatory divergence which would lead to the re-emergence of a border. \u201cA positive outcome to the talks between UK PM May and President Tusk and President Juncker will be very important if we are to make the progress necessary before the European Council,\u201d the Irish official added. A special meeting of the Irish cabinet has been called for Monday morning in which ministers will get an update. In London, a government spokesman said: \u201cWith plenty of discussions still to go, Monday will be an important staging post on the road to the crucial December council.\u201d Two hours before Monday\u2019s lunch with May, Juncker is to join the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, along with members of the chamber\u2019s Brexit steering committee, to discuss outstanding issues on the future rights of EU citizens after the UK leaves the bloc. Although this issue is largely resolved, Juncker requested the meeting to refresh himself on the problems MEPs continue to have with the progress on citizens\u2019 rights, including British resistance to cementing a role for the European court of justice (ECJ) in protecting the status of EU nationals living in Britain. Beyond the issue of the ECJ, the parliament also wants the UK to drop any charges for EU nationals when they apply for settled status post-Brexit. They are also insistent that future family members of those living in the UK today should be covered by whatever benefits are dispensed by the withdrawal agreement. The parliament must ratify any treaty on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU before Brexit in March 2019. May is coming under strong pressure from Tory Brexiters unhappy with some of the compromises that she has already made in the process. Many of her MPs would want to see her abandon Brexit negotiations altogether if the EU summit in December rules against opening trade talks. On Sunday, senior Conservative Brexiters set new red lines for May in the talks with the EU, significantly reducing her chances of getting a deal acceptable to the whole of her party. The former cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith, Owen Paterson, Nigel Lawson and John Redwood said it would be unacceptable for the ECJ to have any jurisdiction over the UK during the planned two-year transition after Brexit. Duncan Smith set out his objections in an article in the Sunday Telegraph in which he said he particularly opposed a plan for the ECJ to have an ongoing role, beyond the transition, adjudicating on the rights of EU nationals in the UK. Paterson, Lawson and Redwood, along with more than 30 other Brexiters, have signed a letter coordinated by the group Leave Means Leave listing seven conditions they say should apply before the UK makes any divorce payment to the EU. But on Sunday, in a message to Tory Brexiters, the health secretary Jeremy Hunt suggested that if May were brought down, Brexit might not happen. He said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t back Theresa May, we will have no Brexit.\u201d Speaking to BBC1\u2019s Breakfast programme on Monday Paterson, the former environment secretary, insisted the group was \u201cright behind the prime minister\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s made a very generous offer in Florence, which the European Union were pretty churlish about,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we are doing is restating what we had in the Conservative party manifesto, which was a promise to deliver what the 17.4m people voted for, which was to leave the single market, leave the customs union, and very importantly, leave the ECJ.\u201d Asked why the ECJ element had to be completed in March 2019, Paterson said it was vital to avoid \u201csome muddled transition for which we\u2019re half in and half out\u201d so the UK could begin forging a post-Brexit future. Asked about the Irish border issue Paterson, who also spent two years as Northern Ireland secretary, said: \u201cI\u2019m very dismayed by the importance being given to this. I really think this is soluble.\u201d"
"20||The millennials donating 10% of their pay to save the worldWITH a six-figure salary from a London private equity firm, it could be expected that Grayden Reece-Smith would be living it up on eye-wateringly expensive holidays or driving a suitably flash sports car around south London, where he lives. Instead, the 28-year-old lives a very different existence to his peers and gives away everything he earns over \u00a342,000 \u2013 a figure he calculated he could comfortably live on. Over the past five years, Reece-Smith has handed over more than \u00a3250,000 to organisations such as International Care Ministries, which helps poverty stricken families in the Philippines, and the Against Malaria Foundation. He is part of a growing number of young professionals described as \u201ceffective altruists\u201d who claim to use evidence and analysis to accomplish good. Influenced by his protestant faith, Reece-Smith was tempted to work in the charity sector after graduating but calculated he could make a bigger difference by donating a significant chunk of his salary. He had volunteered as a teacher at a school in Tanzania but believed that earning and giving would be more effective. \u201cI realised that the cost of my flights there could have paid the salaries of two teachers for an entire year.\u201d Instead, he says, he could \u201cstay at home, living a very nice life and still make a huge difference in the world\u201d. \u201c\u00a342,000 is more than enough to live on and still save,\u201d he says. \u201cI still fill my Isa every year.\u201d He is not frugal \u2013 last year he holidayed in Cuba and spent a few grand on a new sofa \u2013 but his lifestyle certainly isn\u2019t as luxurious as his colleagues. \u201cI tend to buy branded food products, and I don\u2019t own a car. Other people [on my salary] might have a bigger house. We only bought what we needed \u2013 a two bedroom flat; some of my colleagues have four-bedroom houses.\u201d Effective altruists typically donate regularly to a charity they think will have the most impact rather than a cause that pulls at their heart-strings. Some switch careers to generate more money which can then be given away. Advocates tend to believe people should explore giving money abroad. The Australian moral philosopher and author Peter Singer, who supports the movement, once pointed out that it costs thousands of pounds to train a guide dog and its user, while less than \u00a350 in the developing world could cure a blind person with trachoma, an infectious eye disease. \u201cYou could provide one guide dog for one blind American or you could cure between 400 and 2,000 people of blindness,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear what\u2019s the better thing to do.\u201d The Centre of Effective Altruism, based in Oxford, estimates there are between 500 and 1,000 people who identify with the practice in the UK and it is also becoming popular in California. Singer says many millennials have become interested and want their donations of time and money to have the most impact possible. After leaving Oxford University in 1971, Singer started to donate 10% of his income. As his earnings increased, so did his level of donations, and today he and his wife, a writer, give away 40%. He recommends 10% as an amount many people could afford. \u201cI think it\u2019s an amount that most middle-class people can comfortably afford,\u201d he says. \u201cIt depends on how much people are earning and how happy they are to live modestly.\u201d Singer says he leads a happy yet modest life. \u201cI probably holiday less, and in terms of house purchases we live in a one-bedroom apartment [in New York]. We would have perhaps bought a larger apartment if I hadn\u2019t been giving it away but it\u2019s a nice apartment in a good area.\u201d Emily Dally, 27, earns \u00a348,000 a year as a lawyer for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and has given away 10% of her salary since she signed the Giving What We Can Pledge three years ago. \u201cI\u2019d just finished law school and was taking a job in the city and feeling a bit funny about it. I was morally conflicted about whether it was the right thing to do, and I saw this as a good way of carrying on [with her career],\u201d she says. Over the past three years, she has donated about \u00a320,000 to the Against Malaria Foundation. The amount she gives away has not hugely impacted her quality of her life \u2013 she and her boyfriend, Sam, who also gives away 10% of his income, were still able to put a deposit down on a flat in Hackney, east London, last year. \u201cI might have spent more on holidays or gifts for people, and I suppose I\u2019d be saving more,\u201d she says. \u201cI might question whether I should get that last drink or go to that fancy restaurant, but I still have plenty of money. \u201cMy parents were shocked. Their initial response was, \u2018God, that\u2019s a lot. I hope you can still manage.\u2019 They were worried that when Sam and I ever start a family that it might be problematic.\u201d As a result of the donations from effective altruists, organisations ranked by charity evaluator GiveWell are reporting a jump in donations. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a very significant increase in donations that we can directly attribute to the growth of the effective altruist community,\u201d says Rob Mather of the Against Malaria Foundation, which saw donations rise 280% to \u00a33.27m in 2012 when it was ranked the number one most effective charity by GiveWell. Some of the ideas of the effective altruism movement have drawn criticism. Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago, is sceptical that its focus on giving to developing nations can ever have broad appeal. \u201cFor most people, charitable giving is, and will remain, a more emotional and instinctive activity, often grounded in religious commitments, local connections, or personal experiences,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might make more sense\u2026 to give money closer to home where you can observe how it is used, and may feel stronger emotional rewards than are offered by the rather abstract process of sending money off to a foreign country and never seeing the results.\u201d Posner is also vocal about a view raised in the effective altruism movement that it can be more effective to choose a career in a higher-paid job in order to donate more to charity. \u201cMany of the highest-paying jobs \u2013 say, in finance \u2013 will seem reprehensible to the sort of person who is altruistically inclined. I think most people won\u2019t be able to sustain a double life in which they do things they are ashamed of even if it does much good for others.\u201d Singer is slightly optimistic about the growth of the movement, pointing to a wave of effective altruism groups spreading across university campuses. \u201cSome people suggest there might be a limit, as not everyone will be interested in living more altruistically or thinking about effectiveness, but even if we got 10% of affluent people involved, it could make a big difference.\u201d By the book Kat Steiner, 27, lives in Oxford and is an assistant librarian at the Bodleian Education Library. She earns \u00a325,000 per year and receives around \u00a310,000 a year from investments (made by her parents on her behalf). It was while studying at Oxford that Steiner was introduced to the ideas of thinking critically about giving to charity and potentially donating a significant portion of your income. \u201cStudying philosophy meant that we often talked about things in terms of abstract ideas, but this was a more practical discussion of whether it was the right thing to do and the possible consequences,\u201d she says. At first, Steiner resisted signing up to Giving What We Can, a body in which members pledge to give at least 10% of their earnings to charity until they retire. \u201cI was concerned about making such a big decision before I\u2019d even had a full-time job.\u201d However, with many of her friends taking the pledge and Steiner road testing the idea by donating 10% of her income as a trial run for a year, she decided to sign the pledge in 2014. While the librarian says she doesn\u2019t have very \u201cexpensive taste or hobbies\u201d, she\u2019s aware that the decision may result in less financial security. \u201cI was concerned that if something very expensive happened, I wouldn\u2019t be able to cope. But I\u2019m pretty happy that I\u2019m saving enough, and my family is financially secure as a whole.\u201d"
"20||Our Virgin train was delayed \u2026 and so was our \u2018automatic\u2019 refundI am very frustrated with Virgin Trains West Coast. I bought advance tickets from its website \u2013 two reduced tickets for a senior costing \u00a314.50 each and one for \u00a322, for a total of \u00a351 \u2013 largely because it is offering automatic refunds if a train is delayed. Sure enough, our train from Crewe to Euston on 5 November was well over 90 minutes late arriving into London. Virgin boasts that it will send an email confirming the refund within 24 hours, with it landing in your account within three days. Neither happened. As a precaution I completed an online form having heard nothing after three days. Follow-up emails to customer service have resulted in no progress whatsoever. It is beyond my understanding that in these days of sophisticated technology that someone keying in the fact that the train was late does not result in a virtually instantaneous refund! DF, Crewe You eventually did receive your refund, trumpeted by Virgin as a \u201cno forms, no fuss\u201d deal. To add insult to injury you were invited to complete Virgin\u2019s customer satisfaction survey \u2013 which you have declined to do.

"20||We have a new mortgage and would like to travel for a year. Can we do it?Q I would be very grateful for any advice you can offer regarding having a mortgage but wanting to go travelling for a year. My partner and I got a mortgage to buy our flat last year. We are currently both in full-time jobs but are thinking it would be nice to take a year out and go travelling. We (naively) thought that we could just rent out our flat (I know easier said than done) and set off on our travels. But now I have been reading that we may have to change our mortgage to a buy-to-let mortgage, which could significantly increase our interest rate and may result in charges due to changes in a three-year fixed-term contract. So my question is, do we have to change our mortgage, or is there a way we can keep it the same, given that it is short term and we won\u2019t actually be making a profit on the income of the rent (just helping to pay off the mortgage whilst we are away). KG A You are right that you can\u2019t just rent out your flat and set off on your travels but you may not need to worry about converting your mortgage to a buy-to-let loan. If you don\u2019t plan to let your flat for more than 12 months and you intend to return to living in it, most lenders will consider what\u2019s called a \u201dconsent to let\u201d arrangement for which there may be a administration fee of \u00a3100 to \u00a3300. As well as charging a fee to give you permission to let your property, some lenders will also increase the mortgage interest rate although they may not do this if you are on a fixed-rate deal. Before giving its consent to let, a lender will need to be satisfied that your plan to let your flat has come about through a genuine change in your personal circumstances \u2013 for example, you have to move for work reasons and possibly, you\u2019ve decided to go off travelling. You are unlikely to get consent to let if it looks as though you were always planning to let your property but applied for a residential mortgage to get a better deal. But before approaching your lender to see if it will give you permission to let your property or if it will insist you swap to a buy-to-let mortgage (which it may), you need to find out if letting your flat is a realistic proposition. You need to know first whether the flat is in a fit state to be let and if it is how much rent you could get for it. If it isn\u2019t in a fit state to let, you need to know what you should do to make it suitable, which could include fitting smoke alarms and extractor fans and making sure that any upholstered furniture is fire proof. You\u2019ll also need to have gas appliances tested by a Gas Safe engineer and provide your tenants with an energy performance certificate. If you plan to use a lettings agent to manage the letting of your flat \u2013 and deal with tenants while you are away - you should factor in their charge for this service which is generally 10% to 15% of the rental income. On top of that, you\u2019ll need to pay for landlord insurance to protect the property while it has tenants in it, which your current buildings and contents insurance won\u2019t. You should also factor in the cost of storing items that you don\u2019t want left in the flat while you are out of the country. With any luck, the net rental income after deducting all the extra costs of being an absentee landlord will cover the mortgage. If it doesn\u2019t, your travel plans will have to wait."
"22||Is owning a dog good for your health?Dogs really are our best friends, according to a Swedish study that says canine ownership could reduce heart disease. A study of 3.4 million people between the ages of 40 and 80 found that having a dog was associated with a 23% reduction in death from heart disease and a 20% lower risk of dying from any cause over the 12 years of the study. Previous studies have suggested dogs relieve social isolation and depression \u2013 both linked to an increased risk of heart disease and early death. The solution Dog owners show better responses to stress (their blood pressure and pulse rates don\u2019t soar), have higher levels of physical activity and slightly lower cholesterol levels. The American Heart Association was sufficiently swayed by a review of dozens of studies to release a statement in 2013 saying that owning a dog \u201cwas probably\u201d associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Their reluctance to more strongly endorse dog ownership is because most studies are what is called observational \u2013 researchers note an association, but can\u2019t prove causation. This means that other factors might explain why dog owners are healthier than, say, goldfish owners \u2013 for example, perhaps only people who are fit in the first place buy pets that need daily walkies. Tove Fall, an epidemiologist and the lead author of this latest study, says they tried their best to allow for any differences in education, existing ill-health and lifestyles between those with and without dogs. The study found the biggest positive impact of having a dog was on people living alone. \u201cIt seems that a dog can be a substitute for living with other people in terms of reducing the risk of dying,\u201d says Fall. \u201cDogs encourage you to walk, they provide social support and they make life more meaningful. If you have a dog, you interact more with other people. If you do get ill and go into hospital and you have a dog, there\u2019s a huge motivation to try to get back home.\u201d Of course, getting a dog and watching it from your sofa while you eat fatty food is not going to reduce your risk of heart disease. And a toy dog may look cute, but won\u2019t have any effect either. Fall\u2019s study showed the most health benefits came from having retrievers or pointers. Until her German shorthaired pointer died last year, she ran 10km with her most days. \u201cIn Sweden, we have one of the lowest rates of dog ownership in Europe,\u201d says Fall, who has recently got a new puppy. \u201cMaybe this will increase the acceptance that dogs are important to people.\u201d"
"26||Google Pixel Buds review: Bluetooth earbuds are a missed opportunityThe Google Pixel Buds are a set of wireless neckband-style Bluetooth earbuds that have a few fancy tricks up their sleeve, including the ability to near real-time translation. But are they really that good? First things first, the Google Pixel Buds are not entirely wireless, unlike Bluetooth earbuds such as the Bragi Dash Pro or Apple\u2019s AirPods. Instead there\u2019s a cable running between the two earbuds, which is a shame, as cables between earbuds are no longer needed, and it frequently gets tugged and caught by clothing, restricting the movement of your head. Fit The cable pokes through a little hole in the earbuds to form a size-adjustable loop that sticks into your ear to help keep them from falling out, similar to the \u201cwings\u201d used by competitors. Unfortunately the loop changes size when the cable gets tugged. The Pixel Buds have no sound isolation, but instead just sit in your ear and direct the sound into your ear canal with a similar earbud shape to Apple\u2019s EarPods. While in-ear comfort depends on the shape of your ears, I found the Pixel Buds to be uncomfortable to wear for any period longer than about 30 minutes, causing ear ache. That\u2019s not the case for most canal-bud style wireless earbuds. They are less comfortable than the AirPods. Sound The Pixel Buds actually sound good for earbuds that have no isolation. They don\u2019t have thunderous bass, nor particularly sparkling highs, but they have a relatively well-rounded sound and can be cranked up to uncomfortable listening volumes. A swipe left or right on the right earbud adjusts the volume. I found the differences between each step of the volume too large, ending up either too quiet or too loud to comfortably listen. I resorted to setting volume with my phone, but as soon as you swiped on the earbuds it went back to either being too quiet or too loud. The rest of the controls work well. Tap once on the right earbud to pause or play music (you can\u2019t skip tracks through), tap twice to read out the time and your latest notifications, or tap and hold to talk to Google Assistant. Google Assistant The latter is the Pixel Buds\u2019 ace in the hole. Talking to Google Assistant is so fast. Put your finger on the earbud and speak, and release it to have Assistant answer. Nothing else is that fast, not even the AirPods with Siri on an iPhone. Of course, it only works when you have an internet connection, but it\u2019s pretty handy. Assistant alerts you each time a notification arrives and can read them out on demand, just tap on the right earbud when the chime sounds, or double tap at any other time. When it works, it does so surprisingly well, but I found that sometimes the system would stop working, failing to notice that there were notifications waiting for me despite the phone vibrating in my pocket. You can also reply via voice transcription if you have an internet connection, or if you ignore enough of the notification chimes Assistant will silence notifications for the next 30 minutes. Some will love the notifications, but others will find them incredibly annoying, disrupting whatever they\u2019re listening to. Translation The Pixel Buds\u2019 party trick is tight integration with Google Translate, but it only works if you have one of Google\u2019s Pixel line of smartphones. Activate Assistant and say \u201chelp me speak French\u201d and it\u2019ll fire up Translate on the phone. It then uses the app\u2019s real-time translation system, piping part of the audio through the earbuds. You tap and hold to speak, then release to hear the translation played to whomever you\u2019re trying to converse with through your phone. Pressing a button on the phone and talking into it will lead to a translation being played into your ear when the button is released. The Translate app does the same thing, with two buttons on screen without needing the Pixel Buds, which in some ways is more straightforward. It\u2019s a gimmick I\u2019m not sure I would use, preferring to just use the phone alone as it\u2019s easier to explain to someone who doesn\u2019t speak your language how it works when you can both hear the results, and it\u2019s pretty rude to speak to someone with earbuds in. Case The Pixel Buds come with a little fabric case to store and charge them. They magnetically clip into little docking holes to charge, with the cable looping around a ring inside the case. There\u2019s a small button on the inside of the case that contains some LEDs that tell you how charged both the case or the earbuds. It works OK, but doesn\u2019t feel like the most robust of cases. I fear for its longevity. Pairing them was meant to be as simple as opening the case near a Pixel 2 smartphone and tapping on a notification. It didn\u2019t work. No matter what I did the notification didn\u2019t appear. In the end I resorted to manually triggering pairing by pressing and holding the button. Then everything worked as described by simply tapping on the notification on my phone. You have to perform a similar procedure to connect the Pixel Buds to other devices such as iPhones or Windows 10 PCs. Battery life Google reckons you\u2019ll get five hours\u2019 constant listening out of the earbuds, while the case holds 24 hours\u2019 battery life. This seemed about right, although I couldn\u2019t test the five-hour claim as they hurt my ears too much to continue listening for five hours straight, but I didn\u2019t have to charge them over a week and a bit of listening to them for a total of about two hours a day in stints. Connectivity was rock solid, and call quality was pretty good too, with both sides of the conversation clearly audible unless it was windy, when I couldn\u2019t hear a thing thanks to the lack of isolation. Observations It\u2019s very difficult to put them in your ears without triggering a control such as starting music playback If wound tight, the cable doesn\u2019t quite fit in the case, requiring an extra fold They can only connect to one Bluetooth device at any one time Price The Google Pixel Buds cost \u00a3159 (buy here). For comparison, Apple\u2019s AirPods cost \u00a3159 (buy here), the Bragi Headphone cost \u20ac169/\u00a3149 (buy here) and the Bragi Dash Pro cost \u20ac349/\u00a3308 (buy here). Verdict The Google Pixel Buds are an interesting but flawed set of wireless earbuds. The smart features, battery life and sound are good, but the volume control is poor and we\u2019ve moved past the need for a cable to connect wireless earbuds. Some might like the lack of sound isolation - I do not and I didn\u2019t find them comfortable for any extended period. The case is cute, but has a flimsy hinge and cloth covering, which do not instill confidence that they\u2019re built to last. In many ways the Pixel Buds are a missed opportunity. Maybe next year. Pros: rapid Google Assistant, Translate, good battery life, good sound Cons: no isolation, a cable, questions over durability of case, not all features work with all devices, no multi-device connection Other reviews I tried every set of wireless earbuds until I found some that worked, so you don\u2019t have to AirPods review: the best non-isolating wireless earbuds, but only for Apple"
"36||Clocking off: the companies introducing nap time to the workplaceOne of the more annoying habits of highly successful people is their tendency to advertise how little sleep they need. Former Yahoo boss Marissa Mayer can operate on four hours, Apple CEO Tim Cook is at the gym by 5am and designer and film director Tom Ford gets three hours a night, and keeps Post-it notes by his bed in case he wakes up with an idea. Stealing an extra 20 minutes in bed in the morning is practically taboo in the world of high-stakes business, where snoozing has long been equated with losing. Arianna Huffington has been on a mission to destigmatise sleep after collapsing from exhaustion 10 years ago. Describing the incident as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d, the Huffington Post founder wrote a book called The Sleep Revolution and launched Thrive Global, which provides workplace wellness training for corporations. \u201cThat idea that sleep is somehow a sign of weakness and that burnout and sleep deprivation are macho signs of strength is particularly destructive,\u201d Huffington says. \u201cSo changing the way we talk about sleep is an important part of the culture shift.\u201d But it\u2019s not just those at the top of the corporate ladder who feel under pressure to power through. Most of us are getting less sleep. While sufficient sleep is generally defined as between seven and nine hours, a National Sleep Foundation survey [pdf] found the average adult in the UK is getting just six hours and 49 minutes, in the US that\u2019s six hours and 31 minutes, and Japan is worse again at six hours and 22 minutes. \u201cThere\u2019s a Gallup poll from 1942 that demonstrated that the average adult was sleeping 7.9 hours, so I think there\u2019s been a remarkable lopping off of sleep time,\u201d says Matthew Walker, neuroscientist and author of Why We Sleep: The New Science of Sleep and Dreams. Walker says we are in the midst of a \u201cglobal sleep-loss epidemic\u201d and that demanding work schedules and commutes are among the contributing factors. \u201cLonger commute times and longer hours are squeezing sleep almost like vice grips,\u201d he adds. Sleep loss can seriously damage your health. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really any aspect of your health, mind or wellness that isn\u2019t dependent on sufficient sleep,\u201d Walker says. But it\u2019s the impact it has on productivity that is starting to make some companies revise attitudes to sleep and rest. Lack of sleep costs most developed nations 2% of their GDP, which for the UK equates to \u00a340bn. Employers are starting to recognise the importance of sleep. Google has installed sleep pods in its offices for staff requiring a nap. The high-tech beds, which look like the hibernation chambers in Alien crossed with Pac-Man, include a built-in sound system for those who like to drift off to relaxing music. An afternoon nap can help improve performance without interfering with night-time sleep, according to Rita Aouad, psychiatrist and sleep specialist at Ohio State University. \u201cLots of research shows that a nap of about 20 minutes in the afternoon has a positive effect on attention vigilance mood and alertness,\u201d she says. Nike\u2019s headquarters in Portland, Oregon has rooms where employees can sleep or meditate. The company is among those offering flexible work times to employees to suit their chronotype \u2013 the internal clock that programmes your ideal sleep time and dictates whether you are a morning person or a night owl. \u201cMorning types are celebrated and deemed more worthy because they are in the office earlier,\u201d says Walker. \u201cEvening types are usually penalised because they come in late, but they could work late. Companies are starting to understand that it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault \u2013 it\u2019s genetic.\u201d Procter &amp; Gamble has lighting systems in its offices that regulate melatonin, the sleep hormone, to help employees switch off in the evenings. Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s was an early adopter of this understanding approach to the need for rest and relaxation, and has had a nap room at its headquarters for over a decade. The company\u2019s HR director Jane Goetschius says that along with other perks, such as yoga classes and an on-site gym, the nap room is part of a wider strategy to show employees they\u2019re appreciated. \u201cWe want you to bring your whole self [to work]. It builds more productivity,\u201d she says. It\u2019s not just the big corporations that are investing in a well-rested workforce. Shai Aharony, founder of London-based online marketing agency Reboot, encourages staff to take a nap in a dedicated quiet room in the office if they\u2019re feeling drowsy, and tries to prevent work emails after hours. \u201cWe send an automated response to clients who email after work hours saying the email won\u2019t be dealt with unless it is urgent and re-sent marked urgent,\u201d he says. \u201cThe vast majority of the time the client will just leave it because it makes them think. It has made a huge difference.\u201d But will efforts like these have much of an impact? \u201cI\u2019m broadly in favour of nap pods, even if they just signal some degree of recognition of sleep\u2019s importance in the workplace by people in senior positions,\u201d says Walker. Organisational, societal and structural change is what\u2019s required, he says, adding that moves like the French government\u2019s decision to impose a law that gives workers the right to disconnect from emails out of hours should be encouraged. \u201cSleep has an image problem. In this modern day and age we have not only abandoned a full night\u2019s sleep, we don\u2019t celebrate it anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to return to this mentality that sleep is OK.\u201d"
"21||Aacta awards 2017: Lion and Ali's Wedding sweep early categoriesThe internationally acclaimed film Lion has swept the early prizes of Australia\u2019s biggest film and TV awards, winning seven of eight feature film categories at the industry luncheon on Monday, before the main award announcements on Wednesday. The spectre of sexual harassment allegations in the industry loomed over the luncheon, which was held two days after Geoffrey Rush stepped down as president of the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts. Last week, the Sydney Theatre Company revealed to the Daily Telegraph that Rush had been subject to a complaint of \u201cinappropriate behaviour\u201d during a production of King Lear two years ago, an allegation the actor denies. \u201cIn the current climate of innuendo and unjustifiable reporting, I believe the decision to make a clean break to clear the air is the best for all concerned,\u201d Rush said when announcing his decision to step down. While no mention of Rush was made on stage at Monday\u2019s event, and the actor didn\u2019t attend, the Aacta CEO, Damian Trewhella, used his opening remarks to draw attention to an upcoming Safer Workplace Strategies event in Sydney organised by Women in Film and Television (Wift). \u201cHealth and safety are paramount in a modern Australian screen industry,\u201d Trewhella said, encouraging industry professionals to attend the event. Lion, a co-production between the Weinstein Company and Screen Australia, stars Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman, and tells the true story of a man who used Google Earth to track down his childhood home. It was nominated for six Academy Awards and won two Baftas earlier this year, and on Monday won every category in which it was nominated: for best adapted screenplay, best editing, best cinematography, best sound, best costume design, best original music score and best production design. Lion\u2019s producer, Emile Sherman, told Fairfax in October that it was \u201cincredibly distressing\u201d to learn about the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, whose production company co-produced Lion. \u201cHopefully, this is a turning point not only in our industry but also for men in power in general,\u201d he said. The only remaining category for a feature film, best original screenplay, was won by Osamah Sami and Andrew Knight for Ali\u2019s Wedding. \u201cIt means nothing and it means everything,\u201d Sami said after winning the award, paying tribute to his father who died after a trip abroad with Sami four years ago. \u201cThat trip was me winning everything, so nothing will ever come anywhere close. I would swap 10 of these [awards] to spend an hour with him.\u201d Sami is also nominated for the best lead actor award, which will be announced at the main event on Wednesday night. Monday\u2019s luncheon also covered awards in the television industry, which were led by Seven Types of Ambiguity, the six-part drama based on the novel by Elliot Perlman. That series won three of the five awards it was nominated for: best direction in a television drama or comedy, best cinematography in television, and best editing. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honour for this particular show,\u201d said producer Tony Ayres after accepting the award in lieu of director Glendyn Ivin. \u201cWe sweated blood for it. It took a long time in development, it took a long time to get it right.\u201d Bonnie Elliot was named best cinematographer for the series, only the second woman working in TV to win that award, the last being Mandy Walker in 1996 for Parklands. \u201cIt\u2019s been a slow process for us getting here,\u201d said Elliot, who also said she explicitly aims for gender parity among her camera crew. \u201cAs Mandy Walker inspired me I hope to inspire other women to get behind the lens.\u201d She was not the only female cinematographer awarded on Monday: Jody Muston took the best cinematography gong for documentary, for Blue, with Jon Shaw. No women have ever won the award for best cinematography in film. Another television adaptation, Wake in Fright, took out the awards for best sound and best original score for what composers Antony Partos and Matteo Zingales called a \u201cvisceral, psychological score; it combined a lot of recorded elements and was quite experimental in some degree\u201d. Partos said the score was designed to give an insight into the protagonist\u2019s state of mind. In the documentary section, the Brett Whiteley documentary, Whiteley, took out four of the five awards it was nominated for, including best direction, best editing, best original music score and best sound. Cleverman took home the best hair and makeup award for television for the second year in a row, and War on Waste won best documentary television program. Utopia won best TV comedy series for the second time, while Casting JonBen\u00e9t won best feature film documentary. Kitty Green, director of Casting JonBen\u00e9t, said she hoped her win would inspire other young women to push for recognition in the industry. \u201cPeople take one look at you and assume you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou come up against that [resistance] a lot and eventually what I did was put my head down and made my own stuff.\u201d The Aactas also introduced a new best online video or series category this year, which was won by RackaRacka, a YouTube channel run by 24-year-old Adelaide twins Danny and Michael Philippou, known for their bizarre battle videos, one of which recently included a lightsaber combat sequence in a supermarket car park. Other winners included Little Lunch for best children\u2019s television series and Australian Survivor for best direction in a television light entertainment, lifestyle or reality series."
"4||Monday briefing: Brexit faces hold up on the Irish borderTop story: Another day, another crunch meeting for PM Good morning. A happy Monday to you. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and this is the Guardian\u2019s morning briefing. It must feel like Groundhog Day for Theresa May: another meeting in Brussels, another day being billed as crucial for the Brexit process. This time the big problem is that she has failed to sort out the problem of the Irish border in time for today\u2019s talks with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. The lack of progress, revealed by the Irish government on Sunday night, could mean that the Brexit negotiations can\u2019t move on to the second stage, which is all about trade and Britain\u2019s future relationship with Europe. The border issue, along with the question of citizens\u2019 rights and the UK\u2019s divorce payment, must be settled in time for an EU council meeting in 10 days\u2019 time when leaders will decide if \u201csufficient progress\u201d has been made to proceed to the next phase. On another Brexit battlefront, a leading winemaker has said that Britons \u201cwill starve\u201d if European migrants are prevented from working on our farms. Frazer Thompson, the boss of Chapel Down, which supplies wine to 10 Downing Street, said: \u201cThe biggest potential impact of Brexit is on agricultural labour. Kent has had eastern Europeans picking fruit in recent years, but we\u2019ll all starve if the labour issue is not sorted after Brexit.\u201d But before you start stockpiling food, help is at hand. Tony Blair has told BBC radio that he is working to reverse the Brexit decision because the \u201c\u00a3350m a week\u201d promise of the leave campaign has been exposed as untrue. * * * Poverty trap \u2013 Hundreds of thousands of children and old people have slipped into poverty in the past four years as falling wage growth and rising inflation take their toll on household budgets. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that 400,000 more children and 300,000 more pensioners were living in poverty last year compared with 2012-13. The foundation said the government should reverse the freeze on benefits, increase training for adult workers and adopt a bigger house-building programme to provide affordable homes for struggling families. * * * Trump tribulation \u2013 The intrigue surrounding former US national security adviser Michael Flynn deepened overnight as legal experts voiced surprise that one of Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers sought to take the blame for a tweet by the president that could show he broke the law. In Saturday\u2019s (possibly) offending tweet, Trump said he fired Flynn in February for lying to VP Mike Pence and the FBI. But that would mean Trump knew Flynn had committed a serious crime when the president allegedly asked former FBI chief James Comey the next day to halt an investigation into Flynn. Enter Trump attorney John Dowd, who says he composed the tweet but made a \u201csloppy\u201d error. Trump\u2019s notorious \u201cgrab em by the pussy\u201d remarks were also thrust back to centre stage on Sunday when Billy Bush, the former TV host present when Trump made the taped comments, dismissed suggestions by the president that the recording was a fake, saying: \u201cOf course he said it.\u201d * * * Scandal-hit aid scheme suspended \u2013 The government has suspended a multimillion-pound foreign aid scheme amid allegations that the funds are ending up in the hands of jihadi fighters in Syria. The Ajacs project was set up in 2014 to help establish civilian police forces in rebel-held parts of Syria but a BBC Panorama investigation has alleged that officers were being forced to hand cash to extremists. The programme, which will be shown on BBC1 tonight, also claims that the Syrian branch of al-Qaida, Jabhat al-Nusra, handpicked police officers for two stations in Idlib province and that dead or fictitious people were on the payroll. Adam Smith International, the British company which runs the scheme, strongly denies the allegations. * * * Test changes stalled \u2013 The biggest overhaul of the driving test for more than 20 years could be stalled after examiners said they would go on strike because they say the changes will require them to work longer hours for no extra pay. Members of the Public and Commercial Services union will picket test centres across Britain today and tomorrow after 84% voted in favour of a strike described as \u201cshameless\u201d by bosses. The industrial action could nevertheless give candidates an extra 48 hours to practise new skills such as following instructions on a satnav, increasing their pre-test independent driving hours and entering parking bays, which replaces the outdated manoeuvre of reversing around a corner. * * * Starry night for science \u2013 Morgan Freeman was the host and celebrities included Mila Kunis, Kerry Washington and Miss USA 2017 K\u00e1ra McCullough. But this wasn\u2019t another Hollywood awards night. Instead it was the glitziest night in the scientific calendar as the Breakthrough awards handed out $22m in prize money to some of the world\u2019s leading brains. Winners included five researchers who won $3m (\u00a32.2m) each for their work on cell biology, plant science and neurodegenerative diseases, two mathematicians, and a team of 27 physicists who mapped the primordial light that warmed the universe moments after the big bang 13.8bn years ago.

Pep Guardiola praised Manchester City\u2019s increasing ability to win in \u201cFergie time\u201d after West Ham United were beaten by David Silva\u2019s 83rd-minute strike, to make it three successive matches his side have served up a late, late show in the manner of Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson. Meanwhile, Swansea City\u2019s calamitous season is going from bad to worse after it emerged their players turned on one another in a heated row in the wake of their chastening defeat at Stoke City. Having completed his first tournament in 12 months at the Hero World Challenge \u2013 won by Rickie Fowler \u2013 Tiger Woods has declared his intention to play regularly in 2018. And, angry at a holding call late in the NFL game against New York Jets, Kansas City cornerback Marcus Peters threw a penalty flag into the crowd and ejected himself, before later returning \u2013 without socks. Business The financial markets resemble the pre-crash era and are in danger of overheating, the Bank of International Settlements has warned in its quarterly health check.

"6||Big banks putting UK's free-to-use ATM network at risk, warns peerThe public should be told whether the big banks are refusing to support a free-to-use cash machine network, according to the politician who led the campaign a decade ago to maintain access to ATMs around the UK. Proposals to change the way the Link network operates have prompted fears that up to 10,000 of the 55,000 free-to-use ATMs could either close or start charging. John McFall, who chaired the Treasury select committee for nine years until 2010, has now waded into the debate by urging the network to publish the responses to a consultation on its plan to cut the interchange fee that card providers pay to machine operators every time a customer withdraws cash. It would fall from 25p to 20p under the plan. \u201cThe public has a right to know where each of the major banks stands on these proposals and whether they are reneging on their commitment to support a widespread network of free-to-use ATMs,\u201d said Lord McFall, adding that the network was taking a \u201cleap in the dark\u201d as it did not know what the impact might be. \u201cKeeping their responses secret will do nothing for the trust of the public, which they are committed to re-establishing. It is unacceptable that this consultation is dominated by the views of the major banks and excludes the public and consumer groups which are not members of the Link consumer council.\u201d The consumer council was set up in 2006 and counts an MP, charities, banks and ATM providers among its members. Link has 30 members ranging from high street banks and building societies to the private companies which install machines around the UK. McFall conducted an inquiry into cash machines in 2005, while chair of the select committee, and later chaired a working party that devised a framework to keep ATMs free in low-income areas. He said the ATM network was becoming increasingly important in the light of branch closures. RBS announced plans on Friday to close 259 branches, a quarter of its network. Link, said the responses to the consultation \u2013 which closed last week \u2013 contained \u201ccommercially confidential inputs\u201d and would remain confidential. \u201cLink\u2019s policy remains to maintain extensive free ATM coverage. That is not changing. Providing free ATMs across the country, particularly in areas where other mechanisms, such as branches, are not available, remains key to Link\u2019s objectives and continues to be successfully achieved,\u201d John Howells, the chief executive of Link, said in a statement. The current system, he said, was leading to ATMs clustering in busy locations, whilst leaving more remote areas exposed to the risk of closure. He told Mail Online over the weekend that cash machines would disappear from high streets altogether in 10 years, with retailers becoming more important in dispensing cash from their tills."
"7||If Damian Green harassed a woman or lied, he must goTo change the controversy, change the question. In July 2003, Joseph C Wilson, a former US ambassador, wrote a New York Times article casting serious doubt on President Bush\u2019s claim that Saddam Hussein had been seeking uranium in Niger. This posed the question: why did we go to war in Iraq? A week later, a Washington Post columnist disclosed, on the basis of confidential briefings, that Wilson\u2019s wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA operative. Suddenly the question changed to: who is this man married to, and what is the couple\u2019s agenda? As a distraction, it worked a treat: Plame\u2019s career in intelligence lay in ruins, and Wilson\u2019s revelation about the limitations of Saddam\u2019s WMD programme was lost in a Washington soap opera. Compare the behaviour of Damian Green\u2019s allies in the past three days. On 1 November, the writer and critic Kate Maltby reported that he had made sexual advances towards her in 2015 and 2016. Four days later, the Sunday Times reported that police had found pornography on a computer seized from Green\u2019s parliamentary office in 2008. On Friday, in a BBC exclusive on the Today programme, Neil Lewis, a former Scotland Yard detective, declared that he had \u201cabsolutely no doubt whatsoever\u201d, after forensic analysis of the machine, that Green had accessed \u201cthousands\u201d of pornographic images. The first secretary of state strongly denies all the allegations, which are now under investigation by Sue Gray, the Cabinet Office\u2019s head of propriety and ethics. As her title suggests, her job is to establish whether Green behaved appropriately and in a manner befitting the de facto deputy prime minister. Since Friday, however, his senior supporters have tried, with some success, to change the question. What they now ask, with the cold fury of Tories clutching Magna Carta, is whether the police are conducting a vendetta against Green, disclosing private information and politicising law enforcement. Wrists have already been slapped and you can bet that further investigations will be mounted in the long-running feud between the embattled cabinet minister and the police. But let us not be so easily swayed by the studied outrage of the Green camp. It is perfectly possible that certain former coppers do not like him very much, but that what they have alleged is also completely true. On the question of Green\u2019s allegedly epic consumption of porn, I imagine that if this is proved, most people will be wondering why an MP can get away with behaviour for which almost every employee in the land would be sacked. To put it crudely: does parliamentary privilege extend to the wrist? And if so, why? What really matters, though, is that we do not lose sight of the broader picture. Gray has a formidable task. It is not her job to say whether or not MPs should watch smut in their offices: that unenviable responsibility is borne by Kathryn Hudson, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, who oversees the rules, and recommends action to the Commons committee on standards in public life. But it is most certainly Gray\u2019s job in this case to assess whether Green has told lies about his alleged consumption of porn, just as she must judge whether he is telling the truth about the alleged sexual misconduct. Full disclosure: I am a good friend of Maltby and was so at the time of the alleged incidents (though I did not hear about them until her decision to go into print). I am astonished by the suggestion that she is making these claims as a publicity stunt or to climb on a bandwagon. I mean, really: who would want, just for fun, to subject themselves to door-stepping by journalists, family intrusion and a two-page character assassination by the Daily Mail? Still, I recognise that I must recuse myself from this particular case. It is widely assumed that Gray is considering only Maltby\u2019s allegations. We don\u2019t know whether this is in fact the case or whether there are other complainants. If there are, their allegations should also be addressed by the Gray inquiry. As I asked last month: was anyone now working in Downing Street warned about any allegations of sexual harassment against Green when he was appointed work and pensions secretary in July 2016, or to his current post in June? And if they were, how did they respond? If you imagine that I write all this with relish, excited at the possibility of a ministerial scalp, you are dead wrong. For more than 20 years I have praised Green in writing and in person as one of the few senior Tories who grasped the need for root-and-branch reform of the party. In July, as most Conservatives made excuses and sought scapegoats for the party\u2019s pathetic election performance, he had the clarity of insight to insist that \u201cwe need to think hard, work hard, and change hard.\u201d But that is precisely why there is such a strong sense of apprehension and anger among Conservative modernisers, especially women MPs and activists, who feel that Green may have betrayed utterly what they have fought for and what they believed he stood for. Since the long campaign to drain the poison from the Tory party began in the mid-90s, gender equality has been at its heart, as has the principle that those in power should not abuse it and that the Conservative aura of entitlement is one of the party\u2019s gravest electoral liabilities. Needless to say it will be a disaster for Theresa May if Green is not given a clean bill of health by the Cabinet Office inquiry. But it will also be a serious setback for those who have struggled for decades to persuade voters that the Tory party is not a tribe of self-serving sexists, bigots and xenophobes. If Damian Green is found to be a sex pest, what hope for the rest of them? That\u2019s the politics of the controversy. But the matter before Gray is one of simple ethics: did this man behave unacceptably towards women, and did he lie about that and other matters to the prime minister, the media and the public? If he did, he will have to go. And if he does, he will not be the victim of a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d, a police stitch-up, or a smear campaign, but of his own conduct, his depleted sense of right and wrong, and his disloyalty to the very principles for which he once stood. \u2022 Matthew d\u2019Ancona is a Guardian columnist"
"34||The fairytale of York: two panto champs on their Christmas miracleMartin Barrass: \u2018I was told I had a 1% chance of survival\u2019 I got a motorbike last year, in the spring. Then, on a bright sunny day in September, a car pulled out of a little side road, and I hit it at about 50mph. The Yorkshire Air Ambulance saved my life. My heart had stopped for about five minutes, both lungs had collapsed and I had 17 broken ribs and a broken leg. Earlier this year, when I went back to thank the hospitals that had treated me \u2013 Leeds General Infirmary and Jimmy\u2019s in Leeds \u2013 I was told my chance of survival had been about 1%. They said: \u201cWe don\u2019t use this word lightly, but it\u2019s a miracle recovery.\u201d I was in hospital for eight weeks, with about five days in an induced coma in intensive care. There was no way I was able to do last year\u2019s panto \u2013 I was still walking with a frame, and I only wanted to lie in bed. It was the first York Theatre Royal pantomime I\u2019d missed since I started in 1984. I was out of hospital in time to go to the press night, and I was brought on stage at the end. I was down to about seven stone (44kg), and looked quite gaunt, and I was so choked by the reaction \u2013 it was kind of a standing ovation. I was back working in January this year, rehearsing for a Royal Shakespeare Company and Hull Truck Theatre play, The Hypocrite. At first I couldn\u2019t put on my heavy costume by myself \u2013 I was playing the lord mayor of Hull. I hoped my stamina would hold out, and I discovered that with each week that went by I was getting stronger and stronger. I do feel like I did before the crash and now I\u2019m chomping at the bit to do this year\u2019s panto, Jack and the Beanstalk \u2013 I\u2019m playing Jack\u2019s idiot brother, Stanley Manly. Our mum is Mandy Manly, played by Berwick Kaler. I\u2019m biased, but I think the York Theatre Royal panto is the best. I first saw one of their pantos in 1979 \u2013 it was Dick Whittington, and a couple of mates were in it, along with Gary Oldman playing the cat. I love the anarchy of pantomime, and it is uniquely British \u2013 I think it mixes the madness of Monty Python with music hall. The art of panto is in its energy. People from all walks of life come to it, all laughing at the same gags. Berwick Kaler: \u2018They bust open my ribs and stopped my heart\u2019 I had a pacemaker fitted last year, but this year I was told I would need a heart bypass. It didn\u2019t happen until late July, and it\u2019s supposed to take six months to recover but I thought: \u201cI don\u2019t need six months to get over it.\u201d But that is why, a week before the actors were due to start rehearsing, there was still no second half \u2013 because I hadn\u2019t got it written. I\u2019m 71, and recovering from the operation just made me very tired. I was in hospital for about five or six days. They bust open my ribs and took a vein from my upper leg, and stopped my heart for a while. My operation wasn\u2019t as dramatic as Martin\u2019s after his motorbike accident \u2013 and I\u2019m furious about that. This will be my 39th panto in York as the dame, but it will be my 49th pantomime in total \u2013 I used to play the villain in shows all over the country. My first panto in York, in 1978, was terrible \u2013 the script was awful and had been around for years, the sets were falling down. I started ad-libbing, which the audience loved. After a few years, I started writing the pantomime \u2013 I thought, yes, it will be rubbish, but at least it will be our own rubbish. I never thought I would stay in York all this time, but I became passionate about it when the audience started telling me how much they looked forward to our pantomime. They\u2019ve sort of created it with me. I\u2019m not going to go on forever but I\u2019m still as passionate about pantomime as I was when I first started. The passion that the audience has for the pantomime is unique, it\u2019s a bond between the audience and the artists on stage. We\u2019ve had a birth in the theatre because the mother didn\u2019t want to miss her annual pantomime \u2013 the baby was born in the bar. You\u2019ve got to work the lines with every fibre of your being. You have to work for your laughs and make it look easy, but just changing costume is one of the most tiring things a dame can do. I think people are booking to see if I can make it to the end of the run. Jack and the Beanstalk is at York Theatre Royal, 14 December-3 February. Box office: 01904 623568."
"5||Nomad stores: the latest sign of gentrificationEleven years ago, east London restaurant Bistrotheque \u2013 an early frontrunner of the bare bulb/subway-tile aesthetic \u2013 opened The Reindeer in a large car park in an east London brewery. Billed as the city\u2019s first pop-up restaurant, such was the hype that it fed more than 20,000 people in three weeks. The financial crisis of 2008 consolidated the pop-up method as the easiest route to starting a new business during the following decade. For landlords, it was the best way to let unused space \u2013 and for retailers to take a punt without the costs of a long-term lease. But what seemed like a hip new way to shift, say, juice, was actually proof of the volatility of the high street. With that in mind, what should we make of the latest retail neologism \u2013 the nomad store \u2013 shops that open up in any given location when the time suits? Coined by hip London boutique Browns, its first nomad \u201cproject\u201d opened in east London this autumn. Inside it looks cool and warehouse-y. There are concertina doors, lots of mirrors, artwork by Polly Morgan and fresh brownies. Browns describes it as \u201csemi-permanent\u201d yet \u201croaming\u201d (a pop-up will eventually end) and a \u201c21st-century response to the pop-up model\u201d, which means no one knows when it will open, when it will close and what it will be. There is no formula. The shop can be dismantled in a few hours with no prior warning (although there is no plan to do so because it\u2019s doing quite well). The other point of the nomad store is that it is designed to reflect its location \u2013 here, the focus is on being \u201cgender-fused\u201d, a clunky phrase that essentially means you can have Balenciaga on a rail next to Raf Simons. It\u2019s a sort of ambulance-chaser of gentrification. When east London falls short, the \u201cnomad project\u201d will move on to the next place. Eddie Blake, senior architect at Sam Jacob Studio (who lives nearby), thinks the term is a misnomer. He says it\u2019s \u201cthe force of capital that makes this stuff nomadic \u2013 not a romantic attachment to roaming\u201d. Gordon Fletcher, retail expert at the University of Salford, is more sympathetic, saying they \u201cfeed into the wider trend for variety and variability ... [creating] a sense of urgency that, when coupled with a consumer\u2019s desire to be different, works\u201d. What\u2019s more, the unpredictability of nomad shops suggests we are \u201cincreasingly comfortable with a gig economy and the lack of permanence\u201d, so their success is our fault. Nomad shops like this feel more interesting than pop-ups. And with an estimated 8,000 stores closing this year, shops need to change. Becoming a nomad is simply one way."
"26||Facebook's new London office brings 800 jobs to the capitalFacebook will create 800 new jobs in London over the next year, increasing its UK workforce by more than 50%, as it opens a new office in the capital on Monday. The US tech giant has had offices in the UK for 10 years, but its expansion marks a vote of confidence in the UK amid the uncertainty of Brexit. By the end of next year, Facebook said it would employ more than 2,300 people in the UK and more than half of those at the London site would focus on engineering, making it the company\u2019s biggest engineering hub outside the US. The Frank Gehry-designed offices in Rathbone Place, just off Oxford Street, will also house developer, marketing and sales teams. It will also be home to LDN_LAB, a scheme under which tech startups will be invited to take part in three-month programmes designed to help accelerate their development. Facebook will be looking for an initial five to six startups to join the first programme with applications starting on Monday. The company\u2019s engineering, product and other experts will give their time to support a planned 20 startups next year. Nicola Mendelsohn, vice-president of Facebook\u2019s European operations, said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcements show that Facebook is more committed than ever to the UK and in supporting the growth of the country\u2019s innovative startups. \u201cThe UK\u2019s flourishing entrepreneurial ecosystem and international reputation for engineering excellence makes it one of the best places in the world to build a tech company. And we\u2019ve built our company here \u2013 this country has been a huge part of Facebook\u2019s story over the past decade, and I look forward to continuing our work.\u201d The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cThe UK is not only the best place to start a new business, it\u2019s also the best place to grow one. It\u2019s a sign of confidence in our country that innovative companies like Facebook invest here.\u201d Facebook\u2019s bet on London comes after Amazon opened a new HQ in the capital this summer, where it said it would double the number of R\u2019n\u2019D staff to 900. It expected to expand its UK workforce to 24,000 by the end of this year. Google has, meanwhile, confirmed plans to build a new head office in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district and create 3,000 jobs. The 11-storey \u201clandscraper\u201d, designed by Thomas Heatherwick, the man behind the new London bus and the 2012 Olympic cauldron, will be as long as the Shard is tall. It forms part of Google\u2019s London campus, which will house 7,000 employees. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cThe emphasis on engineering and the 800 new jobs being created [by Facebook] shows London remains at the forefront of global innovation. What\u2019s more, the launch of the company\u2019s incubator is set to play a crucial role in attracting vital talent to London and will help to pave the way for the next generation of successful startups.\u201d \u2022 A picture caption was amended on 6 December 2017. An earlier version referred to the exterior of Facebook\u2019s new London office, and said it was designed by Frank Gehry. The exterior of Facebook\u2019s new London office was designed by Make architects; Frank Gehry designed the interior of the offices."
"22||Change of heart: can we do better for heart patients than a transplant?In the early hours of 3 December 1967, Prof Christiaan Barnard gazed down into the void and felt a chill ripple through his veins as he considered the historic nature of what he was about to attempt. The gaping chasm lying before him was the empty chest cavity of a 54-year-old former boxer called Louis Washkansky. Barnard had just removed Washkansky\u2019s heart, a bloated organ left ravaged and scarred by repeated coronary attacks, and now he had just minutes to try to save his life by inserting a heart taken from Denise Darvall, a 25-year-old woman left brain dead after being struck by a car that day. At the time, cardiac transplant surgery was barely a decade old, pioneered by a handful of individuals who had developed a radical method of switching a heart from one body to another \u2013 but all previous transplants had been done in dogs. As they worked to stitch the new organ into Washkansky\u2019s body and then shock it into life, Barnard and his team were improvising, guided only by a few dozen animal studies, the suggestions of scientific papers and their own instinct. But at 6.13am, after almost four hours of surgery, Washkansky\u2019s transplanted heart started to stir. As Barnard would write: \u201cLittle by little it began to roll with the lovely rhythm of life.\u201d It would prove to be a defining moment in the history of medical science. While Washkansky himself would die of pneumonia just 18 days later, his body weakened by intensive antirejection treatment, his case paved the way for hundreds of heart transplants in the following years. Now, 50 years on from Barnard\u2019s achievement, 4,000 heart transplants are performed around the world each year. But while some patients live for decades, complications persist due to the need for constant immunosuppressant treatment, meaning the survival rate after 12 years is still just 50%. In addition, while studies in the US have found that more than 20,000 Americans could benefit from a heart transplant each year, just 2,000 transplants are performed there due to a shortage of donors. But many scientists believe we are on the verge of a new medical revolution. Advances in regenerative medicine will allow us to repair damaged hearts instead of replacing them. In all mammals, it\u2019s almost impossible for a damaged heart to repair itself. Within minutes of being deprived of oxygen due to a blocked artery, the heart\u2019s muscle cells start to die. If surgeons are able to tackle the blockage within one hour, the damage can be reversed. If 12 hours have passed, up to 1bn heart cells may already be lost, replaced only by tough, rigid scar tissue. \u201cThe problem is that the regenerative power of the heart is lower than other organs,\u201d says Dr Tim Henry, director of cardiology at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \u201cIf you lose half your liver, it will grow back. Your skin heals completely very quickly. But for people whose heart failure isn\u2019t treated in time, or who have already had one heart attack, there\u2019s permanent, significant damage which leaves them requiring a transplant.\u201d Over the past 15 years, scientists have experimented with taking stem cells from the blood or bone marrow and injecting them into badly damaged hearts. This typically works well in improving blood flow to the heart, helping patients who have bad blockages in their arteries. But despite numerous attempts, these individual stem cells have been unable to grow back much of the lost heart muscle. The body\u2019s immune responses are so hostile to new cells implanted into the heart that even when the patient\u2019s own tissue is used, 90% of the cells still die. \u201cThe stem cell approach has shown some benefit, but it\u2019s been relatively short-lived,\u201d says Prof Richard Farndale of the University of Cambridge. \u201cWhat generally happens is that the stem cells fail to attach to the heart and are lost into the bloodstream fairly quickly.\u201d However, a new approach appears to hold a lot more promise. Scientists are growing \u201cheart patches\u201d, tiny beating pieces of heart muscle, in small dishes in the lab. They are made by taking a drop of blood from a patient and engineering the blood cells into a layer of fully formed cardiac tissue. This is genetically matched to that person, and can be engrafted into the heart to replace damaged areas. This has been tested in mice and will soon be tested in pigs. In the next five years, scientists hope to launch a clinical trial to apply the patches in humans. At a cost of about \u00a370,000 a patient, it promises to be a far more economically viable alternative to heart transplants, which, with the huge surgical teams required, cost the NHS up to \u00a3500,000. \u201cThe hope is that by providing a patch of tissue which already beats and contracts, instead of just individual cells, the body\u2019s built-in programming will take over and assimilate it into the heart as if it was already there,\u201d says Tim Kamp, professor of regenerative biology, who builds heart patches at the University of Wisconsin. One of the challenges in coming years is to ensure that the new patch electrically integrates with the heart so that both beat in synchrony. Scientists hope that because the patch will be so similar to the existing heart muscle, natural bodily processes will take over. \u201cWe anticipate this will happen, but we have to make sure and be really cautious,\u201d Kamp says. \u201cThe heart isn\u2019t a USB socket which we can just plug things into. For patients with severe heart failure, the whole heart dilates to try to adapt to the damage. It changes shape from being like a football to a big basketball. But we hope these patches will be able to heal a much larger area of damage than single cell injections. And if multiple patches are required to replace multiple areas of scarring, we can put those in. This technology may really provide a whole avenue of hope for people with these conditions who badly need new treatments.\u201d"
"18||Howards End review: No rollicking finale \u2013 just wit and humanityIt\u2019s the awkward morning after the day before at Howards End (BBC One). Actually, at Oniton in Shropshire \u2013 it\u2019s hard to keep up with the Wilcox\u2019s property portfolio, I know. Oniton is in \u201cthe wrong part of Shropshire\u201d it turns out, mainly because of a lack of game; it looks pretty nice to me, pheasants or not. We\u2019re there for silly Evie Wilcox\u2019s wedding, remember? And for our three families \u2013 Wilcoxes, Schlegels and Basts \u2013 to collide, dramatically and drastically. And for Henry Wilcox\u2019s dirty secret past, with Jacky in Cyprus, to catch up with him, for which he has told Margaret she is released from their engagement. Now the two of them are having breakfast together, awkwardly. For Margaret it\u2019s not all over, she is prepared to overlook something that happened long before they even met. He can\u2019t even look at her, let alone talk about it. The scene lasts about four minutes, which might not sound long but four minutes is a long time in TV drama, especially when it\u2019s just two people not saying very much. But actually there is loads going on here, about who they are, where they\u2019re from and what they think: she is generous and forgiving and is led by her heart and intellect; he is cold and stuffed up and conventional, feeling doesn\u2019t come easily. I\u2019ve heard a few moans about the pace of Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s adaptation. But the pace, and the long scenes, are a big part of its strength; it\u2019s bold rather than ponderous. The moaners maybe expected more frocks and bonnets, carriages, chaps on horses, heaving chests, upstairs-downstairs, will-they-won\u2019t-they (get married). Downton, in a word. There is a bit of that going on here: pretty frocks, handsome country houses, hansom cabs, now the occasional motorcar. Lovely period detail, but it doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s the centre of attention, which in my book (adaptation) is a good thing. This is about bigger, more important things: people and ideas. A load has already been said about the relevance of Howards End today, with the changing world, widening wealth divide, lack of social mobility, etc. This deftly tosses race in there as well, adding without interfering or taking anything away. But what it has done best of all is characters and the relationships between them, not just between the families and their social strata, but within them, too. And particularly between Margaret and Helen Schlegel, of course, for which Hayley Atwell and Philippa Coulthard need a cheer. As well as all the A-level English themes, class and culture, connecting, gender roles, it has been a wonderful portrait of two women, two sisters, very different, but also very much part of each other. Shout out to Alex Lawther as little brother Tibby, too, for providing pretty much the only thin seam of humour. Tibby is now learning Chinese, of course. Back in the breakfast room, after a small distraction about a little gong, which came from Harrods, Margaret gets Henry back again. The wedding will go ahead, later it gets 25 seconds of screen time, really just to illustrate a line in a letter Margaret is writing to Helen. Four minutes for awkward breakfast, less than half for nuptials. In Downton, the wedding would have taken up half the episode, with bridesmaids and tears, the works. Different priorities. This is Howards End (and it really is, Lonergan says that three quarters of the words are cut straight from the novel, Filet o\u2019 Forster). Downton is more like Howards\u2019 Way. While Margaret and Henry are breakfasting, Helen is waking to another kind of awkwardness: uh-oh, she\u2019s pregnant. Via Leonard Bast, while Jacky was upstairs in bed, feeling poorly (as well as poor). Being pregnant while single was very awkward a century ago, even for an enlightened, progressive Schlebel; she has to disappear to Germany to hide her shame, only returning when Aunt Juley is poorly, too. Which leads back to Howards End and another, even more fateful meeting between the three families. In a rare moment of action, Charles Wilcox knocks a bookshelf over while thrashing Leonard for his caddishness, and that\u2019s it, Leonard\u2019s End. Killed by books \u2013 there\u2019s irony there; that\u2019ll teach him. On the plus side, the ghastly Charles is later sent to prison and Margaret gets the house as she was meant to all along. Just the one moan, the usual one: music. Too loud, too much, too omnipresent. A little silence would have suited this Howards End well. Otherwise it has been a treat. What it lacked in rollicking, it made up for with thoughtfulness, humanity, wit and words. And timelessness; don\u2019t forget impending doom in Europe ..."
"35||Sadiq Khan plans network of London water fountains to reduce plastic wasteLondon\u2019s mayor Sadiq Khan wants to roll out a new network of water fountains and bottle-refill stations across the capital to help reduce the use of single-use packaging, such as plastic water bottles, the Guardian has learned. The mayor also wants to experiment with getting businesses to make their tap water available to the public, building on a scheme launched two years ago in Bristol. A million plastic bottles are bought worldwide every minute, and annual consumption is expected to surpass half a trillion bottles by 2021. A large proportion wind up buried in landfill sites or littering the ocean, with figures revealing that more than half of the plastic bottles bought in 2016 were not collected for recycling. \u201cThe mayor wants to see a reduction in the amount of single-use plastic bottles and cups across the capital and has asked City Hall officers to examine the feasibility of a pilot community water refill scheme, or other interventions,\u201d said a spokesperson for Khan, adding that the mayor has also written to the government to discuss trialling a deposit return scheme in London and would like London\u2019s businesses to make tap water available to the public. \u201cSadiq supports boroughs in identifying suitable locations for water fountains and bottle-refill stations during the planning process in new or redeveloped public spaces, such as town centres, shopping malls, parks and squares,\u201d the spokesperson added, pointing to Khan\u2019s blueprint for London, which is open for consultation until March 2018. \u201cFree drinking-water fountains that can refill water bottles, as well as be drunk from, should be provided in appropriate locations in new or redeveloped public realm,\u201d the report notes, adding that such locations include busy pedestrian areas, parks and squares. The mayor appears to be joining an incipient movement to challenge the inexorable spread of plastic. Retailers such as Pret a Manger, JD Wetherspoon and even London Zoo have indicated that they want to curb their plastic usage, and last month Jamie Oliver also called for more drinking stations to be installed to provide \u201ca free and greener alternative to sugary drinks\u201d. In addition, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has revealed that greater access to drinking fountains across the country is being considered as part of the government\u2019s bid to cut plastic waste. Enthusiastically rolled out by Victorian philanthropists for public health and temperance reasons, water fountains were once far more abundant than they are today: the current provision around London and England\u2019s metropolitan boroughs shows vast disparities. Exclusive data gathered by the Guardian reveals that while the borough of Lambeth has 25 drinking fountains around its parks and open spaces, many others, including Sutton, Enfield and Haringey, have none \u2013 and no plans to install any. A similar dearth was found across England\u2019s urban hubs: not one of the councils across Manchester, Merseyside or South Yorkshire \u2013 encompassing Sheffield, Doncaster, Barnsley and Rotherham \u2013 reported having any drinking fountains in parks or town centres, with those that had been installed were decommissioned. And it remains to be seen whether Gove and Khan\u2019s ambitions will be realised. Khan\u2019s predecessor, Boris Johnson, also announced \u201ca new era of public fountains\u201d in 2008, but did not follow through. \u201cUnder the previous mayoralty, several proposals for providing water fountains and water bottle refill stations were explored but there were concerns over high installation costs,\u201d a spokesperson for Khan told the Guardian. But the Guardian has established that costs are negligible. Documents regarding the installation of a drinking fountain in Shrewsbury Park, Greenwich, suggests it would cost about \u00a36,000. A spokesperson for Tower Hamlets, which has 11 drinking fountains and is considering installing a further two, said that the decision to install fountains tended to be made when refurbs of parks and playgrounds were being undertaken, and after consultation with the public. A survey by YouGov and Keep Britain Tidy earlier this year revealed that 70% of individuals questioned agreed that tap water should be more freely available, while 59% said they would be more likely to reuse a water bottle if they could easily fill it in shops, parks and other locations. Paul O\u2019Connell, a trustee of the Drinking Fountain Association that was set up in 1859, said that while budget cuts appeared to be behind the decommissioning of existing fountains by councils, commercial considerations might also play a role in decisions over whether to install fountains. He said that, for example, seven years ago, Network Rail admitted that it did not want new drinking points on its stations, in part because it would undermine retailers. In a letter to O\u2019Connell, seen by the Guardian and dated February 2010, a transport ministry official noted that Network Rail believed that \u201cinstalling water fountains would take away the revenue that retailers receive from the sale of bottled water (and other drinks) and rents that Network Rail receives from retailers is a significant source of revenue\u201d. When contacted by the Guardian, a Network Rail spokesperson said that water fountains were not, and would not, be installed in stations, but refused to give a rationale. \u201cWater fountains are not a facility we currently have in stations and there are currently no plans to do so,\u201d the spokesperson said. While O\u2019Connell said he welcomed the plans from the London mayor, he warned that promises to boost the number of water fountains had been made before, to little effect. \u201cObviously, we have been here before,\u201d he said. But, he added, the approach could bring many benefits if installed in the right locations, from aiding public health, to saving money and helping the environment. \u201cThere is a lot of waste caused by single-use plastic and it\u2019s a basic human need to have drinking water,\u201d he said."

"21||Loneliness of Greta Garbo laid bare as letters put up for saleThe woman in the photographs is almost unrecognisable as one of the most famously solitary stars of the 20th century: striding out on skis across a snowy landscape, chopping logs, sunbathing topless, cradling an armful of puppies \u2013 it is Greta Garbo, laughing among cherished friends. The woman who emerges from letters carefully preserved for a lifetime by her friends along with the private album, and now to be sold at a Sotheby\u2019s auction, is heartbreakingly different from the sociable, jolly figure in the photos. They were written when Garbo was back in the United States, despairing over feeble scripts, raging at stupid directors, terrified of the verdict of critics, which could be no harsher than her own. In the 1932 film Grand Hotel, Garbo muttered the memorable line \u201cI want to be alone\u201d, and she never escaped that quote. The letters show that when she was alone she was achingly lonely. In 1945, four years into self-imposed retirement after the failure of her last film, Two-Faced Woman, she wrote: \u201cI have been considering a film I might try making but I don\u2019t know. Time leaves its traces on our small faces and bodies.\u201d When she was working on one of her most famous films, Queen Christina, in 1933, she wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult time, it all went wrong. I\u2019m half-done with Christina now and half-done is what she\u2019s going to be when she\u2019s finished.\u201d Most of the letters were written from Beverly Hills, California, which she loathed. \u201cI am almost always alone and talk to myself. I drive to the beach and take walks and that\u2019s always marvellous. But that\u2019s it.\u201d In the sunshine of California, she missed even the Swedish rain: \u201cI have been thinking a lot about Tistad. About summers there when it rains and that marvellous melancholy enfolds us.\u201d She saw that Two-Faced Woman would be a disaster. \u201cBut since I would rather go walking in the country than fight for stories, it will have turned out like it has.\u201d Gabriel Heaton, a specialist in Sotheby\u2019s book department, said: \u201cThere is an almost unbearable depth of sadness and loneliness in these letters. It is striking that none of these letters are signed \u2013 one has \u2018The Clown\u2019 instead of a signature, a few have stick drawings of women. The desire to remain in the shadows, out of the limelight, is extreme \u2013 one feels there is something very, very wrong here.\u201d The letters were all written to a Swedish countess, Marta Wachtmeister, and were carefully kept in a box file shaped like a leather-bound volume, along with some stalkerish letters sent by an anonymous fan to Garbo care of her friend, gloatingly passing on \u2013 with many underlinings \u2013 every bad review. In 1936, Garbo was making bleak jokes about the abdication crisis: \u201cDear Mrs Simpson, now her quiet days are over. She will be pursued wherever she goes. Hope the camera hunters will scare her so much she will leave my king in peace.\u201d Garbo was born in Stockholm in 1905 and moved to the US in 1925, where she made 25 of her 28 films. She became increasingly reclusive in her later years, and died in New York in 1990. The countess and her handsome husband were introduced to Garbo through a mutual friend in the early 1930s. Garbo was invited to a new year party at their castle, and for winter and summer holidays for years after. They remained friends until Wachtmeister died in 1976. The only typed letter \u2013 most were written in pencil on cheap, shoddy paper \u2013 was addressed to the couple\u2019s daughter, and signed GG. \u201cPerhaps you never received the telegram I sent when your mother left us. If you did not, you could not know how deeply sad I was and am. Your parents meant very much to me. They are interwoven in my memory forever.\u201d The letters have been translated by another specialist in the department, Cecilie Gasseholm, who is Danish but speaks fluent Swedish. \u201cI spent two days shut up in a room with them and the sadness really got to me,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople would stick their heads around the door and ask if I was alright, and I would find myself saying: \u2018Go away, leave me alone\u2019.\u201d The 36 letters, which cover more than 100 pages, and the album of photographs will be auctioned at Sotheby\u2019s in London on 12 December, estimated at up to \u00a320,000."
"7||All the signs in the Russia probe point to Jared Kushner. Who next?Game of Trumps is about to get really bloody. With special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation moving ever closer to President Trump himself, it looks like someone inside the family is about to be sacrificed. With Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, pleading guilty last week to the charge of lying to the FBI, much more about the Russia scandal is now coming into focus. The Flynn flip was by far the most dramatic event so far in the investigation into alleged Russian interference in 2016\u2019s US presidential race. Flynn\u2019s evidence can only lead up the chain of power towards Trump. Consider this chronology. On 23 November it was widely reported that Flynn had informed the Trump legal team that he could no longer discuss the case with them. The end of cooperation with Trump surely signalled the beginning of cooperation with Mueller. Two days later the New York Times and Washington Post carried nearly identical stories about Jared Kushner\u2019s waning influence. The Times story had three bylines, including Maggie Haberman, the president\u2019s go-to reporter. It concluded: \u201cMr Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, who had been in seemingly every meeting and every photograph, has lately disappeared from public view and, according to some colleagues, taken on a more limited role behind the scenes.\u201d Ashley Parker, who was a frontline reporter on the Trump campaign for the Times and now covers the White House for the Post, parroted virtually the same line in a story headlined \u201cThe shrinking profile of Jared Kushner\u201d. Someone high up in the White House seemed anxious for the word to spread. The Times story was attributed, in part, to three \u201cadvisers to the president\u201d. Parker\u2019s included an earlier interview with Kushner and came \u201cfrom interviews with Kushner himself, as well as 12 senior administration officials, aides, outside advisers and confidants, some speaking on condition of anonymity to offer a more candid assessment\u201d. Both stories raised the question of how long Kushner and his wife, Ivanka, the president\u2019s daughter, would remain in Washington. The Flynn plea deal makes clear that he was not acting as a lone ranger in his communications with Russian officials, including the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. Documents show that Flynn was told to call the Russians and other key international officials to discuss the sanctions President Obama was placing on Russia for interfering in the US election. Within minutes of the plea deal being announced, several news organisations reported that Kushner was the one directing Flynn\u2019s communications, which Flynn then lied about to the FBI. In the statement Flynn made about his guilty plea, he noted that he made the decision to cooperate because it was in the best interests of his family. No doubt this is a reference to his own son, Michael Flynn Jr, who worked for his father during the transition. Until now, Kushner has survived the fights that are common inside Trump\u2019s circle. During the campaign he dictated changes in the campaign leadership. In the White House, he won a bloody duel with Steve Bannon, whose hard-right, nationalist agenda was set back as a result. But Kushner\u2019s time may be up. The clues that Kushner has been pulling the strings on Russia are everywhere. Before the Trumps were even in the White House, he tried to set up a backchannel to communicate with the Russians. He then pushed Flynn hard to try to turn Russia around on an anti-Israel vote by the UN security council. Then there were the secret reassurances to the Russians that the Obama sanctions were nothing to worry about once Trump took office. Kushner was behind those machinations, too. What he told the president about firing former FBI director James Comey will be critical in assessing whether Kushner is also vulnerable to obstruction of justice charges. Those details are yet to leak. Other clues include that fishy meeting during the campaign to get dirt on Hillary Clinton from a Russian lawyer close to Putin. Kushner was there, too. And, during the transition, his meeting with a sanctioned Russian bank. There was also the failure to include some of these contacts on his initial federal disclosure forms. Declining power. Flynn turning state\u2019s witness. It doesn\u2019t look good for Kushner. When President Trump turned over his business empire to his two sons, he said that if they did a bad job he would not hesitate to say: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d The same is surely true for his son-in-law. But what Kushner fears more is Mueller saying: \u201cYou\u2019re charged.\u201d How he might deal with this, and what this might mean for President Trump, no one yet knows. \u2022 Jill Abramson is a political columnist for the Guardian"

"18||Monday\u2019s best TV: The Real Marigold on Tour, Employable Me, Addicted to PornThe Real Marigold on Tour 9pm, BBC One There\u2019s something irresistibly uplifting about this show, and in this series Miriam Margolyes, Wayne Sleep, Rosemary Shrager and Bobby George reunite to experience retired life around the world. The giggling foursome\u2019s first stop is Sichuan province in China. Stairlifts on the metro are welcome but the lack of beansprouts is a disappointment, and while Miriam melts after an encounter with a panda, Rosemary is unimpressed. Hannah Verdier Employable Me 9pm, BBC Two Continuing the series following jobseekers with disabilities seeking full-time work. Tonight, we meet Nicola, whose hundreds of applications and first-class journalism degree haven\u2019t helped her find work. Cerebral palsy hasn\u2019t dampened her determination, but repeated rejection has chipped away her confidence. Meanwhile, Marve\u2019s care-work experience should bring in opportunities, but his visual impairment is proving offputting to potential employers. Mark Gibbings-Jones Concorde: Designing the Dream 9pm, Channel 5 The first part of a workmanlike doc about Britain and France\u2019s joint emblem of postwar showing-off: the supersonic airliner. The technical challenges of breaking the sound barrier are laid out by pilots and engineers, as is the story of a feeble Soviet rival. It\u2019s a triumph of ingenuity over improbability, but mentions of Concorde\u2019s environmental impact leave room to question whether we should have built it, just because we could. Jack Seale Edgar Allan Poe: Buried Alive 9pm, PBS America This gloomy docudrama is a Poe biopic that pendulums from the master of the macabre\u2019s formative years as a Byron-loving wannabe to his mysterious death in Baltimore in 1849. As a vexed, clammy Poe, Denis O\u2019Hare addresses the viewer directly, which adds a certain unsettling charge to proceedings. There are also contributions from celebrity Poe-heads such as actor Chris Sarandon and B-movie maestro Roger Corman. Graeme Virtue The Art That Made Mexico: Paradise, Power and Prayers 9pm, BBC Four Mexico-born British artist Alinka Echeverr\u00eda has a theory about her homeland. She believes the art there is influenced by three forces: nature, power and religion. That lends itself to a three-part documentary series, which begins with a trip to the volcano-ringed, earthquake-ravaged Valley of Mexico. Before the conquistadors arrived, the art of the Teotihuacan and Aztecs was closely linked to this dramatic landscape. Ellen E Jones Handmade in Mexico 10pm, BBC Four Debut of a three-part series celebrating distinctly Mexican artworks, and meeting the artisans who still produce them. This episode focuses on the design and manufacture of signature items of Mexican clothing \u2013 the tunic known as the huipil, which has grown more decorative in recent years, and the more elaborate tehuana dress made by the Zapotec, as popularised internationally by the self-portraits of Frida Kahlo. Andrew Mueller Addicted to Porn 10pm, Really Joseph, 13, styles himself as \u201ca recovering porn addict\u201d. It\u2019s a dependence, he says, that was fuelled by the easy availability of explicit sexual imagery online. Joseph\u2019s is just one story in what is essentially an anti-porn doc set out as a kind of all-you-need-to-know guide to how the 21st-century hardcore industry works. Featuring contributions from both industry figures and anti-porn campaigners, it is, perhaps inevitably, grim viewing as it counts porn\u2019s human cost. Jonathan Wright TV films The Untouchables (Brian De Palma, 1987) 11am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Greats De Palma\u2019s big-screen homage to the 50s TV crime series is done in brilliant style and sharply scripted by David Mamet. Kevin Costner makes his name as upright fed Eliot Ness, pulling together a team of incorruptibles (Sean Connery, Andy Garcia, Charles Martin-Smith) to nail Robert De Niro\u2019s ferocious Al Capone in crime-racked 1930s Chicago. Some of the bloody violence harks back to De Palma\u2019s Scarface, but the Untouchables riding to battle on horseback, and the grand finale\u2019s homage to Eisenstein\u2019s Battleship Potemkin, are much lighter pastiche.

"0||Labor senator Katy Gallagher faces referral to high court over British citizenshipThe Labor senator Katy Gallagher faces referral to the high court because she was a British citizen on the nomination date for the 2016 election and may therefore be ineligible to sit in parliament. Documents made public in the Senate on Monday show that while Gallagher submitted forms to renounce her British citizenship on 20 April 2016, the renunciation was not confirmed until 16 August 2016, well after the 9 June nomination date. Gallagher, a former chief minister of the ACT, and Labor senator for the territory, claims she is still eligible to sit in parliament because, like Labor MPs Justine Keay and Susan Lamb and Nick Xenophon Team\u2019s Rebekha Sharkie, she took \u201call steps reasonably required\u201d by foreign law to renounce her dual citizenship. However, several constitutional law experts have warned it is arguable that reasonable steps are not enough to escape the constitutional disqualification on a strict reading of the high court\u2019s most recent decision in the citizenship seven case. The new eligibility declarations from all senators \u2013 a requirement imposed as a consequence of the dual citizenship debacle that has consumed the parliament for months \u2013 were released publicly on Monday. The Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos, who has Greek heritage, said in his eligibility declaration his lawyers had received formal advice from the Greek government confirming he had never been a Greek citizen, or entitled to the rights and privileges of one \u2013 but he failed to provide a copy of the legal advice. Sinodinos\u2019s mother and father were born in Cephalonia in Greece but the Liberal senator said in his declaration that he had never been a citizen of any country other than Australia. The Liberal senator, who is on leave from the parliament and being treated for cancer, later released a letter from the Greek embassy saying there was no record of his registration in Greece. The One Nation senator Peter Georgiou, who was born in Perth, also says he is eligible to sit in parliament, despite his parents and grandparents being born in Greece, but he does not say what steps he took to confirm his eligibility before he nominated for for election. Georgiou provided a letter, dated 16 November 2017, from the Hellenic Republic Embassy of Greece in Canberra, that says the acquisition of Greek nationality and citizenship can be proven by registration within the municipal and male registries of the Greek state, and no registration exists for Georgiou, so he cannot be considered a Greek citizen or national. Georgiou entered parliament in March 2017, replacing Rod Culleton, who was disqualified by the high court under section 44 of the constitution. The Liberal senator Anne Ruston also declared her paternal grandfather was born in Burwell, England, in 1890, which may have made her father, born in South Australia, a citizen by descent. But Ruston claimed that because neither of her parents had ever \u201capplied for, or registered interest in, obtaining citizenship from the United Kingdom\u201d they were both \u201csolely Australian citizens all of their lives\u201d. She said she had previously sought advice on her eligibility to get a UK passport and was informed she had \u201cno rights to UK citizenship\u201d. Liberal senator, Zed Seselja, disclosed that his mother and father were born in the \u201cnow defunct\u201d Yugoslavia, in Manja Vas and Dugi Otok in modern-day Croatia. He said he was not a citizen of either country, adding in a further statement that the Croatian president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107, had confirmed this to Malcolm Turnbull on a state visit in August. In a statement issued via Facebook on Monday, Gallagher said she did not believe she should refer herself to the high court but she recognised \u201cultimately that will be a matter for the Senate to determine\u201d. Gallagher released legal advice from English barrister Adrian Berry that she had taken \u201call steps to renounce British citizenship\u201d on 20 April but the same advice states she remained a British citizen until 16 August. In separate constitutional advice, Gallagher\u2019s lawyers claim that the test in Sykes v Cleary, reaffirmed in the \u201ccitizenship seven\u201d decision, allowed that a person was eligible if they had taken \u201call steps reasonably required\u201d to renounce foreign citizenship. Malcolm Turnbull has released separate legal advice arguing that people who had taken steps to renounce citizenship but were still foreign citizens on nomination date were not eligible. The high court\u2019s unanimous judgment explicitly warned that section 44 \u201cdoes not disqualify only those who have not made reasonable efforts to conform to its requirements\u201d. The judgment states that a person who \u201cretains the status of subject or citizen of a foreign power\u201d at the time of nomination will be disqualified \u201cexcept where the operation of the foreign law is contrary to the constitutional imperative that an Australian citizen not be irremediably prevented by foreign law\u201d from participation in representative government. University of Sydney constitutional expert Anne Twomey has said the law on reasonable steps is still unclear. \u201cIt is possible to argue that a strict reading of the judgment is that a person is disqualified if he or she is a dual citizen at time of nomination regardless of what steps were taken beforehand,\u201d Twomey said. As well as the declarations in the Senate, a resolution covering members of the House of Representatives passed through the lower house on Monday, with declarations expected by mid-week. The new Senate declarations suggest that a handful of senators had historical problems with dual citizenships \u2013 the Liberal Dean Smith, the Green Nick McKim, and the Labor senators Louise Pratt and Lisa Singh. The Labor senator Sam Dastyari also outlined the exhaustive steps he took to renounce his Iranian citizenship over the months leading to his arrival in the Senate in August 2013."
"16||The 100 best nonfiction books: No 96 \u2013 Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions by John Donne (1624)On the eve of his daughter\u2019s wedding, in late November 1623, the poet John Donne was struck down by a mysterious \u201crelapsing fever\u201d (so-called because the patient often died during convalescence) and reduced to many weeks of frailty, in which he was \u201cbarred of my ordinary diet, which is reading\u201d. What exactly it was that Donne suffered from, and survived, is not known. Some say typhus. The patient himself believed that he was on his deathbed, that the illness reflected his own sinfulness and amounted to a divine rebuke. His response was at once pious and literary: he asked for pen and paper in order to record, for himself, the experience of this \u201cemergent occasion\u201d. (He also wrote Hymne to God my God, in my Sicknesse.) As well as hymns, in this enfeebled condition, the poet also turned to a new and sombre kind of prose, his urgent response to the threat of imminent extinction. Incredibly, he planned, wrote, and finally published, Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, his intense meditation on the meaning of life and death, in a matter of days, while still convalescing. Written with astonishing speed and intensity, the work was registered with the Stationers\u2019 Company on 9 January 1624 and published without delay: rarely has such a dramatic affliction had such an immediate literary outcome. Many of the books in this series are an answer to a crisis of one kind or another. Donne\u2019s Devotions, a neglected classic, actually braids the author\u2019s personal \u201cemergency\u201d into the title. Writing to a friend, he described the process whereby the thoughts sponsored by his \u201crelapsing fever\u201d brought this book into the world: \u201cThough I have left my bed, I have not left my bedside; I sit there still, and as a prisoner discharged sits at the prison door to beg fees, so I sit here to gather crumbs. I have used this leisure, to put the meditations I had in my sickness into some such order as may minister some holy delight. They arise to so many sheets (perchance 20) as that without staying for that furniture of an epistle, that my friends importun\u2019d me to print them, I importune my friends to receive them printed.\u201d Like all Donne\u2019s greatest writing, these Devotions, as the poet and critic Andrew Motion has written, \u201care a performance, and because they are a performance, we feel held at arm\u2019s length. To put it another way: Donne\u2019s sickbed is a stage and we admire the patient as if we were looking at him across footlights.\u201d The shape of the Devotions helps condition this response. The 23 sections correspond to the 23 days of the poet\u2019s fever. Entitled \u201cThe Stations of the Sickness\u201d, each of these is divided into three parts: \u201cMeditations upon our Humane Condition\u201d, \u201cExpostulations, and Debatements with God\u201d and \u201cPrayers, upon several occasions, to him\u201d. Within these sections, the reader encounters a succession of dazzling observations: \u201cWe study health, and we deliberate upon our meats, and drink, and air, and exercises; and we hew, and we polish every stone, that goes to that building; and so our health is a long and regular work. But in a minute a cannon batters all, overthrows all, demolishes all; a sickness unprevented for all our diligence, unsuspected for all our curiosity; nay, undeserved if we consider only disorder, summons us, seizes us, possesses us, destroys us in an instant.\u201d As well as reflecting on the shocking propinquity of life and death, Donne is tormented by his isolation, as a patient: \u201cAs sickness is the greatest misery, so the greatest misery of sickness is solitude\u2026 Solitude is a torment which is not threatened in hell itself.\u201d From his sickbed, he hears the bell in the neighbouring square and translates the moment into one of his most famous lines: \u201cNever send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.\u201d As a Christian, a famous love poet who became a great priest, he is eager to address his admiration (and some anxieties) to the almighty: \u201cMy God, my God, thou art a direct God, may I not say a literal God, a God that wouldst be understood literally and according to the plain sense of all that thou sayest ? But thou art also\u2026 a figurative, a metaphorical God too.\u201d Inspired by his metaphorical God, Donne employs the imagery associated with these \u201cdevotions\u201d to express his faith: \u201cAll mankind is of one author, and in one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language.\u201d Or, to phrase this is more secular terms, he is acutely aware, in the Devotions, of having turned his body into a text: \u201cI have cut up mine own anatomy, dissected myself,\u201d he writes, before placing himself, with a poet\u2019s egotism, once more at the centre of God\u2019s concerns: \u201cThese spots are but the letters in which thou has written thine own name and conveyed thyself to me.\u201d Donne needs God. \u201cEnable me by thy grace to look forward to mine end,\u201d he writes, confronting his mortality. If that seems alien and remote, in an age dominated by agnosticism and aetheism, other some other passages are both touching and strikingly modern: \u201cDeath is in an old man\u2019s door, he appears and tells him so, and death is at a young man\u2019s back, and says nothing; age is a sickness, and youth is an ambush; and we need so many physicians as may make up a watch, and spy every inconvenience. There is scarce any thing that hath not killed somebody; a hair, a feather hath done it; nay, that which is our best antidote against it hath done it, the best cordial hath been deadly poison.\u201d A Signature Sentence \u201cNo man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend\u2019s, or of thine own were; any man\u2019s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.\u201d Three To Compare Jeremy Taylor: The Rule and Exercises of Holy Living (1650) Sir Thomas Browne: Urn Burial (1658) Thomas Cranmer: The Book of Common Prayer (1662)"
